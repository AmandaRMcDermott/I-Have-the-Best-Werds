Russia,2008,"citizens of russia,deputies and members of the federation council,i will begin this address with an evaluation of events so far this year.",PAFA
Russia,2008,our country held elections to its key institutions of power this year.,PAFA
Russia,2008,a new government was formed following the presidential election and the parliamentary parties began full scale work in the new state duma.implementation began of new plans for long-term economic and social development.,PAFA
Russia,2008,work is underway on factories and roads.,PAFA
Russia,2008,the armed forces are being modernised and re-armed.,PAFA
Russia,2008,we are spreading and developing new technology.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"we are establishing educational, scientific and medical centres.",PAFA
Russia,2008,our country’s sportspeople have achieved some memorable victories.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"but for our citizens, for all of us, this year has not just been a time of new hopes and achievements.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"events of great significance for each one of us in this country, i am sure, have taken place, events that have also been a serious test for all of russia.i am talking about the barbaric attack on south ossetia, and also about the growing global financial crisis.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"these two very different problems have some common features and, one could say, have a common cause.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"the georgian army’s attack on russian peacekeepers resulted in tragedy for many thousands of people, for entire peoples.",PAFA
Russia,2008,this provocation led to a sharp increase in tension throughout the entire caucasus region.,PAFA
Russia,2008,the conflict in the caucasus was used as a pretext for nato naval vessels to enter the black sea and then to speed up the imposition of an american missile defence system on europe.,PAFA
Russia,2008,this situation forces russia to take measures in response (which i will talk about today).,PAFA
Russia,2008,"thus, tbilisi’s adventure in its own backyard has had repercussions that go far beyond the region, have increased tension across europe and throughout the whole world, cast doubts on the effectiveness of the international security institutions and destabilised the foundations of the world order.",PAFA
Russia,2008,the global financial crisis also began as a ‘local crisis’ on the u.s. domestic market.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"as the biggest developed economy, tightly linked to the markets in all the developed countries, when the u.s. economy began to slide it pulled financial markets all around the globe with it in its fall.",PAFA
Russia,2008,this crisis has now become global in scale.,PAFA
Russia,2008,this tendency of local problems to take on a global character has become a typical feature of our interdependent world.,PAFA
Russia,2008,we have long since made our choice in favour of far-reaching integration into the world economy.,PAFA
Russia,2008,we are aware of our responsibilities.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"having gained some considerable advantages during the period of active global economic growth, russia is ready now to stand together with other countries to address the difficulties that have slowed this growth down.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"but we need to put in place mechanisms that can block the mistaken, selfish and at times simply dangerous decisions made by some members of the international community.",PAFA
Russia,2008,it makes no sense to hide the fact that the tragedy of tskhinvali was made possible in part by the conceit of an american administration that closed its ears to criticism and preferred the road of unilateral decisions.i think that this idea that emerged in the united states after the soviet union collapsed that its view is the only indisputably correct view led the u.s. authorities also into making serious economic miscalculations.,PAFA
Russia,2008,they let this currency bubble grow in the interests of stimulating domestic growth but did not bother coordinating their decisions with the other players on the global markets and neglected even the most basic sense of measure.,PAFA
Russia,2008,they did not listen to the numerous warnings from their partners (including from us).,PAFA
Russia,2008,"as a result they have caused damage to themselves and to others.but, as the saying goes, every cloud has a silver lining.",PAFA
Russia,2008,the mistakes and crises of 2008 are a lesson to all responsible nations that it is time for action.,PAFA
Russia,2008,we need to radically reform the political and economic systems.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"russia, in any event, will insist on this.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"we will work together on this with the united states, the european union, the bric countries and all parties with an interest in reform.",PAFA
Russia,2008,we will do everything possible to make the world a fairer and safer place.i am sure that we can achieve this because our country is economically and politically strong.,PAFA
Russia,2008,the military operations in august and the worrying news from the world markets have clearly demonstrated the maturity of our civil society and the political unity of our country.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"it was pleasing to see (and i say this with sincere gratitude) that our country’s big political parties acted in a spirit of solidarity during the events in the south caucasus, and that the anti-crisis measures aimed at stabilising the economy have also been met with understanding.i think it could hardly be otherwise when we are talking about a people with more than a thousand years of history, a people that have developed and brought civilisation to a vast territory, created a unique culture and built up powerful economic and military potential, a people who act on the solid basis of values and ideals that have taken shape over the centuries and stood the test of time.i would like to say a few words separately about our values, our society’s ideals and moral principles.",PAFA
Russia,2008,i have no intention of giving moral lectures or going off into abstract reflection.,PAFA
Russia,2008,the job of president of russia is very concrete and practical.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"but i say quite frankly, based on my own experience, that it is far from easy to make decisions that will affect the lives (in the most direct sense), welfare and health of thousands of citizens, and the reputation and destiny of a great people.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"when i make these decisions i need to have it firmly in my head that there are things that cannot be given up, things for which we need to fight until victory, things dear to you, dear to me, dear to us all, things without which it is impossible to imagine our country.",PAFA
Russia,2008,our people have a rich spiritual and moral heritage.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"we have much to love and be proud of, much to stand up for and defend, and much to aspire towards.",PAFA
Russia,2008,this is why we will stand firm in the caucasus.,PAFA
Russia,2008,this is why we will overcome the global financial crisis and emerge from it stronger than ever.now i would like to speak about our values.,PAFA
Russia,2008,they are well known.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"there is justice, which we understand as political equality, honest courts and responsible leaders.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"justice is embodied in practice as social guarantees and the fight against poverty and corruption, the efforts to give each individual a decent place in our society and give the russian nation as a whole a worthy place in the system of international relations.there is freedom – personal, individual freedom.it means economic freedom, freedom of speech and religion, freedom to choose one’s place of residence and one’s job.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"and there is general national freedom, the independence and freedom of the russian state.",PAFA
Russia,2008,there is the welfare and dignity of human life.,PAFA
Russia,2008,there is interethnic peace and the unity of diverse cultures.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"there is protection for small peoples, and the recognition of south ossetia’s and abkhazia’s independence is an example of this protection.there are family traditions, love and faithfulness, care for the young and for the old.there is patriotism, along with the most sober and critical look at our country’s history and our far from ideal present, belief in russia that shines through no matter what the circumstances, deep-rooted love for our native land and our great culture.these are our values, the foundations of our society and our moral beacons.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"to put things more simply, it is these self-evident things that we all understand that are what make us a single people, what make us russia.these are the things that we will never give up no matter what the circumstances.",PAFA
Russia,2008,our values form our vision of the future.,PAFA
Russia,2008,we aspire to a fair society of free people.,PAFA
Russia,2008,we know that russia will be a prosperous and democratic country.,PAFA
Russia,2008,it will be a strong country that offers its people a comfortable life.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"it will be the best country in the world for the most talented, demanding, independent and critically-inclined citizens.i want you all to know that our goals remain unchanged.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"the sharp fluctuations in the political and economic situation, the turbulence in the world economy and even the rise in military and political tension will not serve as a pretext for dismantling democratic institutions or for nationalising industry and finance.",PAFA
Russia,2008,citizens’ political freedom and private property are sacred.i want to stress that the state authorities will fulfil all their commitments to the public.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"the government cabinet and the executive authorities at every level in their daily work will pay the utmost attention to people’s savings, pensions and all the social guarantees and will fulfil their responsibilities.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"in this respect, i remind the heads of the ministries and agencies, the country’s regional authorities and the local government institutions that, in accordance with article 7 of the russian constitution, the russian federation is a social state that ensures free development for individuals and at the same time provides social protection.",PAFA
Russia,2008,any infringements of civic freedoms and any action that worsens people’s material situation are therefore not only amoral but also illegal.,PAFA
Russia,2008,much has already been done to protect our economy from external risks.,PAFA
Russia,2008,it was not in vain that we built up our gold and currency and budget reserves.,PAFA
Russia,2008,it was not in vain that we moved over to medium-term budget planning.,PAFA
Russia,2008,as soon at the global financial crisis began making its effects felt on our financial system we took rapid steps to normalise the situation.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"the government adopted an action programme to minimise the effects of the crisis in russia, improve the banking system’s health and support specific economic sectors.",PAFA
Russia,2008,the important thing now is to implement these measures in full.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"i draw the attention of the government, the central bank and all the state organisations to the fact that there can be no delay in implementing these measures.",PAFA
Russia,2008,we need to remove the ‘financial clots’ that have formed in our economy.,PAFA
Russia,2008,we need to take action to ensure that the money allocated gets to the final recipients.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"i am referring here to the enterprises in crucial sectors such as agriculture, construction, machine-building and the defence industry.",PAFA
Russia,2008,i am also talking about small businesses.,PAFA
Russia,2008,in this situation it is important that each rouble be spent effectively and wisely.we should not delude ourselves that the economic crisis is anywhere near over yet.,PAFA
Russia,2008,we need to keep our wits about us throughout this period and pay close attention to the effectiveness of our work and the justification of our new plans and programmes.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"this applies to the state, business, and to each individual.i am sure that we will manage to resolve all of these difficulties and will soon put in place a modern and independent financial system able to withstand any external challenges and ensure stable solutions to its own tasks.what we need more than anything today is trust and cooperation.",PAFA
Russia,2008,we must not delay the implementation of our strategic programmes not even for a day.,PAFA
Russia,2008,in this situation we need to keep one step ahead.,PAFA
Russia,2008,it is now that we need to lay the foundations that will enable our country to compete in areas where future benefits are to be gained.,PAFA
Russia,2008,we need to work fast to occupy niches in the world economy that are still free.,PAFA
Russia,2008,we need to build new and effective enterprises and spread the use of the most advanced technology.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"this is one of the best anti-crisis ‘medicines’ possible, and it is also an intrinsic part of the ideology on which our country’s modern development is based.our economic policies are based on the concept already declared of the four ‘i’s – institutions, investment, infrastructure and innovation.",PAFA
Russia,2008,this concept has been cemented in the government-approved development concept for the period through to 2020.,PAFA
Russia,2008,we need to implement it in full.,PAFA
Russia,2008,and we need to add a fifth i too – intellect.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"our priority is to produce (and eventually export) knowledge, new technology and advanced culture, cutting-edge achievements in science, education and the arts in other words.",PAFA
Russia,2008,we must be at the cutting edge of innovation in the main economic sectors and in public life.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"neither the state nor the business world can afford to skimp on these priorities, not even in a difficult financial situation.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"our policies are based on an ideology which has people at its centre, people as individuals and citizens, people who are guaranteed equal opportunities from birth.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"their success in life depends on their personal initiative and independence, and on their abilities to innovate and create.",PAFA
Russia,2008,this is more important now than ever before for our country.i repeat that we simply must consolidate around our national priorities.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"the worst thing that could happen in the current situation is to descend into settling scores and dishonest competition, including through use of the administrative resources.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"i draw the attention of the civil servants, staff of the law enforcement agencies, and company officials to the fact that this kind of behaviour is unacceptable and immoral.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"it is easy to earn oneself a reputation today, but just as easy to lose it, and it will take a long time to restore one’s good name, if this is even possible at all.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"those who want to make some ‘easy’ political capital out of the global economic crisis, who have their hearts set on populist chatter and want to destabilise society in order to satisfy their personal ambitions, i advise them to read the constitution.",PAFA
Russia,2008,i consider it my duty to warn those who seek to provoke tension in the political situation.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"we will not allow anyone to inflame social and interethnic strife, deceive people and draw them into illegal action.",PAFA
Russia,2008,we will continue to maintain constitutional order through all the legal means.i remind you that the russian constitution celebrates its fifteenth anniversary in december.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"what is important is not the date itself of course, but the fact that it is the constitution that upholds freedom and justice, human dignity and welfare, protection of family and fatherland, and the unity of our multiethnic people – not just as common values but as legal concepts.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"in other words, the constitution gives them force in practice and supports them with all the resources of the state and with all of its own authority.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"the constitution forms our social institutions and the way of life of millions of people.it is for this reason that in my first address to the federal assembly i feel it necessary to set out my vision of the fundamental laws governing our life, the goals and values of our society, cemented in the constitution and thus having a direct influence on every aspect of our domestic and foreign policy.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"i would like to give a brief analysis of how these goals and values have ensured the development of russia’s statehood, and i want to say a few words in particular on the following points.first is the decisive role the constitution has played in developing democracy in russia.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"as i said, the personal freedom and the maturity of the democratic institutions and procedures that it guarantees are the source for our continued development.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"now, as we come to a new stage in our development, we are setting new goals that call for greater participation by our citizens, political parties and other public institutions.",PAFA
Russia,2008,i will name these new goals.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"second is the constitution’s importance in developing a new legal system and independent courts, and in combating corruption and legal nihilism.",PAFA
Russia,2008,i note that legal nihilism is not a new phenomenon in russia but is something that has its roots deep in our distant past.,PAFA
Russia,2008,fifteen years is too short a time to eradicate such deeply-rooted traditions.,PAFA
Russia,2008,but it is also true that we have not yet made a deep-reaching systemic attempt to address this problem of disregard for the law.,PAFA
Russia,2008,third is the role the constitution plays in continued expansion of free enterprise and economic freedom.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"this is the key to successful development of a middle class, growth of small and medium businesses and the establishment of an innovation economy.fourth is the implementation of the social guarantees set out in the constitution: wages, benefits, pensions and savings.",PAFA
Russia,2008,i repeat that the state authorities will continue to fulfil their commitments to the public even in today’s difficult situation.,PAFA
Russia,2008,i want to remind you too that the constitution prohibits propaganda of social superiority.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"this is a moral law that also has legal force in our country.finally, fifth, the constitution also plays its part in bolstering international law.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"international law, as we know, is made up of states’ observance of their national constitutions and their commitments under international agreements and treaties.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"therefore, the better states coordinate their actions on the international stage with the provisions of international law, the greater the level of security in our world.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"colleagues,the constitution paves the way for russia’s renewal as a free nation and a society that holds law and the dignity of each individual as its highest values.the cult of the state and the illusory wisdom of the administrative apparatus have prevailed in russia over many centuries.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"individuals with their rights and freedoms, personal interests and problems, have been seen as at best a means and at worst an obstacle for strengthening the state’s might.",PAFA
Russia,2008,this view endured throughout many centuries.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"i would like to quote pyotr stolypin, who said, “what we need to do first is create citizens, and once this has been achieved civic spirit will prevail of its own accord in russia.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"first comes the citizen and then the civic spirit, but we have usually preached the other way round”.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"this is why the adoption in 1993 of a constitution proclaiming the individual, their life, rights and property as the highest value was an unprecedented event in russia’s history, and we should thank all those who took part in drafting and adopting this document.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"some of them are present here today.today, at a new stage in its development, russian society affirms its commitment to the constitution’s democratic values.",PAFA
Russia,2008,it has for the most part become familiar with the practice and procedures of democracy.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"not so long ago, democracy was associated in our people’s minds with chaos, helplessness and degradation, but the new russia has proven its ability to fulfil its social commitments and ensure economic growth, guarantee our people’s rights and demand compliance with the law, and successfully combat terrorism and outside aggression.not so long ago, 15 years ago, people were still asking themselves whether or not democracy was the road forward for russia.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"today the answer is clear, democracy is the way forward, and no one disputes this now.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"the question today is how russia’s democracy should continue its development.i think that russia’s people are much readier now for free activity (professional, public and political) than they were at the start of reforms.",PAFA
Russia,2008,they have no need for the state to look after their every step.,PAFA
Russia,2008,more and more people rely on themselves above all and believe that their personal success – and thus the country’s success too – depends on themselves and their personal achievements.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"this means it is absolutely essential and also possible to increase the level of trust in society.but as was the case 20 years ago, the bureaucracy still does not trust free citizens and free activity.",PAFA
Russia,2008,this logic pushes it into dangerous conclusions and acts.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"the bureaucracy from time to time casts fear over the business world, pressuring it to keep in line and not to take what they consider wrong action, takes control of this or that media outlet, trying to stop it from saying what they consider the wrong thing, meddles in the electoral process, preventing the election of what they consider the wrong person, and puts pressure on the courts, stopping them from handing down what they consider the wrong verdict.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"the result is that the state bureaucracy is the biggest employer, most active publisher, best producer, and is its own court, own political party, and ultimately its own people.",PAFA
Russia,2008,this is a completely ineffective system and leads only to corruption.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"it gives rise to legal nihilism on a mass scale, goes counter to the constitution, and hinders the development of innovative economic and democratic institutions.a strong state and an all-powerful bureaucracy are not one and the same thing.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"civil society needs a strong state as a tool for development and maintaining order, and for protecting and strengthening democratic institutions.",PAFA
Russia,2008,but an all-powerful bureaucracy is a mortal danger for civil society.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"this is why our society must continue calm and steady work to build up its democratic institutions and not delay this work.the democratic institutions established over these years (established by decree from above, it must be said) need to develop roots in all groups in society.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"for this to happen, we need to constantly prove that the democratic system is the one that works.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"we also need to entrust a growing number of social and political responsibilities directly to our citizens, their organisations and local self-government.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"of course the state will retain the responsibilities that fall within its jurisdiction, and action must be pragmatic and accompanied by a sober assessment of the risks, but action is necessary.above all therefore, i propose taking measures to improve the level and quality of public representation in government, measures that will encourage the public to become more involved in political life.",PAFA
Russia,2008,more than 90 percent of voters voted for the parties that entered the state duma in 2007.,PAFA
Russia,2008,but there were almost five million people who voted for parties that did not make it into the state duma.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"these people have no representation at federal level, though they showed their civic activeness and went to vote in the election.",PAFA
Russia,2008,this is an unfair situation and something must be done about it.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"i do not think, however, that it is necessary at this point to lower the barrier set by law for entry to the state duma.",PAFA
Russia,2008,my first proposal is therefore to give guarantees for voters who vote for the so-called small parties.,PAFA
Russia,2008,i think that parties that have received from 5–7 percent of the vote could be given a guaranteed one or two seats in the state duma.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"this would make it possible to keep in place the system of incentives for consolidation of the big parties, something we have been working on these last years, the parties that form the main frame of our national political system.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"and at the same time, it would ensure a parliamentary tribune for the small parties that represent the interests of a sizeable number of people.second, i think it possible that nominations of heads of the executive authorities in the regions could be made only by the parties that have won the biggest number of votes in the regional elections, and by no one else.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"this would mean that only public, open political organisations representing the bulk of the country’s population would have the right to put forward candidacies for these posts.third, the practice of having to provide a sum of money as collateral should be abolished for elections at every level.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"it is not money that should decide participation in elections but people’s opinions, the party’s reputation and voters’ confidence in its programme.we should also discuss gradual reduction of the number of voters’ signatures that need to be collected for participation in elections to the state duma.",PAFA
Russia,2008,parties that receive more than five percent of the vote in the next election to the state duma or that have a faction in more than a third of the regional parliaments should be exempted altogether from collecting signatures.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"currently, only parties that have a faction in the state duma are exempt from this requirement.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"fourth, the federation council should be made up only of people elected to the representative assemblies and deputies from the local self-government bodies of the region in question.",PAFA
Russia,2008,the residence requirement that requires members of the federation council to have lived for a particular number of years in the region should be abolished.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"in this way, people who have gone through a procedure of public election, have experience of working with voters and represent not only the regional authorities but most importantly represent the region’s people will work in the federation council.the necessary changes should be carried out without upheavals and big shuffles of personnel, allowing a transition period and measures to preserve the federation council’s human resource potential.fifth, there should be gradual reduction of the minimum number of members required for registering a new political party.sixth, amendments should be made to law on political parties making it compulsory to carry out rotation of the party’s leadership so that one and the same person cannot occupy a leadership post in the party for longer than a set term.seventh, the representative bodies of local self-government should be able to have more effective control over and, if necessary, even remove from office the heads of municipalities.",PAFA
Russia,2008,it is long since time to address the issue of making municipal heads more responsible for the quality and results of their work.giving the local government representative bodies these kinds of important powers also implies greater quality demands on their own work.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"they should be elected with the most active participation of local people’s political and non-political groups – human rights groups, volunteer organizations, philanthropic and educational organizations and so on.",PAFA
Russia,2008,i remind you that the law allows for not only political parties but also public organizations to put forward electoral lists for municipal elections.,PAFA
Russia,2008,but most parties and public organizations are still poorly represented on municipal councils.,PAFA
Russia,2008,this provision in the law should be made to work effectively.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"eighth, i ask you to take additional measures to encourage non-governmental organisations and the public council to become more involved in the legislative process.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"i think it would be useful to have these groups take compulsory part in examining draft laws that affect the most important issues for our people: people’s freedoms, healthcare issues, property issues.",PAFA
Russia,2008,this would require amendments to be made accordingly to the rules and regulations of the state duma and the federation council.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"ninth, parliamentary parties should have clear guarantees that their work will be covered by the state media.tenth, freedom of speech should be backed up by technological innovation.",PAFA
Russia,2008,experience shows that it is practically of no use to persuade the bureaucrats to ‘leave the media in peace’.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"instead of persuading, we should work more actively to expand the free internet and digital television space.",PAFA
Russia,2008,no bureaucrat can obstruct discussion on the internet or censor thousands of channels at once.i am sure that these measures will help to raise the quality of public representation and make it possible to take public interests into account better.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"it will give people greater trust in government and increase solidarity within society.citizens of russia, friends,i have just set out concrete steps to take to develop civil society and a democratic state.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"these steps are dictated by our desire to see russia become an advanced and progressive country in the nearest future, a country that offers people a comfortable life, and is a prosperous community of free people based on fair laws.",PAFA
Russia,2008,these are priority tasks and we must act without delay.,PAFA
Russia,2008,there can be no doubt that we will work together to continue this process of democratic transformation.we have a lot of work and serious steps ahead.,PAFA
Russia,2008,this includes continued decentralisation and humanisation of the social organisation and political system.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"the freer and more diverse our public life, the more dynamic our economy and the more intense our political competition, the more solid and stable will be the fundamental institutions of our democracy, the pillars that hold up the whole edifice of the democratic state.i think many will agree with me that the russian political culture and our public opinion give this role primarily to the president and the federal parliament as the two main institutions of state power at the highest level, and the two institutions distinguished by the fact that they are elected through national popular ballot and act on behalf of the entire country.i am sure that our movement towards freedom and democracy will be successful and sustained only if the president and state duma can maintain a high level of authority founded not only on election campaign promises but also on the practical results of their work, and if they have enough time to put their promises into practice and really demonstrate the results of their work to the people, give an account of their performance to the voters and the country.today we are carrying out long-term development programmes and are in the process of making a transition to a new type of economy.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"we find ourselves at the same time having to address a whole host of difficult issues: overcome the global crisis and the difficulties of competition, modernise our armed forces and manage a huge and complex ethnically and culturally mixed country, and in these conditions strengthen our democratic institutions and maintain stability.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"this is not all we have before us, but these are the most important reasons motivating me to make two proposals.first, we need to give the federal assembly greater constitutional powers.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"the state duma should be given responsibility for carrying control functions (article 103) with regard to the executive authorities, and there should be a constitutional provision requiring the cabinet to report annually to the state duma on the results of its work and answer questions put directly by the parliament.second, we should increase the constitutional mandates of the president and state duma to six and five years respectively.these issues have been raised repeatedly since the 1990s.",PAFA
Russia,2008,discussions on these subjects have gone on for a long time.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"many have made reference to history, which abounds with examples of democratic countries changing the terms and mandates of their state bodies.i will not list all of these examples.",PAFA
Russia,2008,these cases are well known.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"what i want to say is that we are not talking about constitutional reform but about adjustments to the constitution, about adjustments that are important but are nonetheless no more than clarifications and do not change the political and legal essence of the current institutions.",PAFA
Russia,2008,these adjustments provide rather an additional resource for the institutions’ stable work.,PAFA
Russia,2008,there is no place for a ‘reforming itch’ with regard to the constitution.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"the constitution is effective, it works, and its basic provisions should remain unchanged for many years to come.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"civic rights and freedoms, the nation’s sovereignty, the state system and federal organisation, the organisation principles of the judicial system and local self-government, and the other foundations of our constitutional order have been set for a long-term historical period.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"as the guarantor of the constitution, i will preserve and protect these fundamental provisions.colleagues, corruption is the greatest enemy of a free and democratic society.",PAFA
Russia,2008,you know that the national anti-corruption plan was signed in july and that i have submitted a corresponding package of draft laws to the state duma.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"their main feature is that they take a comprehensive, systemic and targeted approach.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"they are designed above all to eradicate the causes of corruption, which has its roots in the shortcomings in our government and economic mechanisms.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"amendments are now being made to the laws regulating the activities of customs officers, interior ministry personnel, the staff of the prosecutor-general’s office, federal security service, magistrates and court staff, the civil service, municipal staff and others.",PAFA
Russia,2008,it is very important that anti-corruption effort focus on prevention measures and on making it not advantageous to practice corruption.what are the measures proposed?,PAFA
Russia,2008,"first, we need to seriously increase the demands on state and municipal officials.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"by this, i mean requiring them to provide additional information on their incomes and assets, including assets belonging to family members.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"the truthfulness of these declarations will be carefully verified, even through investigative detective work if necessary.second, state and municipal officials should be required to behave in accordance with their codes of ethics.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"failure to comply with these rules should result in disciplinary action and, where necessary, in administrative and criminal liability.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"third, measures are being introduced for criminal penalty of abuse of power by people carrying out management functions in non-state organisations.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"these penalties will correspond to those applied to civil servants.fourth, legal entities will be subject to administrative liability for making a bribe on behalf of or in the interests of a legal entity.",PAFA
Russia,2008,there are also a whole series of other measures that are well known now.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"furthermore, control will be established over the assets situation of people with special legal status, above all judges.these measures are strict, but they are necessary.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"as nikolai korkunov, a pre-revolutionary specialist in state law rightly noted, “affirming the law always comes across as an attack on the arbitrariness of those in power”.",PAFA
Russia,2008,our preferences here are obvious.i think that by creating the legal basis for our anti-corruption efforts we will lay a good foundation for this work.,PAFA
Russia,2008,this will enable us to build our work in a systemic and consistent fashion and take additional measures should the need arise.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"i hope that this package of laws will be adopted very soon and successfully put into practice.of course, aside from legislative measures we also need to improve the way our state bodies work and optimise and clarify their powers.",PAFA
Russia,2008,we need to ensure competition and objectivity when holding tenders and concluding state or municipal contracts.,PAFA
Russia,2008,we need to remove unjustified restrictions and prohibitions in economic activity and establish conditions for effective targeted support for people in the social sphere.now i would like to say a few words about developing the judicial system.,PAFA
Russia,2008,we know that an independent and honest court is the basis for a just public order.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"as our democratic state grows stronger, the courts will begin to play an even greater role.the problems of creating a judicial system have in large measure been resolved.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"this includes expanding the jurisdiction of the courts in dealing with complaints against state bodies and officials, as well as offering compensation for damage done by their illegal actions.in the near future other innovations will be introduced.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"for example, i have asked that a report be prepared on the possibility of transferring problems concerning the activities of magistrates to the federal level.",PAFA
Russia,2008,this would require certain expenditures but the resolution of such problems would complete the formation of a coherent judicial hierarchy.,PAFA
Russia,2008,i am also introducing a bill to reduce the duration of civil cases and to introduce penalties for the creation of obstacles designed to drag out court proceedings excessively.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"in addition, it is necessary to establish a mechanism for addressing the damage caused by violations of citizens’ rights to trial within a reasonable time, and to guarantee the full and timely implementation of court decisions.finally, in the near future we will adopt a law “on ensuring access to information concerning the activities of courts in the russian federation“.",PAFA
Russia,2008,it will apply to all the courts and give people the opportunity to obtain reliable information about the functioning of the judicial system.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"in addition, for the first time it will provide a detailed account of various forms of disclosure, including via the internet.such changes will clarify and explain judicial rules and procedures for citizens.",PAFA
Russia,2008,and in the final analysis it will help strengthen the national mechanism for application of the european convention on human rights and fundamental freedoms.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"in doing so, we need to make a number of important decisions.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"above all, it is crucial that there be a strict enforcement of judgments.",PAFA
Russia,2008,this is an important part of citizens' rights to a fair trial.i want to stress that the execution of court decisions is still a huge problem.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"and this is the problem of all courts, including the constitutional court.",PAFA
Russia,2008,of course problems vary but they do have one thing in common: a lack of real accountability on the part of officials together with citizens themselves who neglect to execute court decisions.,PAFA
Russia,2008,this responsibility should be assumed.we must not forget about such a fundamental issue as humanizing the law and the ways it is applied.,PAFA
Russia,2008,the courts should be more careful when choosing to bring accused in custody and punish the convicted by excluding them from society.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"at the same time, law enforcement agencies and the judicial system must ensure the effective protection of the rights and interests of victims of crimes.as everybody knows, the law must be seen as more than just the product of pragmatic measures but also as “the condition of genuinely human existence”, as the famous russian lawyer boris chicherin once put it.",PAFA
Russia,2008,and i think that the discussion at the 7th congress of judges of all the above innovations and the existing problems will give judicial reform in this country an important new impetus.the introduction of local self-government institutions and strengthening the federal basis of the state has been of fundamental importance for our society.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"as you know, government policies in these matters are largely arrived at by trial and error, based on the experience of other states and the ways older forms of federalism have developed in the world.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"yet russia is the most multi-regional, multi-national and multi-confessional nation in the world.",PAFA
Russia,2008,for this reason what we have undertaken today is being undertaken for the very first time.let me remind you that on 1 january 2009 the transition period established for the implementation of all the provisions of the federal law ”on general principles of local self-government in the russian federation“ ends.,PAFA
Russia,2008,but we will continue to improve this legislation.i must say that that in two regions of the russian federation – the chechen republic and ingushetia – there is no local self-government.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"that is, citizens of these republics are being unjustly deprived of their constitutional rights.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"i know that the leadership of these regions is planning a form of local self-government by october next year, and i encourage them in this endeavour.now a few words on the further development of russian federalism.",PAFA
Russia,2008,its modern form was established on the basis of the constitution.,PAFA
Russia,2008,the constitutional court played a special role in its formation.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"in its decisions it has had to find a balance between the interests of different levels of government, and settle some quite sharp disagreements.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"this applies to disputes between the federal and regional authorities, and disputes about the various ways of creating a local government.",PAFA
Russia,2008,and we are still confronted with these problems today.what is especially important for us today?,PAFA
Russia,2008,the first thing is to achieve an optimal balance of power between the federation and the regions.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"as you know, we have done a good job, a great job on this.",PAFA
Russia,2008,but we are still attempting to clarify the parameters of this division every year.,PAFA
Russia,2008,these include making changes to the lists of resources needed at both federal and regional levels in order to completely fulfill the government’s responsibilities.,PAFA
Russia,2008,i think that we should come back to this issue and finally decide what assets and how much of them the regions need.second: thus far we have not come up with the optimal placement scheme for the territorial structures of federal executive bodies in russia.,PAFA
Russia,2008,there are so many of them that we need to cut back.,PAFA
Russia,2008,and we also need a plan for their effective cooperation with regional authorities.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"let me remind you that in accordance with paragraph 2 of article 77 of the constitution, federal executive authorities and the executive bodies of the federation’s regions are part of an integrated system.however, this article of the constitution has not yet been implemented in full.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"the government cabinet should re-examine the issue and submit the necessary proposals, including based on criteria for evaluating the activities of the federal executive authorities and that of the relevant regional bodies.third: legal authorities in the regions of the russian federation have submitted many initiatives to the state duma but very few of them are adopted as laws.",PAFA
Russia,2008,this is due to insufficient elaboration of these initiatives and the large number of alternative bills in the duma.,PAFA
Russia,2008,in general there is little awareness in the regions of the legislative process at the federal level.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"i think that the federation council could play a much larger role than it does now, as coordinator of the legislative activity on the part of the regional representative bodies.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"please submit such proposals, taking into account what i have proposed about its new staffing regime.finally, another factor that could greatly enhance our federation is the support of ethnic traditions and cultures of the peoples of russia.",PAFA
Russia,2008,i think this is crucial not only for strengthening the federal framework but also for ensuring the harmonious functioning of our society and the unity of the russian nation.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"it will help guarantee a stable, civilised development of the entire country.i have already said that interethnic peace is one of our key values.",PAFA
Russia,2008,historically we have enjoyed a unique and extraordinarily rich experience of tolerance and mutual respect.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"at the same time, problems remain that could exacerbate ethnic and sectarian relations.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"they include unemployment (particularly in regions with large working populations), flaws in legislation on property, illegal immigration and a number of other reasons.",PAFA
Russia,2008,such questions are particularly sensitive where certain social and economic issues are still unresolved.,PAFA
Russia,2008,where regional and local authorities are not helping the development of small businesses no new jobs are being created.i want to draw special attention to the necessity of optimising the possibilities for migration within the country and creating real conditions for the increased mobility of russian citizens as an effective way of redistributing labor resources and ensuring citizens’ right to work.the mechanisms regulating international migration need to be improved as well.,PAFA
Russia,2008,they must finally take on a legal form that meets the needs of our country and the scale of the migration involved.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"in russia a flood of immigrants continues to arrive, particularly from the commonwealth.",PAFA
Russia,2008,we know that many of them hope to obtain russian citizenship.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"in general, this is a positive process.",PAFA
Russia,2008,but citizenship must constitute proof of their successful integration into our society and an acceptance of our culture and traditions.,PAFA
Russia,2008,i should also note that we must first establish a balance in the labour market and ensure the interests of russian citizens.dear deputies and members of the federation council!,PAFA
Russia,2008,"no matter how perfect the laws and the policies are that we derive from the constitution, the realisation of what they stand for depends on actual people.",PAFA
Russia,2008,their intellectual energy and creative force are the main wealth of the nation and a basic resource for progressive development.we need to organise a large-scale and systematic search for talent both in russia and abroad.,PAFA
Russia,2008,we must do some headhunting.,PAFA
Russia,2008,this will increase the number of talented young people in basic and applied sciences.,PAFA
Russia,2008,it will speed up the formation of strong public and private centres concerned with the development of new technologies.,PAFA
Russia,2008,it will be of great help to small and medium businesses as they create innovative enterprises.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"i should stress that these are problems for all of us, not only for some new state corporations.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"this is a challenge for all of our society and, at the same time, a chance for everyone to use their abilities.today’s russia and its innovative future economy, its public service, management system and its social services all need a new regime for creating a human resources pool, one that would bring into government, municipal administration and business the most talented, qualified and creative people.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"as you know, i have taken measures to create such a reserve pool.therefore i have instructed the government cabinet and the presidential executive office to launch a programme for the formation and training of reserve managerial personnel, developed jointly by state authorities, local government institutions and public organisations, and to do so before the end of the year.this management reserve pool should include three levels: municipal, regional and federal.",PAFA
Russia,2008,and the most successful managers should become part of a group to be called the presidential thousand.,PAFA
Russia,2008,i think that the whole country should know who the best managers are.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"therefore, information about the most capable specialists in various fields should be available in a russia-wide data base.i believe that the russian education system should play a decisive role in shaping a new generation of professionals.",PAFA
Russia,2008,its previous successes were once recognised around the world.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"today, despite some positive developments, the situation in education leaves much to be desired.",PAFA
Russia,2008,let us be frank: we were once in the vanguard and have now fallen behind.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"this has become a very serious threat to our competitiveness.in addition, the educational system in the proper sense of that word shapes the identity of a person, creates an image of the life of the people.",PAFA
Russia,2008,it passes on the values of the nation to new generations.the development strategy for russian education as a whole will soon be approved by the cabinet.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"its implementation will continue as part of the national project education, based on recently adopted legislation.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"today, i will focus on the education received in primary- and secondary-level school.",PAFA
Russia,2008,this represents one of the longest and most important stages in the life of every human being.,PAFA
Russia,2008,it is crucial both for individual success and for the long-term development of the country.just recently we discussed this with the professional community and formulated basic parameters to modernise our schools.,PAFA
Russia,2008,the main result of this should be a series of goals for school education that will facilitate its rapid development.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"on the basis of these proposals we will prepare a national education strategy, an initiative called our new school.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"it will be divided into five areas.first: already in school children should be able to discover their talents and prepare for life in a high-tech, competitive world.",PAFA
Russia,2008,education's new content should help them meet this challenge.,PAFA
Russia,2008,i suggest that we should develop precisely this kind of new generation of educational standards as rapidly as possible.,PAFA
Russia,2008,their preparation has been delayed.,PAFA
Russia,2008,second: along with the implementation of a new standard for general education we should construct a far-reaching system for finding and supporting talented children and monitoring them throughout the entire period during which their identity develops.third: the teacher plays a key role in the school.,PAFA
Russia,2008,and we need to develop a system of moral and material incentives for keeping the best teachers in our schools and constantly improving their skills.,PAFA
Russia,2008,but more importantly we need to staff our schools with a new generation of teachers.,PAFA
Russia,2008,and not necessarily those having pedagogical education.i support the proposal of the educational community to declare 2010 the year of the teacher in russia.,PAFA
Russia,2008,and i would like to emphasise that we will do everything we can to make teachers respected figures in society.,PAFA
Russia,2008,but teachers themselves should be attentive to the students and respect them.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"this should help the students become independent, creative and self-confident people.fourth: the image of our schools, both the way they present themselves and what actually happens inside them, must change significantly.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"a school can only have a real impact if it is exciting and interesting, if it becomes the centre of not only compulsory education but also of self-development, creativity and sport.let me draw your attention to the fact that russia’s schools do not have the right to fall behind, in the literal and figurative sense of the expression.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"there is a need for not only new educational standards but new standards for constructing school buildings and classrooms, equipped with clinics, cafeterias and gymnasiums.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"children should feel comfortable in their schools, both psychologically and physically.i am instructing the cabinet to develop in the nearest future new principles for our schools, including for their design, construction, and equipment and technical resources.",PAFA
Russia,2008,it is necessary to make full use of the results obtained in the education national project.fifth: it is precisely during the time spent at school that one’s well-being is determined for the rest of one’s life.,PAFA
Russia,2008,today's statistics on the health of schoolchildren are simply appalling.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"yes, i’ll admit that a lot of this depends on the living conditions of the family, on the parents.",PAFA
Russia,2008,but to keep insisting on this as the only reason is unacceptable.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"the time children spend in school represents a significant portion of the day, and so their teachers are implicated in their students’ well-being too.",PAFA
Russia,2008,we need to get away from a homogenizing approach to this matter.,PAFA
Russia,2008,each student should be treated as an individual and the risks to their well-being should be minimized throughout the learning process.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"all the more so because an overloaded curriculum also creates other problems.i am convinced that if the importance of a healthy lifestyle was fully instilled in our students at school, we would have a much easier time dealing with the creation of a modern health care system.the relevant government programme should be adopted as early as this year.",PAFA
Russia,2008,it should focus on mechanisms to ensure the accountability of doctors and medical organisations for quality and performance.,PAFA
Russia,2008,they will expand their opportunities and will be motivated to meet the highest standards.a few words about compulsory health insurance.,PAFA
Russia,2008,we have to admit that it never has been effective in russia.,PAFA
Russia,2008,the rights of insured persons have not been fully achieved.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"despite legislation improving the possibilities for choosing among insurance organisations, medical institutions and even doctors, in real life, the choice is virtually non-existent.",PAFA
Russia,2008,and with the growth of paid medical services voluntary medical insurance has been slow to develop.,PAFA
Russia,2008,all this does not contribute to the development of competition in health care.we must gradually but consistently implement full-value health insurance.,PAFA
Russia,2008,this applies both to its scope and cost.,PAFA
Russia,2008,the state must ensure financial equilibrium in the health insurance system.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"i draw your attention to the fact that we must work on health care issues not for the sake of the industry, but to increase life expectancy and birth rate.",PAFA
Russia,2008,of course we should not forget about the older generations.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"people in those generations, people of retirement age are entitled to a decent life.",PAFA
Russia,2008,therefore the pension system can no longer rely on an abstract measure to determine the average pension.,PAFA
Russia,2008,everyone must be absolutely clear about how he or she can achieve a certain standard of living in retirement.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"clear about how much the state will provide, how much they will receive from mandatory contributions, from their employer, as well as how much people themselves should save.major policy decisions on these issues have already been made, including with respect to increasing the pensions for those who earned part of their pension during the soviet period.",PAFA
Russia,2008,we have also decided to raise tariffs on pension insurance to european standards.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"for employers this represents an additional financial burden and already this year the cabinet will determine how to compensate businesses for this.and finally, we are beginning to implement the approved programme that provides that the state will co-finance voluntary pension savings of russian citizens.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"so far already about 100,000 people have filed applications to participate in this programme in just five weeks.i think that it is these areas, critical areas such as education, health care and pensions where people need to see clearly why economic growth is necessary, feel its benefits and see how they are distributed.dear colleagues!",PAFA
Russia,2008,i have already mentioned the tragic events in south ossetia.,PAFA
Russia,2008,they were largely determined by serious infringements of international law.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"refusing a peaceful, political settlement and legal methods, georgian leadership chose to embark on the most frightful scenario.i will stress once again: the decision to force the aggressor to make peace and the operation undertaken by our military was not against georgia, not against the georgian people, but to save the people of the republic and russian peacekeepers.",PAFA
Russia,2008,to ensure the stable and long-term security of the people of south ossetia and abkhazia.,PAFA
Russia,2008,first and foremost from the potential relapse into criminal adventurism by the regime in tbilisi.the caucasus crisis has demonstrated once again that the use of force by one of the parties to a conflict cannot result in a viable solution.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"in this regard, from the starting point of international law we will continue to contribute to eliminating potential flashpoints for conflicts in neighbouring regions.",PAFA
Russia,2008,and by respecting existing forums we will promote a settlement in nagorno-karabakh and transdniestria.,PAFA
Russia,2008,we will cooperate with all interested parties and reach a mutually acceptable agreement.,PAFA
Russia,2008,i would like to draw some conclusions that go beyond the conflict itself.the first and main conclusion.,PAFA
Russia,2008,in practice a qualitatively new geopolitical situation has been created.,PAFA
Russia,2008,the august crisis simply forced a so-called moment of truth upon us.,PAFA
Russia,2008,we really proved – including to those who sponsored the current regime in georgia – that we are able to protect our citizens.,PAFA
Russia,2008,that we are able to effectively defend our national interests and effectively carry out our peacekeeping responsibilities.the second conclusion.,PAFA
Russia,2008,our armed forces have been restored to combat potential to a considerable degree.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"nevertheless, military leaders need to examine not only our successes but also our mistakes.",PAFA
Russia,2008,and to draw the most serious lessons from these.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"regarding the re-equipment of the army and navy with new, modern equipment, i have already taken the relevant decisions and given orders to the cabinet.",PAFA
Russia,2008,i have approved the design of our armed forces new image.i would add something about what we have had to face in recent years: what is it?,PAFA
Russia,2008,"it is the construction of a global missile defence system, the installation of military bases around russia, the unbridled expansion of nato and other similar ‘presents’ for russia – we therefore have every reason to believe that they are simply testing our strength.",PAFA
Russia,2008,of course we will not let ourselves be dragged into an arms race.,PAFA
Russia,2008,but we must take this into account in defence expenditures.,PAFA
Russia,2008,and we will continue to reliably protect the safety of the citizens of russia.,PAFA
Russia,2008,therefore i will now announce some of the measures that will be taken.,PAFA
Russia,2008,in particular measures to effectively counter the persistent and consistent attempts of the current american administration to install new elements of a global missile defence system in europe.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"for example, we had planned to decommission three missile regiments of a missile division deployed in kozelsk from combat readiness and to disband the division by 2010.",PAFA
Russia,2008,i have decided to abstain from these plans.,PAFA
Russia,2008,nothing will disband.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"moreover, we will deploy the iskander missile system in the kaliningrad region to be able, if necessary, to neutralise the missile defence system.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"naturally, we envisage using the resources of the russian navy for these purposes as well.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"and finally, electronic jamming of the new installations of the u.s. missile defence system will be carried out from the territory of the same westernmost region, that is from kaliningrad.i want to emphasise that we have been forced to take these measures.",PAFA
Russia,2008,we have repeatedly told our partners that we want to engage in positive cooperation.,PAFA
Russia,2008,we want to act against common threats and to work together.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"but unfortunately, very unfortunately, they did not want to listen to us.the third thing.",PAFA
Russia,2008,we have begun integration within the union state and the eurasec.,PAFA
Russia,2008,we will increase the volume and scope of our cooperation in the military and political spheres in the csto.,PAFA
Russia,2008,and we already had a productive conversation on this topic at a summit in moscow.fourth.,PAFA
Russia,2008,the reaction to the events of august 8th and russia’s recognition of the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia once again showed that we live in a world of double standards.,PAFA
Russia,2008,we proceeded responsibly and did so in the interests of restoring international law and justice.,PAFA
Russia,2008,we did so aware that any hesitation or attempt to postpone these steps would result in an even greater humanitarian catastrophe.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"in light of this the position of our partners, who recently made every effort to circumvent international law to achieve the secession of kosovo from serbia and recognise the self-proclaimed country as a subject of international law, seems obviously biased, for they now criticize russia as if nothing had happened.fifth.",PAFA
Russia,2008,the development of the international situation in recent years has been characterised by a number of negative trends.,PAFA
Russia,2008,responses to new threats can be made only through collective efforts.,PAFA
Russia,2008,that is why we favour a carefully planned reform of the united nations to bolster its central role and the effectiveness of its structures and mechanisms.,PAFA
Russia,2008,based on this we need to take steps to develop an international arms control regime.,PAFA
Russia,2008,and progress in us-russian cooperation would play a key role in this respect.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"it's no secret that many states, simply due to inertia, look at which way the wind is blowing in relations between russia and the united states.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"yes, today these relations are not the best.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"and many questions are being raised in russia, including moral ones.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"but i would stress that we have no issue with the american people, we do not have inherent anti-americanism.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"and we hope that our partners, the new administration of the united states of america, will make a choice in favour of full-fledged relations with russia.i would note that the issue of establishing a new global security regime is grossly overdue.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"and it is especially important that we achieve results in the north atlantic territory that comprises russia, the european union and the united states.",PAFA
Russia,2008,i took the initiative to draft a relevant treaty — a treaty on european security.,PAFA
Russia,2008,i repeat: such a document would create absolutely clear and comprehensible rules of conduct.,PAFA
Russia,2008,it would formalize a unified approach to conflict resolution.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"it would facilitate a harmonious position on creating reliable instruments of arms control.incidentally, the settlement of the south ossetia crisis demonstrated that it’s possible to find solutions with europe.",PAFA
Russia,2008,we will deepen our relations with europe in the field of security.,PAFA
Russia,2008,i am sure that they have a good future.where do i think we should engage in practical work?,PAFA
Russia,2008,"first, we need to continue strengthening the legal foundations of international relations.",PAFA
Russia,2008,universally recognised norms and principles of international law should determine the rules of the game in international affairs.,PAFA
Russia,2008,and as all countries cultivate habits that correspond with international law this will help reduce the role of hard power and facilitate the adoption of a collective course of action.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"otherwise we will face international chaos and the practical impossibility of maintaining the preeminence of international law.secondly, the creation of a polycentric international system is more relevant than ever.",PAFA
Russia,2008,this cannot be done without a range of measures including the reform of major international institutions and the general strengthening of multilateral diplomacy.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"together with all interested parties, we will create a truly democratic model of international relations, not allowing any one country to dominate in any sphere.in general arrogance and arguments based on power are no longer as compelling or as effective as before.",PAFA
Russia,2008,the world cannot be run from one capital.,PAFA
Russia,2008,those who refuse to understand this will only create new problems for themselves and others.,PAFA
Russia,2008,and the relevance of strengthening international institutions is heightened by the transition of most countries towards a truly pragmatic multifaceted policy.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"we consider russia's participation in forums such as the g8, the shanghai cooperation organisation, bric, the asia-pacific economic cooperation forum and others in light of this.the third task is creating universal diplomatic methods for resolving crisis situations.",PAFA
Russia,2008,i already talked about this in connection with the lessons from tskhinvali.,PAFA
Russia,2008,i'll add that in order to achieve positive results ‘problematic’ states – wherever they are – must not be isolated but rather involved in dialogue.,PAFA
Russia,2008,and we are ready to contribute to resolving any regional conflicts that occur.fourth.,PAFA
Russia,2008,we need to engage in continuous dialogue with our partners to form the new rules of global financial architecture as rapidly as possible.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"having a monopoly in this sphere was not merely inadequate for the realities of today's global economy, it was also dangerous for all concerned.",PAFA
Russia,2008,and therefore a new financial architecture should protect the interests of all of its participants.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"and we must not allow it to be instrumentalised by any one country or group of countries, or one economic system that will make others pay for its gross errors.as you know, the g20 decided to meet in washington on november 15.",PAFA
Russia,2008,we prepared our suggestions on the basic principles for creating a new economic architecture and sent them to our partners.,PAFA
Russia,2008,we believe that global financial institutions must be able to actually prevent crises and minimise their impact on the rest of the world.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"in whatever country they originate in and whatever market they concern, be it financial, energy or food.the minimum set of objectives includes developing a new risk assessment system which takes into account the interdependence of financial institutions and the real economy, introducing modern technology for disclosing objective information on market participants and their operations, harmonising accounting standards, and increased capital requirements for financial institutions.mandates for these tasks should be distributed among existing or newly formed international organisations and regional ones as well.",PAFA
Russia,2008,and the world’s leading countries must guarantee their effectiveness.,PAFA
Russia,2008,when developing such architecture we should not forget the famous words of economist vasily leontyev who said that the system of free enterprise is comparable to a giant computer that is able to solve its problems itself.,PAFA
Russia,2008,but anyone who has dealt with such computers knows that sometimes they fail and cannot function without supervision.fifth.,PAFA
Russia,2008,already before the end of this year we must adopt a package of laws that creates a foundation for turning russia into one of the world's leading financial centers.,PAFA
Russia,2008,and such a centre should act as the nucleus of an independent and competitive russian financial system.we need to take practical steps to boost the rouble’s role as one of the currencies involved in international payments.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"and finally we need to move over to settlements in roubles – that we have unfortunately delayed – for raw materials exports, and above all oil and gas exports.",PAFA
Russia,2008,we must encourage issuing new securities in roubles and preferably in the russian market.,PAFA
Russia,2008,the ultimate goal of all these processes is to make the rouble a regional currency.i think that such actions will be taken by other fast growing countries as well.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"but the more powerful financial centres there are in the world and the greater our interdependence, the safer and more sustainable global development will be.and another, the sixth task concerns renewing our activities in external economic policy.",PAFA
Russia,2008,keeping to ourselves amounts to a dead-end.,PAFA
Russia,2008,we will continue the process of integration into the global economy.,PAFA
Russia,2008,but we will also need to learn how to combine existing and future competitive advantages in a flexible way.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"and how to effectively protect our economic interests while attracting external resources.we need to actively promote our companies to maximise the benefits of the openness of the russian economy and the current market situation, despite its pitfalls.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"to help them improve their efficiency and enter new markets for goods, technology, and labour.",PAFA
Russia,2008,our competitors are not shy about doing so and yet we often sit idly by.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"and time is passing and with it, of course, money.",PAFA
Russia,2008,what are we waiting for?,PAFA
Russia,2008,we have development institutes.,PAFA
Russia,2008,we have resources.,PAFA
Russia,2008,and we must create a smooth mechanism of support.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"it is also important to build diversified relations with the members of the eurasian economic community and other cis countries, the eu, china, india and other big asian partners.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"and i would also note the opportunities opening up in latin america and africa where interest in cooperation is also evident.and finally, we are ready for mutually beneficial cooperation with all countries and groups committed to developing constructive relations.",PAFA
Russia,2008,we do not believe that the existence of differences on certain issues should prevent us from engaging in frank discussions to solve the most complex problems.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"along with this, any interaction will be extremely pragmatic, taking into account the real impact for our country, for all russian citizens.",PAFA
Russia,2008,and geography is not important in such cooperation.,PAFA
Russia,2008,what is important is a positive spirit and mutual interest.,PAFA
Russia,2008,dear colleagues!,PAFA
Russia,2008,"the goals, values and mechanisms outlined in the constitution have proven viable.",PAFA
Russia,2008,they have helped our society overcome certain difficulties and embark on sustainable development.,PAFA
Russia,2008,and we will continue to use the potential of this fundamental law as much as possible.the main thing is to do everything necessary to help people express themselves.,PAFA
Russia,2008,and especially to open doors for capable and active young people.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"they are the coevals of the new, democratic russia.",PAFA
Russia,2008,"they represent its openness, its freedoms and its desire to be the best.",PAFA
Russia,2008,and they will also bear the responsibility for the preservation of our fundamental values.the free development of individuals and their social protection will always be the priorities of public policy.,PAFA
Russia,2008,this will be our main concern.,PAFA
Russia,2008,it will be our society’s development goal.dear friends!,PAFA
Russia,2008,we live in a free and modern country.,PAFA
Russia,2008,and we have managed to do much.,PAFA
Russia,2008,we have a positive experience in establishing a democratic state.,PAFA
Russia,2008,"and more than success, we have real victories.",PAFA
Russia,2008,and together we are moving forward to find answers to difficult questions.,PAFA
Russia,2008,to succeed again.,PAFA
Russia,2008,and to win again.thank you.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"citizens of russia,deputies and members of the federation council,two months ago, in my article go, russia!",PAFA
Russia,2009,i announced the principles for a new political strategy.,PAFA
Russia,2009,in today’s address to the federal assembly i want to outline the first specific steps for implementing this strategy.,PAFA
Russia,2009,i will tell you about the immediate tasks ahead.the foundation of my vision for the future is the firm conviction that russia can and must become a global power on a completely new basis.,PAFA
Russia,2009,our country’s prestige and national prosperity cannot rest forever on past achievements.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"after all, the oil and gas production facilities that generate most of our budget revenue, the nuclear weapons that guarantee our security, and our industrial and utilities infrastructure – most of this was built by soviet specialists.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"in other words, it was not we who built it.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"it is still keeping our country afloat today, but it is rapidly depreciating both morally and physically.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"the time has come for today’s generation of russians to make their mark and take our country to a new, higher level of civilisation.last century, at tremendous cost and effort, an essentially illiterate country was transformed into what was at that time one of the world’s most influential industrial powers, a leader in creating advanced technology in the space, rocket and nuclear fields.",PAFA
Russia,2009,but the closed society and totalitarian political regime made it impossible to hold onto this lead.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"the soviet union, sadly, remained an industrial and raw materials giant and proved unable to compete against post-industrial societies.in the twenty-first century, our country once again needs to undergo comprehensive modernisation.",PAFA
Russia,2009,this will be our first ever experience of modernisation based on democratic values and institutions.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"instead of a primitive raw materials economy we will create a smart economy producing unique knowledge, new goods and technology of use to people.instead of an archaic society in which the leaders think and decide for everyone we will become a society of clever, free and responsible people.instead of chaotic action dictated by nostalgia and prejudice, we will carry out an intelligent domestic and foreign policy based on purely pragmatic aims.instead of the russia of the past we will build the russia of the present – a modern and forward-looking young nation able to take a worthy place in the global economy.i published my proposal to reflect on how we can overcome our chronic backwardness, dependence on raw materials exports, and corruption, how we can prepare ourselves for the fierce competition on global markets, and create the best possibilities for ensuring that each of us can make full use in practice of our knowledge, opportunities, and experience without depending on higher-ups.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"in other words, i proposed that we reflect on the steps we need to take right now to improve the quality of life in russia and make our country one of the world’s leaders.i received numerous responses and letters of all sorts during the public discussion that followed, and spoke with people of all different political views and professions on ways to develop our economy, education and science, and make our system of government, and our political and judicial systems more effective.i thank everyone who took part in these open debates on the new political strategy: those who share my views, and those who propose different solutions.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"we all have at least one thing in common: we know that change is essential and that what kind of country we will hand down to our children and grandchildren, and what place it will hold in tomorrow’s world depend on us alone.many of your ideas were taken into account during the work on the presidential address, the work on its proposals, which offer the blueprint for russia’s consistent and systemic modernisation.colleagues,the need for change has become especially clear over these past months.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"the global financial crisis has affected everyone, but russia has experienced an even severer economic downturn than most countries.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"we should not lay the blame on the outside world alone, however.we need to recognise that we have not done enough over these last years to resolve the problems we inherited from the past.",PAFA
Russia,2009,we have not freed ourselves from a primitive economic structure and humiliating dependence on raw materials.,PAFA
Russia,2009,we have not refocused our industry on consumers’ real needs.,PAFA
Russia,2009,the habit of living off export earnings is still holding back innovative development.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"russian business still prefers to sell goods produced abroad, and our own goods’ competitiveness is disgracefully low.the crisis has certainly made it harder to resolve these problems.",PAFA
Russia,2009,it has forced us to concentrate our efforts on dealing with its negative impact by drawing on the substantial reserves that we had built up with such hard work.,PAFA
Russia,2009,the large-scale package of anti-crisis measures made it possible to stabilise the situation by the middle of this year.our priority was and is to support people in difficult circumstances.,PAFA
Russia,2009,budget revenue has fallen but the authorities will continue to carry out social commitments in full.,PAFA
Russia,2009,this will be the case in the future too.this concerns pensions above all.,PAFA
Russia,2009,pensions were indexed on a greater scale than had been planned.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"over the next three years, the average pension will increase at least 1.5-fold, and in 2010, all pensioners will receive an income not lower than the subsistence minimum.",PAFA
Russia,2009,you know how important this is for our elderly people.one of the key tasks that we simply must resolve is that of providing war veterans with housing.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"the federal budget allocates around 46 billion rubles this year for this purpose, and this will make it possible to provide more than 34,000 veterans with better housing conditions.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"i have issued an additional instruction to earmark funds for providing all veterans with apartments, regardless of when they made their requests for better housing conditions.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"this is our duty.the maximum unemployment benefit has been increased more than 1.5-fold, and we are carrying out large-scale job support programmes.",PAFA
Russia,2009,around 2 million people have already taken part in these programmes.,PAFA
Russia,2009,this helps us to prevent a sharp rise in the number of unemployed.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"we will continue to promote job support and job creation programmes, especially for the more than 1 million people around the country who are at risk of being laid off.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"we need to pay more attention to modern professional training, organisation of public works, creating both temporary and permanent jobs, and providing targeted support for people, including for relocation or opening their own businesses.one particularly important area for our efforts is normalising the situation in single-industry towns.",PAFA
Russia,2009,there are several hundred such towns and cities in russia.,PAFA
Russia,2009,they are home to more than 16 million people and produce a large volume of goods and services.,PAFA
Russia,2009,over the coming months we need to take urgent measures to prevent a serious fall in living standards in these towns.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"this is a task for the authorities at all levels, and for the company managers in these towns.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"over the next 6 months the government will approve a programme for supporting these towns’ development, and will adopt comprehensive programmes for the towns and settlements in most difficult circumstances.",PAFA
Russia,2009,in these locations we need to put in place conditions that will enable people to make use of their skills in all different areas and create incentives for private investment.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"if for whatever reason the economic prospects are very slim or are absent altogether we need to help people move to places where they will have better prospects for life and employment, all the more so as we have plenty of regions in need of additional labour.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"i think that many people will be able to find new jobs on their own, but at the same time, i expect the local and regional authorities and the employers to take a responsible and attentive attitude towards specific people’s needs.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"the federal authorities also have to organise the necessary support.we have been providing direct support during the crisis, direct subsidies to russian companies, and this money comes to more than 1 trillion rubles now.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"in the future, we will provide such support only to businesses that have clear plans for raising effectiveness and carrying out high-technology projects.",PAFA
Russia,2009,ineffective companies either have to go through a financial cleanup procedure or leave the market.,PAFA
Russia,2009,protecting them by setting up high trade barriers cannot continue forever.,PAFA
Russia,2009,production can develop only when we have real competition.,PAFA
Russia,2009,russian consumers need to have access to inexpensive quality goods.,PAFA
Russia,2009,the task for russian companies is to learn how to produce them.i note in particular the successful implementation of the state programme for agriculture sector development.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"as a result, agriculture is showing higher growth than any other sector, even during the crisis period.",PAFA
Russia,2009,we will continue our rural support policy.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"we have all the right conditions for making agriculture one of our economic growth leaders for the years to come, and this in turn will improve the quality of life in the countryside.of course, the best anti-crisis policy is to encourage private demand.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"some steps have been taken in this direction, but this is still not enough.",PAFA
Russia,2009,i instruct the government to draft additional measures for supporting consumer loans and expanding housing construction.there have been many proposals for increasing investment in infrastructure.,PAFA
Russia,2009,this is understandable.,PAFA
Russia,2009,infrastructure in our country suffers from a lack of financing.,PAFA
Russia,2009,but so long as basic order has not been brought to this sector and construction is carried out using vastly exaggerated cost estimates i think that spending more money on these projects would be a luxury we cannot afford.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"i instruct the government starting next year to introduce new procedures for tenders in this sector, including using electronic technology, and to bring the technology and costs of building roads and other infrastructure sites into line with world standards.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"we should examine the possibility of using the relevant european union norms in order to draft more rapidly our own construction regulations, because this is something that has been dragging on for too long here.we have paid a lot of attention to supporting the financial system over these last months.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"the banking system is in a satisfactory condition today, taking the crisis year into account of course.",PAFA
Russia,2009,lending is starting to grow again and the amount of overdue debt has stabilised.,PAFA
Russia,2009,now that inflation has come down and the currency market has stabilised interest rates are also gradually starting to fall.,PAFA
Russia,2009,the central bank is now playing in full its part as lender of last resort.,PAFA
Russia,2009,but from the innovative development point of view the financial sector is still weak.,PAFA
Russia,2009,it has insufficient capitalization and is not able to provide a full range of needed services to our people and companies.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"the government should present a programme of specific measures for improving the financial system and making it able to meet the demands of our economy’s modernisation.i think that overall, the government, the central bank, and the regional authorities, with the support of legislators at all levels, have succeeded in stabilising the situation in the economy and social sphere.but i hope that everyone here realises that this revival on the markets is still very weak and unstable.",PAFA
Russia,2009,the most dangerous thing now would be to start telling ourselves that all is well.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"we need to continue carrying out our anti-crisis programme and be ready to act fast to take additional measures.deputies and members of the federation council,we have a duty to heed the lessons of recent events.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"so long as oil prices were growing many, almost all of us, to be honest, fell for the illusion that structural reforms could wait and that what was important now was to make maximum use of the high prices.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"the priority was on pushing ahead the old raw materials economy, while developing unique technology and innovative products was the subject of only random individual decisions.but we can delay no longer.",PAFA
Russia,2009,we must begin the modernisation and technological upgrading of our entire industrial sector.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"i see this as a question of our country’s survival in the modern world.i hope the time is not far off when russia’s prosperity will depend on our successes in developing a market for ideas, inventions and discoveries, and on the ability of our state and society to find and encourage talented individuals capable of critical thinking, and rear young people in a spirit of intellectual freedom and civic activeness.what are the main factors in this development, as i see them?",PAFA
Russia,2009,"the russian economy must make people’s real needs its focus, and people’s needs today are primarily about ensuring their safety, improving their health, and guaranteeing access to energy and information.",PAFA
Russia,2009,this determines our priorities for economic modernisation and technological development.,PAFA
Russia,2009,these are the key tasks for placing russia on a new technological level and making it a global leader.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"these priorities include introducing the latest medical, energy and information technology, developing space and telecommunications systems, and radically increasing energy efficiency.a special presidential commission has approved specific projects in all of these five areas and has drawn up detailed timetables for their implementation.",PAFA
Russia,2009,work is already underway on their practical implementation.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"i hope for the active participation of all the state organisations, the business, scientific and expert communities.i will go into a little more detail on each of these main modernisation areas because i think them vitally essential for our country.the modernisation area of top importance for our people is developing medical technology, medical equipment, and the pharmaceuticals industry.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"we will provide people with quality and affordable medicines and also the latest technology for preventing and treating diseases, especially the diseases that are the biggest causes of sickness and death in our country.",PAFA
Russia,2009,there is no need to say just how significant this is given the demographic situation russia faces.we have already drawn up a list of strategically important medicines that should be produced here in russia.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"this includes the most expensive medicines, in particular medicines for treating cardiovascular diseases and cancer.",PAFA
Russia,2009,we will need to produce more than 50 such medicines so that everyone who needs them will be able to receive timely treatment.,PAFA
Russia,2009,also we will soon dramatically increase production of our own medicines for treating the most common diseases such as colds and flu.i think that russian companies have the ability to produce medicines and technology that would find demand on the global market.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"for this we need to work more actively on developing partnerships with leading foreign developers and producers, who can contribute to organising advanced medical research in russia itself.we will also use the public procurement mechanism to encourage domestic production of medicines and technology.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"within five years, russian-made medicines should account for at least a quarter of the medicines market here and for more than half of the market by 2020.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"this is our goal.i have also given the instruction to prepare and submit to the state duma a draft law setting out regulations for medicines’ supply and sale and, extremely important, their safety demands.",PAFA
Russia,2009,we have a duty to protect people from fake and counterfeit products on this market.along with the introduction of new prevention and treatment procedures we also need to pay particular attention to motivating and giving people the conditions to pursue a healthy lifestyle.,PAFA
Russia,2009,i received a lot of feedback to my article and these words were on precisely this issue: “the measure of personal success should be a person’s health rather than the amount of money earned.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"getting young people into the habit of playing sport would help resolve serious problems such as drug addiction, alcoholism and lack of adult supervision.”",PAFA
Russia,2009,"it is hard to argue with these words.i note that in august this year, russia registered its natural population increase for the first time in the last 15 years.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"this growth is still only small – just 1,000 people – but still, it is an increase nonetheless.",PAFA
Russia,2009,this result was achieved above all thanks to the national project on health and the new demographic policy we have been implementing.,PAFA
Russia,2009,we will continue our efforts in these areas.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"we have every chance of ensuring that our population grows rather than declines.of course, we also need to think about the natural resources that we can preserve and pass on to future generations.",PAFA
Russia,2009,this is why i think that increasing energy efficiency and making the transition to a rational resource consumption model is another of our economy’s modernisation priorities.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"we can resolve this task only if each of us reflects on our personal responsibility for energy saving, as people are now doing throughout the globe.",PAFA
Russia,2009,this is something everyone is thinking about elsewhere in the world.what needs to be done?,PAFA
Russia,2009,"first, we will launch programmes to produce and install individual meters.",PAFA
Russia,2009,people in our cities and towns today are essentially paying for worn-out and therefore costly utilities infrastructure.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"people should pay only for what they actually consume.second, we are beginning a transition to energy-saving light bulbs.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"people will save a considerable amount of money by replacing old equipment.third, starting next year, we will begin carrying out projects to make city districts more energy efficient.",PAFA
Russia,2009,utilities networks will be modernised and a system of payments for services will be introduced that takes more into consideration families’ consumption and income levels.,PAFA
Russia,2009,we will introduce energy service contracts that will make substantial savings possible.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"the energy efficiency programmes will be implemented first of all in the public sector, where there is plenty of work to do.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"i call on all of the country’s regions to take part in these projects.fourth, we need to increase production not only of minerals, but also become a leader in developing innovation both in traditional and alternative energy.one of the most glaring examples of ineffective energy resource use is the flaring of gas extracted alongside oil.",PAFA
Russia,2009,this pollutes the environment and sends tens of billions of rubles up in smoke.,PAFA
Russia,2009,the government has discussed the issue on many occasions and has promised to put an end to this disgrace.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"we really do need to take fast and decisive action, and no objections from the production companies should be accepted.",PAFA
Russia,2009,this has become a popular issue.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"during the meeting i held with the federation council, nikolai ryzhkov asked me to look into the problem of wasting the gas extracted alongside oil.",PAFA
Russia,2009,i don’t know if he is present now or not.,PAFA
Russia,2009,he is here.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"i hope that we can work together then to oversee that this task is fulfilled.one of the most promising areas is to make use of the widespread bio-resources we have, above all timber, peat, and industrial waste, as energy sources.our scientific research and production organisations will focus on developing innovative technology such as developments based on superconductor technology that is particularly relevant for our extensive territory.",PAFA
Russia,2009,we continue to lose huge amounts of energy during its transmission around our country.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"superconductor technology will radically change electricity production, transmission and use.programmes for developing nuclear energy have been made a separate area within the modernisation project.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"by 2014, we will have new-generation reactors and nuclear fuel, for which there will be demand not just in russia but on foreign markets as well.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"developments in the nuclear field will be actively applied in other areas too (above all in medicine, of course), for production of hydrogen fuel, and also for creating propellant devices capable of ensuring space flights even to other planets.we will play an active part in the international project for developing thermonuclear fusion as the future lies with these technologies.",PAFA
Russia,2009,as one of the ‘elite club’ of countries developing nuclear technology we will work together with our foreign partners to open access to what is a practically unlimited energy source.the fourth strategic direction is developing space technology and telecommunications.,PAFA
Russia,2009,our country was traditionally one of the leaders in these sectors but today is only in 63rd place in the world for its level of communications infrastructure development.,PAFA
Russia,2009,this is very bad.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"obviously, without change in this area we will not be able to progress, and this is why we need to give people throughout the entire country broadband internet access over the next five years, and carry out the transition to digital television and fourth-generation mobile phone communications.the national infrastructure network should guarantee access to modern telecommunications in any corner of the country and at reasonable prices.",PAFA
Russia,2009,prices for these services should be lower for people in siberia and the far east.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"priority should go to the services that most of our country’s people really need, above all communication with the unified emergency service and help in emergency situations.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"this is vitally important.high-speed optic cables will be laid across the country, highly productive equipment will be installed, and the considerable number of existing lines will see their potential put to full use.",PAFA
Russia,2009,this will make it possible to guarantee the exchange of ever increasing information flows between the country’s regions and between different countries.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"russia, which extends across 11 time zones, is set to become a key link in the global information infrastructure.incidentally, on the subject of time zones, it has been the custom here to take pride in their number, which seemed to us a vivid symbol of our country’s greatness.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"this is indeed the case, but have we ever stopped to think seriously about whether dividing our country this way makes it harder to manage it effectively and leads to the use of excessively costly technology?",PAFA
Russia,2009,other countries’ examples (the usa and china) show that fewer time zones can work perfectly well.,PAFA
Russia,2009,these are both large countries.,PAFA
Russia,2009,we should examine the possibility of reducing the number of time zones.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"of course, we would need to look into all the possible consequences of such a decision.",PAFA
Russia,2009,this also concerns the expediency of daylight saving.,PAFA
Russia,2009,here too we need to compare the savings made and the inconveniences the practice causes.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"whatever the case, we need to make this analysis.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"i hope that the specialists will give us objective responses, and i stress the word objective, to these questions.another of our priorities will be the use of space technology, including the glonass system, of course.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"this technology will give our people the possibility of using modern navigation systems in their cars, help to guarantee transport safety and security at technically complex facilities, improve coordination between accident prevention, emergency situations and natural and man-induced disasters relief.",PAFA
Russia,2009,it will also give rise to new technology for providing highly accurate digital cartographic information.the introduction of modern engineering solutions and development of new-generation spacecraft will enable us by 2015 to reach world standards in the capacity and service life of the telecommunications satellites we put into orbit.,PAFA
Russia,2009,not all is so good in this area at the moment.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"these new satellites’ technological capacities should enable us to see the whole world and help people in all countries carry out scientific research and work and communicate more effectively with each other.finally, our fifth priority is to develop strategic and information technology.",PAFA
Russia,2009,russia needs to make full use of the potential of supercomputers and supercomputer systems linked by high-speed data exchange channels.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"with their help within five years we could start designing new planes and spacecraft, cars and nuclear reactors.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"sophisticated technology that has not gone through supercomputer simulation and not been digitalised, so to speak, will find itself without demand on the market within a few years.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"if we want to be competitive in this area we have to start working hard.furthermore, starting next year, various state services will be accessible via electronic communications channels too.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"this concerns, in particular, qualification exams and issuing driver’s licences, registering real estate on the cadastre register, and receiving bibliographical information from state libraries and archives.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"in two years time, more than 60 key state services will be available in electronic form.",PAFA
Russia,2009,this is our objective.a pilot project will begin on introducing social cards for people.,PAFA
Russia,2009,such cards will ensure easy access to state services and facilitate participation in medical and social insurance programmes.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"in the future, these cards could be combined with electronic cards giving access to banking products, including making obligatory and voluntary payments.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"implementation of electronic technology will be convenient for people and will also be a powerful tool in preventing corruption.one of the responses i received to my article [go, russia!]",PAFA
Russia,2009,"which came from the town of serpukhov noted that the introduction of this sort of technology, in particular the electronic government, will do a lot to reduce the corruption problem, free people from queuing, and save them time and money.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"this is clearly the case.the five strategic directions for technological modernisation that i have named are certainly all priorities, but the list of state tasks does not end here.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"the government must take active steps to implement development programmes in other economic sectors too, focusing particularly on increasing added value of goods produced in the country.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"this is a key task.i will name several systemic steps we need to take as part of implementation of this general strategy.first, we need to modernise the state owned industries.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"the public sector share in the economy has never gone below 40 percent, and during the crisis the state has seen its role increase, of course.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"this trend has been seen around the world, but from the long-term point of view there is nothing good in this.we need to understand what kind of state sector structure best suits our strategic goals.",PAFA
Russia,2009,i am instructing the government to draw up resolutions for optimising the extent and effectiveness of the state’s participation in businesses’ operation.,PAFA
Russia,2009,this concerns the future of a number of assets that have strategic status at the moment.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"by 2012, we need to accomplish the relevant programme and bring our state sector into line with the optimum parameters set for some foreseeable future, as nothing lasts forever.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"i stress that this is something we need to undertake very carefully so as not to waste assets that belong to our entire nation.but it would be senseless too to hold onto a huge amount of assets with no hope of modernising them.regarding state corporations, i think that this legal form of enterprise has no future overall in the modern world.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"the corporations with a lifetime set by law should wind up once their purposes are accomplished, and those operating in a competitive business environment, should be eventually transformed into joint stock companies under government control.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"in the future, they should either remain in the public sector in cases where necessary, or should be sold to private investors.we also need to carry out an independent audit of [state] corporations and of large companies with state participation, introduce modern corporate governance models in them, and peg the pay of their managers directly to performance results in cost-cutting, energy efficiency, raising labour productivity and introduction of new technology and innovation.optimising budget spending is a constant priority for the executive authorities.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"the government needs to develop and introduce a system of measures creating long-term incentives for raising the quality of state services and ensuring responsibility for effectively spending budget money and producing more efficient results in general.it is absolutely unacceptable that russian taxpayers should have to pay more for this or that service than people in the leading developed countries.second, we will establish a comfortable environment in russia for world-class research and development.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"french scientist louis pasteur hit the nail on the head when he said that, “science should become the country’s highest incarnation, because among all the world’s nations, whichever people is ahead of the others in thinking and intellectual activity will always be the leader.”",PAFA
Russia,2009,"these are fine words.our country has always had an abundance of innovative, progressive and talented people.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"they are the pillar holding up the innovative world, and we need to do everything we can to make these specialists want to work here in their own country.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"this requires us to establish effective mechanisms for supporting them, and also for attracting to russia russian and foreign scientists of repute, and entrepreneurs with experience in commercialising new developments.",PAFA
Russia,2009,this is a complex business.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"we should simplify the rules for recognising degrees and diplomas awarded by the world’s leading universities, and also the rules for hiring the foreign specialists we need.",PAFA
Russia,2009,such people should receive their visas swiftly and for a long period.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"it is we who have an interest in bringing them to russia rather than the other way round.incidentally, many of the people commenting on my article said these same things, noting that our compatriots, russian scientists working abroad, could form an important part of the expert community and help to organise international expert evaluation of russian scientific projects, and if we offer the right conditions, could simply return here to work.i am instructing the government to expand the system of grants on the basis of tenders for those developing new technology.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"development institutes should search for and select promising projects from all around the country and provide financial support for innovative enterprises, including the small innovative businesses that the law now allows universities and scientific establishments to set up.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"of course, they should share the risks in these ventures with private investors.this is something our people are also talking about.",PAFA
Russia,2009,i will voice an idea that was sent in from the republic of altai and proposes that modern universities set up business incubators.,PAFA
Russia,2009,these sorts of ideas have been suggested in the past too.,PAFA
Russia,2009,such university-based business incubators would give graduates the chance to learn how to turn their scientific ideas into profitable business projects.,PAFA
Russia,2009,i think this kind of idea deserves our full support.i stress that not only the state but also our major companies should play their part by placing advance orders for the results of the research carried out.,PAFA
Russia,2009,you could say this is all part of their social responsibility.,PAFA
Russia,2009,a large share of projects should go through an international expert evaluation and be carried out in partnership with foreign centres and companies.the deadline for the government to make all the organisational and financial decisions needed to accomplish these tasks is the first quarter of next year.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"i bring it to your attention that itemised allocation of state funds for these purposes should primarily reflect the technological development priorities we have set.finally, we need to complete preparation work on the programme for establishing a prominent research and development centre in russia to focus on support for absolutely all of the priority areas.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"this is a project to create a modern technological centre, something on the lines of silicon valley and similar foreign centres.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"it would offer attractive working conditions for leading researchers, engineers, designers, software programmers, managers and financial specialists, and it would produce new technology able to compete on the global market.the third systemic step that we need to take is to change our laws and public administration system in such a way as to put our entire economy on an innovative development track.we have said on many occasions that procedures for investment in russia should be as convenient as those of our competitors, and the control and supervision, including the products certification mechanisms, should not create extra barriers for investors ready to put their money into innovative solutions.i am giving the government a two-month deadline to draw up proposals on introducing new procedures for obtaining the approvals and permits needed to launch investment projects.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"this work should make it possible to get projects underway more rapidly, within a fraction of the currently required time.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"if we take this step, it should take no more than 3 to 4 months to complete the whole approval process for sites not classified as ‘hazardous’.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"at the moment, it takes 18 to 24 months, and in big cities the approval process can often drag on for years.the regional authorities should have the power and responsibility for coordinating this work.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"officials who systematically delay the approvals process and demand payments other than those explicitly stipulated by the laws should face administrative and other penalties and, if necessary, be fired.fourth, our tax system and also our laws on mandatory insurance contributions should be adapted to our modernisation demands.in the first quarter of next year, the government will present draft laws on establishing favourable conditions for innovative activity, including, but not limited to, the introduction of a five-year favourable transition period regarding the increase of mandatory social insurance contributions.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"we need to define very clearly at the same time who will be entitled to preferences.overall, our tax system clearly needs improving.",PAFA
Russia,2009,the discussion on what taxes and what rates we should pay is not closed.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"of course, the crisis has hindered decisions on reducing the tax burden, but we will soon need to come back to these issues, and we will most certainly do so.colleagues,it is clear that we cannot carry out our strategic plans without real change in society.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"only if we strengthen our political system and legal institutions, our country’s internal and external security, consolidate our social stability and develop modern education and culture, the culture in the broadest sense of the word, will we be able to achieve success.through our joint efforts, not only will our living standards show real improvement but we ourselves will change too.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"we need to overcome the widespread view that responsibility for sorting out all problems lies with the state or with whoever else, but not with each of us personally.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"personal success, encouragement of initiative, a better quality of public discussion, and zero tolerance of corruption should become part of our national culture, an intrinsic part of who we are.achieving these goals requires us to start at the beginning – by educating new individuals right from the school classroom.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"as prominent economist vasily leontiev said, “education fulfils one of humanity's most basic needs and is a social investment that generates future material production growth.",PAFA
Russia,2009,it raises the present generation’s living standards and at the same time helps to raise the income of future generations.”,PAFA
Russia,2009,"in my address last year, i presented the proposal and gave the instruction to draft an initiative – our new school.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"this has been done, and i will set out this initiative’s basic proposals now.the modern school’s main aim is to develop each pupil’s potential and help form them as individuals ready to take their place in a high-technology and competitive world.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"the discussions on my article produced a huge number of comments on school education, a lot of people write about this subject because it is something that concerns us all.",PAFA
Russia,2009,what people are saying is that school education should teach children to independently set and achieve serious objectives and be able to react to all kinds of different circumstances in life.,PAFA
Russia,2009,what is this initiative’s essence and what immediate steps will it involve?,PAFA
Russia,2009,"i remind you that we have declared 2010 year of the teacher, and first of all, we plan to draft and introduce new education standards and consequently expand the list of documents evaluating and attesting to each pupil’s success.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"the final national school exam will be the basic document in this respect, but will not be the only means of verifying the quality of education.furthermore, we will introduce monitoring and comprehensive evaluation of students’ academic achievements, skills and abilities.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"we need to pay particular attention to students in the senior classes, where the curriculum should be tied directly to the choice of fields in which to specialise at the universities.second, schools should become creative and information centres offering a rich intellectual and sporting life.",PAFA
Russia,2009,an architecture tender will be held for selecting new design projects for building and reconstructing schools.,PAFA
Russia,2009,this should have been done long ago.,PAFA
Russia,2009,the new projects will go into use around the country starting from 2011.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"the task is to build ‘smart’ buildings, modern buildings, in other words, offering all the technology needed for pupils to learn, build up their health, and enjoy good-quality decent hot meals.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"all schools should have access not to ordinary but to broadband internet.starting next year, we will introduce new standards for physical education classes – at least three hours a week, taking into account children’s specific personal circumstances in all cases.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"in general, in all areas we need to take into account children’s individual circumstances and modern scientific knowledge about children.one particular objective is to create a barrier-free school environment for children with disabilities.",PAFA
Russia,2009,a five-year state programme – open environment – aimed at resolving these problems will be adopted in 2010.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"the third thing we must do is give our schools more independence, both in elaborating individual educational programmes and in spending funds.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"starting next year, schools that do well in the competition within the national project, education, will be granted independence and they will become autonomous institutions.",PAFA
Russia,2009,mandatory reporting for such schools will be drastically reduced in exchange for their making available the information on the results.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"headmasters of such schools will sign contracts that will provide for special contractual working conditions based on the performance results.fourth, we need legislation to make public and private education more equal in the legal sense, to give families bigger choice of schools and give students access to the best teachers through distance learning and supplementary education.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"this is especially important for ungraded and remote schools, those in russia's outlying districts.fifth, we have to undertake a complete overhaul of the teacher training system.",PAFA
Russia,2009,we will be introducing mandatory refresher courses and advanced training using the best russian universities and schools as the basis.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"funds for professional development should allow ro choose among a range of educational programmes, and teacher training institutes should be gradually transformed either into major basic centres for training teachers or into faculties of education at universities.",PAFA
Russia,2009,we will seek to invite those who are able to provide a better quality of specialised education for senior students to teach in our schools.,PAFA
Russia,2009,this will include skilled professionals who have no formal teacher education.,PAFA
Russia,2009,those who choose to work in schools will be able to take short-term specialised courses.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"at the same time we will introduce a special system of incentives and new mandatory certification requirements for teachers.i am counting on this initiative (our new school) to be more than just another administrative project, of which we have many, but rather a programme to which our whole society will dedicate itself.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"this is something that we all need.along with the family, the school is the basic social institution, which shapes individuals, inculcates the national and global cultural values in the younger generation, and nurtures civilised citizens.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"and an innovation economy can emerge only in a specific social context as part of an innovative culture based on humanistic ideals, creative freedom, and a desire to improve the quality of life.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"enshrined in our national culture, this ethos determines the successful development of the individual and the nation as a whole.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"for this reason we are devoting considerable attention to the development of culture and extending work in this regard on several fronts.first, we must do everything we can to support the creation of infrastructure needed for normal cultural development, particularly in russia's regions, in its provinces.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"in small cities, towns, villages, those places lacking in modern cinemas, large libraries, theatres and exhibition centres, we need to actively promote information technology.",PAFA
Russia,2009,this must be the basis for cultural modernisation.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"new technology will provide access to culture for millions of our fellow citizens and, most importantly, for our young people.we also need to take a closer look at the special emphasis, after-day-programme educational institutions in the provinces.",PAFA
Russia,2009,they are in a difficult situation.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"we must provide basic education in music and dancing, teach the fundamentals of drawing and painting, and make theatre accessible to all children, in whatever remote corners of the country they live.second, we need to work hard to protect the uniqueness of our country's culture in all its diversity, to help preserve the rich ethnic traditions of russia's peoples, and at the same time develop and improve russian language programmes, which serve as the basis for communication and unity in our country.in one of my meetings with teachers they rightly pointed out: “it’s time that we stop getting caught in minor details and start to deal with our country’s real problems, and we have plenty of those.”",PAFA
Russia,2009,"third, we must take great care to support innovative and experimental trends in the arts.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"in addition to preserving our traditions and protecting our extraordinarily rich cultural legacy, the government should encourage those who are exploring new paths in their creative work.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"it should be borne in mind that what we call the classics today was often created by those who flouted the canon, through the rejection of conventional forms and breaking with tradition.",PAFA
Russia,2009,this spirit of innovation should be encouraged in all spheres of our cultural life.it is the government's job to create the necessary environment for the development of civil society.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"people who are not indifferent to what is happening around them should benefit from every opportunity to realise their noble aspirations.we will continue to support non-profit, charitable organisations that help resolve complex social problems.",PAFA
Russia,2009,corresponding amendments to legislation will be designed to simplify the operation of non-profit organisations that are engaged in charity work and help vulnerable social groups.what will be done in this respect?,PAFA
Russia,2009,"first, we will introduce the concept of socially oriented non-profit organisations.",PAFA
Russia,2009,those who receive this status will be able to count on the government's direct support.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"the authorities will be able to provide such non-profit organisations with financial, information and consulting support.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"but this is not all: what is no less important, they will receive tax incentives and governmental and municipal orders.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"it will be possible to transfer property to non-profit organisations for them to use in their work.we intend to eliminate any tax on the material assistance provided by charitable and non-profit organisations to children without parental support, as well as to the disabled.there is another suggestion.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"services rendered by non-profit organisations in caring for the sick, the disabled, the elderly, and social services for orphans and children without parental support, will be exempt from vat.neither will any income tax be taken from grant-supported projects such as health programmes, promotion of popular sports and physical education.another change in legislation that we have been talking about for years now concerns the creation and replenishment of special-purpose capital of non-profit organisations.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"this will become possible through donations of securities and fixed property (this conversation has been going on for some years now), and environmental protection will now be on the list of activities for which special-purpose capital can be used.third, we will finalise and adopt rules governing charitable activities.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"in particular, their objectives will include: the social rehabilitation of orphans and children without parental support, providing legal assistance, promoting scientific and technical creativity of children and youth, philanthropy and volunteering.fourth, the term “donation” laid down in the civil code should be supplemented to indicate that works or services can be performed or rendered free of charge.all these measures will support those who are already engaged in socially useful work as well as, i hope, attract more people.",PAFA
Russia,2009,along with this there should not be any loopholes that allow one to skulk behind such activities for tax evasion purposes – this is also obvious.,PAFA
Russia,2009,i repeat: we will support only those who selflessly devote their time and effort to others.the growth of civic consciousness and development of civil society is only possible in a developed political system.today we are talking about modernisation – this is the essential aspect of my address today – about our desire to be modern.,PAFA
Russia,2009,we must remember of course that modernity is a fluid notion.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"it is not a final stage of progress at which point you can rest and relax, as we say – quite the contrary.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"a truly modern society is the one that seeks constant renewal, continuous evolutionary transformation of social practices, democratic institutions, visions of the future, assessments of the present, the one engaged in gradual but irreversible changes in technological, economic and cultural spheres, the steady improvement of the quality of life.however, changes for the better occur only when there is an opportunity to openly discuss problems that arise, an opportunity for fair competition between ideas on how to resolve such problems, and in places where people appreciate social stability and respect the law and at the same time are willing to assume responsibility for the situation in their own village or town, and realize that only an active position can set the heavy machine that is government bureaucracy in motion.under the constitution the sole source of power in our country is the people.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"in practice, economic, social and foreign policy is developed following complex interactions between various social groups.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"it is the duty of the government, of any democratic government, to take into account the legitimate interests and opinions of all citizens of russia, regardless of their ethnicity, religion, political or other beliefs.",PAFA
Russia,2009,the ability to fulfil this duty is the main criterion for the effectiveness of government.our society's political diversity is defined by the structure of our multi-party system.,PAFA
Russia,2009,today we can say that the multiparty system has evolved throughout the russian federation.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"it has become a stable, functioning, national political institution, the most important tool for ensuring the fundamental rights and freedoms of our people, including their exclusive right to power.the political parties currently operating in our country have passed the test of time.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"as they fought for votes and voters' trust they have become stronger, and become truly popular.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"they have an organisational structure, personnel and intellectual capabilities: all that is necessary for work in a country russia's size.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"their programmes reflect the entire spectrum of society's political views.at the same time, many aspects of political life have been subject to public criticism.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"there have been problems regarding the organisation of elections, low levels of political culture, and a lack of alternative proposals on specific issues of socio-economic development.we must continue to work together to improve the quality of popular representation and create additional conditions for free, fair and civilized competition between parties.already this year, a parliamentary majority supported a number of my legislative initiatives designed to address such problems.",PAFA
Russia,2009,in practice we have reduced the so-called barrier parties must overcome to enter the duma to 5 percent.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"parties now have the right to nominate candidates for regional governors, and have also been given guarantees of equal coverage of their activities in state-owned media.",PAFA
Russia,2009,i would like to thank the federal assembly for supporting these initiatives.what am i proposing today?,PAFA
Russia,2009,in the next phase i propose to focus on strengthening democratic institutions at the regional level.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"following consultations with representatives of non-governmental organisations and political parties i think the following things are necessary:first, we need to introduce a single criterion for establishing the number of deputies in the regional legislatures of the russian federation.",PAFA
Russia,2009,today it is completely arbitrary and it sometimes leads to results that are hard to justify.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"for example, many millions of people in an economic powerhouse like moscow are represented by 35 elected members in the city's duma, whereas the great khural of the republic of tuva [the republic's bicameral legislature], where the economic output of the region is unfortunately much less impressive than it is in moscow and there are 30 times fewer people, has 162 elected members.",PAFA
Russia,2009,there should be a flexible procedure for the gradual alignment of these imbalances.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"representation should be more functional.second, all parties represented in regional parliaments will have the opportunity to form factions.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"everyone should receive guarantees that their representatives will be able to fill in deputy vacancies on a permanent basis and in leadership positions.third, where this has not yet been established, any party that receives more than 5 percent of votes in the regional elections should be guaranteed representation in the regional legislature.fourth, parties not represented in the duma, but with a faction in the regional legislative assembly, should be exempted from having to collect signatures to participate in regional elections in their respective territories.",PAFA
Russia,2009,the same principle can be established for municipal elections.one another thing: i think that in future we should dispense with the idea of collecting signatures as a method of determining whether a party can stand in an election.our laws are already quite exigent when it comes to formation of political parties.,PAFA
Russia,2009,they require the parties to have a minimum number of adherents as expressly set out in the regulations and operate in most regions of the country.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"so additional tests concerning popular support and organisational abilities are not required.fifth, it would be useful for legislatures at all levels to devote at least one meeting per year to hearing and discussing reports and proposals from parties not represented in the legislature.extra-parliamentary parties should also be able to participate on a continuous basis in the activity of the central and regional electoral commissions.sixth, it's time to finally bring some sort of order to early voting in local elections.",PAFA
Russia,2009,laws on the election of the president and state duma deputies strictly limit the time frame for this procedure and clearly define in what cases it can be used.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"using precisely these rules as a basis, we need to make the appropriate adjustments to federal and regional legislation.",PAFA
Russia,2009,i also think we need to examine the use of absentee ballots and to take whatever measures are necessary to prevent electoral abuses and violations in this regard.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"we also need to give all parties equal opportunity concerning the use of municipal buildings for pre-election campaigning.seventh, i recommend that all regions of the federation enact laws to assure equal coverage in the media for parties represented in regional parliaments.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"mechanisms for the implementation of such safeguards must be adapted to the media market in each region, its particular social and cultural characteristics, but this must be done.the legislative assemblies in those regions of the federation where this has not been done can use the state duma as their model, where the most important meetings are broadcast on the internet in real time.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"i propose that the state duma arrange to have all public plenary meetings broadcasted, without exception.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"i think that this experiment will be of interest for the federation council and possibly the constitutional court.eighth, i propose to supplement the statutes and constitutions of russia's regions with articles requiring heads of executive authorities to report to local parliaments on an annual basis, by analogy with russia's own constitution.ninth, this year there has been some inter-party debate as to whether we need to switch over to a system when only those on party lists can run for elections to representative bodies at all levels.",PAFA
Russia,2009,incidentally this idea was expressed by representatives of both the ruling party and the opposition parties.,PAFA
Russia,2009,we have not yet come to a consensus on details.,PAFA
Russia,2009,i am proposing that we go to work on this.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"we need to continue with this discussion, and then i will make my decision.tenth, we will continue and intensify work on technology designed to ensure political competition.",PAFA
Russia,2009,this is a very important thing in the world today.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"during the discussion in the run-up to this address, someone spoke to this issue, a journalist from the stavropol region who sent in the following comment: “the present arrangement of the electoral process is part of russia’s national infrastructure, like its roads, its electricity, its postal service.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"take away this element of national infrastructure, and you end up with a whole layer of a russian citizen’s life being profoundly affected.”",PAFA
Russia,2009,"government plans to promote broadband internet in russia's rural areas will open up new prospects for transparent public debate on any topic, and provide comprehensive information on developments in our country and the world at large.",PAFA
Russia,2009,the introduction of electronic counting and information processing at polling stations will help to combat abuses and violations during election campaigns.,PAFA
Russia,2009,it should also make the electoral system at the regional level more transparent.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"i would like to commission the cabinet, the central election commission and our regional authorities to prepare a programme for accelerating the technological modernisation of the electoral system.as the guarantor of the constitution i will continue to do everything possible to strengthen democratic institutions in our country.",PAFA
Russia,2009,at the same time i would like to emphasise: the consolidation of democracy does not mean weakening the rule of law.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"any attempts to use democratic slogans to destabilise the situation, the government, and to split society will be prevented.",PAFA
Russia,2009,the law is the same for all – for both the ruling party and the opposition.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"and freedom, as we know, entails responsibilities.",PAFA
Russia,2009,i hope this is clear to all in this hall.at the beginning of next year we can discuss these issues at a meeting of russia's state council.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"i am inviting representatives of all political parties to participate in this important endeavour.deputies, members of the federal assembly,in my article i referred to corruption as one of the main obstacles to our development.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"it is clear that the fight against it must be waged on all fronts: from improving legislation, the law enforcement and judicial systems, to inculcating intolerance to all manifestations of this social evil, including domestic ones.in russia we often say that there are few cases in which corrupt officials are prosecuted.",PAFA
Russia,2009,i want to cite a few figures.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"in just six months of this year we have reviewed more than 4,500 cases of corruption convicting 532 officials of government authorities and local self-government bodies, and more than 700 law enforcement officers.",PAFA
Russia,2009,these figures unfortunately show the extent to which corruption has infected our society.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"however, simply incarcerating a few will not resolve the problem.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"but incarcerated they must be.to successfully combat corruption, all spheres of government must become more transparent, including the activities of public authorities, courts and other judicial bodies.",PAFA
Russia,2009,that is the aim of the relevant laws which will come into force next year: the transparency of government and accessibility of information about the activities of the courts.,PAFA
Russia,2009,these laws will also establish a mechanism for posting information on the activities of the courts on the internet.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"the published texts of judicial decisions will allow us to gain a clearer idea of the work done by the courts, problems in legislation and judicial practices.",PAFA
Russia,2009,i am confident that this will contribute to overcoming legal nihilism.we are also planning to establish courts of appeal in courts of general jurisdiction.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"at the first stage which starts on january 1, 2012, this will be done for civil cases.how will such an appeal be different from what the current system allows?",PAFA
Russia,2009,"as everybody knows, an appeals court considers the complaint regarding the court's decision in full: that is, by examining and evaluating both the factual circumstances of the case and its legal implications.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"in this case an appeals court should either confirm the decision of the lower court, or arrive at a new verdict – and this is the fundamental difference – on the merits of the case.such a test of judicial decisions should enhance their legitimacy and validity.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"and it's important to note that this will not drag out the process required for examining such cases.in order to fully support the appeal process, including the second stage for criminal cases (from january 1, 2013), we will need to increase the number of judges and allocate appropriate resources in the federal budget.i want to emphasise that a properly functioning judicial system is possible only when judges have a reasonable caseload.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"the number of judges per thousand people brings us close to european standards, but in russia every judge has several times as many cases as their european colleagues.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"we shouldn't forget this either.the quality of the judicial system largely depends on the law enforcement situation, which is far from ideal.we need to take some very strong measures to cleanse the ranks of police and special services and rid them of the unworthy.",PAFA
Russia,2009,these people should be brought to justice.those who work in these agencies will be obliged to provide information about what they own and what their family members own.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"we must do everything we can to improve discipline, rigorously conduct internal investigations, and strive to make moral and psychological qualities of our staff fit the highest professional standards.at the same time, we must remember that the majority of law enforcement officers are honest people.",PAFA
Russia,2009,they risk their lives every day.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"they are at the front-line of the fight against crime, they protect the foundations of the constitutional order, and we must improve their financial security.",PAFA
Russia,2009,their work must be respected by society as is the case in the rest of the world.let me dwell on another important aspect.,PAFA
Russia,2009,our criminal law and its application need to be brought up to date.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"criminal penalties, both the ones prescribed by the law and those imposed by the courts, should be commensurate with the seriousness of the crime and in this way better protect the interests of society and of the victim.in criminal law we should make greater use of so-called administrative preclusion, that is, prosecute only in the case of repeated administrative offences.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"we must make greater use of fines as punishment for minor offences, minor crimes and non-violent crimes.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"and if fines are impracticable, then offenders should have to work to serve their sentences, and this should be officially registered as a separate type of punishment.by the way, it is a good idea to use such measure of restraint, such sanction as bail.",PAFA
Russia,2009,the amount of bail for certain categories of crimes should be increased.i support the bill currently being considered by the state duma aimed at excluding from criminal responsibility any taxpayer who has fulfilled his or her obligations and paid the appropriate fines and penalties.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"such people should not be subjected to additional checks by law enforcement agencies.now for what i consider to be our most serious, domestic political problem, the situation in the north caucasus.terrorist crimes against government officials, members of the clergy and law enforcement agencies destabilise the situation and prevent normal economic and social development in the region.we will engage in an uncompromising struggle against international terrorism and we will destroy the gunmen.",PAFA
Russia,2009,soldiers and prosecutors going about their work in the north caucasus region will receive special government attention.,PAFA
Russia,2009,presidential orders and cabinet directives will provide them with additional benefits and social support.,PAFA
Russia,2009,and we will continue to pay attention to this.i have already said that the situation in the north caucasus would not be so acute if there was some real socio-economic development.,PAFA
Russia,2009,it is obvious that the source of many problems lies first and foremost in economic backwardness and the fact that the majority of people there lack normal life prospects.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"let us speak frankly: the level of corruption, violence and cronyism in the north caucasus republics is unprecedented.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"therefore, we will give priority attention to resolving the socio-economic problems of our citizens there.this year, two federal target programmes for the development of southern russia and the chechen republic have been allocated over 26 billion rubles.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"by the end of the year the cabinet should adopt another federal programme to support the development of the republic of ingushetia from 2010 to 2016 with funding of at least 32 billion rubles.as you can see, the sums available for the entire north caucasus region are significant.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"however, the effectiveness with which they are spent leaves much to be desired.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"moreover, part of these funds is stolen quite shamelessly by officials.",PAFA
Russia,2009,and this at a time when unemployment and therefore mass poverty in the caucasus has reached alarming levels.this problem is particularly acute in ingushetia where more than half of the economically active population is unemployed.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"and it is also dire in the chechen republic where the figure is more than 30 percent.i would also point out that this region has the highest share of young people in russia, those between 15 and 20 years old.",PAFA
Russia,2009,and for quite obvious reasons it is more difficult for young people to find work.,PAFA
Russia,2009,in the chechen republic the proportion of unemployed young people is more than 40 percent.in some areas of the north caucasus the number of refugees and displaced persons has reached 20 percent of the local population.,PAFA
Russia,2009,and the lack of a permanent job is just one of the many problems that these people face.the conclusion is clear: additional measures are required to successfully address the problems of the region.,PAFA
Russia,2009,we need to develop entrepreneurship and to increase investment.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"up till now we have failed to create favourable investment climate in most of the north caucasus republics, but that situation must change.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"in this regard, i have instructed the cabinet to draw up within six months a list of investment projects that will receive targeted support.such projects can be implemented in energy and construction, tourism and the health resort network, agriculture and small business.",PAFA
Russia,2009,we need to consider the possibility of tax breaks and other financial mechanisms to encourage increased investment.,PAFA
Russia,2009,these will be part of the incentive for entrepreneurs to start business here.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"i also urge anyone who was born and raised in these regions, but for whatever reasons is now working in other parts of the country, to help with the development of their native land.another problem is the system of temporary labour migration.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"experts have already pointed out that one of the factors limiting economic development in the north caucasus is the low quality of education, especially university education.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"in this regard, we must take steps to train and retrain teachers, at both universities and schools.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"i am instructing the authorities to organise internships in major universities in russia and abroad and to use the presidential management training programme for this purpose.finally, i think it's important to develop and implement clear criteria to measure the effectiveness of actions taken by federal authorities to deal with problems in the north caucasus.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"i am asking the cabinet to establish these criteria by january 1, 2010.",PAFA
Russia,2009,and there has to be a single individual who will be personally responsible for the situation in the region.,PAFA
Russia,2009,of course it has to be someone with enough authority to effectively coordinate work in this area.,PAFA
Russia,2009,such a person will be named soon.the north caucasus is a region that has been historically inhabited by people of many ethnicities.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"and today it is especially important that people work systematically in their families and at school, at the local and regional levels, to create good ethnic relations and a mature civil society.",PAFA
Russia,2009,this is especially important when it comes to the education of the younger generation.,PAFA
Russia,2009,i think that young people from different ethnic groups and faiths should have the opportunity for collaborative learning and joint leisure.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"for this reason i support the idea of creating a pan-caucasian youth camp, where young people from different republics can study, touch base and relax together.to finish with this subject, i would like to say that we will do everything possible to improve people's lives in the north caucasus.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"and we will deal with those who hinder us.dear deputies and members of the federation council,next year the transition of russia's armed forces to a qualitatively new level should be complete, and we will have created a modern, efficient and mobile army, trained and equipped to protect us and our allies from any threats.one of the most challenging and fundamental problems is supplying our troops with new systems, new sorts of weapons and military equipment.",PAFA
Russia,2009,there is no need to embark here on some sort of abstract discussion: we simply need to acquire these weapons.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"in the next year we need to provide the armed forces with more than 30 ballistic land- and sea-based missiles, 5 iskander missile systems, about 300 modern armoured vehicles, 30 helicopters, 28 combat aircraft, 3 nuclear-powered submarines, 1 corvette-class battleship and 11 spacecraft.",PAFA
Russia,2009,all this simply has to be done.another important issue is providing the armed forces with modern automated control centres and information systems.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"before 2012 we need to replace outdated analogue communications equipment with digital systems, and give priority in equipping with these modern communications means to the troops of the north caucasus military district.once again i would like to draw your attention to the need for the latest sorts of arms which will ensure our superiority over any enemy.",PAFA
Russia,2009,we must also have an effective system of orders for military goods and maintain a strictly observed balance between the supply of arms for national defence needs and supplies abroad.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"i should stress again that the heads of the defence industry enterprises should substantially improve the quality of their products and reduce their cost.by the end of this year we will have set up military-educational institutions of a new sort, three major military training centres, in moscow, the moscow region and st petersburg.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"they will play a crucial role in training the younger generation of officers, officers who will be not only professionally trained but educated in the values of patriotism, military honour and moral rectitude.as part of the effort to raise the prestige of military service and officers' status in society, we are planning to open seven presidential cadet schools.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"the first one will open next year in the volga federal district, and the others will open over the next three years in other federal districts.the army will gain professional sergeants and highly qualified junior command personnel.",PAFA
Russia,2009,they will assist officers in educating and training soldiers to improve their combat skills.providing servicemen with permanent and service housing remains our priority.,PAFA
Russia,2009,the russian government managed to increase the funds allocated this year for this purpose by more than one-and-a-half times.,PAFA
Russia,2009,the russian ministry of defence and other law enforcement agencies have to uphold their commitments concerning the construction and purchase of apartments.,PAFA
Russia,2009,our goals of providing permanent housing in 2010 and service housing by 2012 must be achieved.before 2012 we should adopt a special law on military pay.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"a new system of payment for military service and material incentives should significantly improve the lives of our soldiers.dear colleagues,our relations with other countries should also be focused on the task of modernising russia.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"we must not simply be full of hot air, as they say.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"we are interested in capital inflows, new technologies and innovative ideas.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"we know that our partners are counting on a rapprochement with russia to realise their own priorities.therefore, our foreign policy must be extremely pragmatic.",PAFA
Russia,2009,its effectiveness should be judged by a simple criterion: does it contribute to improving living standards in our country?,PAFA
Russia,2009,"in my previous address, i spoke at length about our foreign policy priorities, priorities which remain the same today.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"we still advocate stronger multipolarity, a concept which is becoming increasingly widespread throughout the world. 10 years ago, or even five years ago, could we imagine the leaders of so many different countries sitting at one table and discussing financial, economic and in effect domestic issues?",PAFA
Russia,2009,"but that is exactly what happens at g20 summits.it was these processes i had in mind when i wrote in my article that we are already working together to reform the global financial architecture and security system, to modernise them effectively so that they can take into account the interests of an increasing number of countries and establish equitable relations in international politics and economics.of course, this creates new challenges for us all.",PAFA
Russia,2009,we must therefore change our approach and think more about how to engage in teamwork.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"we are ready for this, including with respect to complex issues of international politics, such as the problems of iran and north korea's nuclear programmes, instability in afghanistan, a middle eastern settlement, and naturally other problems as well.we have the universal mechanism of the united nations to help us develop a collective approach.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"in recent years and perhaps for the very first time since the end of the so-called cold war, the united nations has once again started to gain momentum.",PAFA
Russia,2009,and we will actively encourage it to strengthen its position.in the field of security we are now focussing our main efforts on a european security treaty.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"legal, or rather the international legal formalization of the principle of indivisible security in euro-atlantic territory is imperative for us, as is the development of enforcement mechanisms related to this commitment.",PAFA
Russia,2009,we are sometimes accused of having come up with this against nato.,PAFA
Russia,2009,this is not true: we absolutely do not conduct our foreign policy ”against anyone“.,PAFA
Russia,2009,but we are not a member of nato.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"this is true, and several other states are not members of that bloc either, but tough decisions must already be taken in order to strengthen security in europe.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"we need a new, efficient platform.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"if we had such an effective institution that would have been able to halt an aggressor, then georgia would not have had the nerve to start a war against south ossetia.in conclusion i would like to draw attention to the need to increase coordination as we defend russia's interests in foreign policy, economic, cultural and educational spheres.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"diplomatic work in the interests of the country's economy, precisely its economy, must be subject to special checks.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"this work should be conducted not only in the form of specific assistance to russia's companies abroad and efforts to promote national brands of goods and services – though this is very important – but it should also be designed to increase the volume of foreign investments we attract and, most importantly, the influx of new technologies.i am instructing the cabinet to develop clear criteria for assessing the results of foreign policy activities designed to meet challenges associated with modernisation and technological advances.our foreign ministry must review this work on a systematic basis and, depending on its results, prepare a programme for the effective use of foreign policy elements for long-term national development.dear friends,next year we will celebrate the 65th anniversary of victory and honour our veterans – the saviours of our fatherland, heroes who defended our freedom, who lived through the war and raised our country from the ruins.we all consider them to be great people, but they are great not only as actors in a grand historical drama.",PAFA
Russia,2009,for us they are close relatives in the direct and literal sense of the word.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"we share the same blood with those who won and are therefore all descendants of winners, and for that reason i believe in a new russia.",PAFA
Russia,2009,"we must remember and respect our past and work hard for a decent future.we shall overcome underdevelopment and corruption because we are a strong and free people, and deserve a normal life in a modern, prosperous democratic society.we chose our own path.",PAFA
Russia,2009,our fathers and grandfathers won at that time.,PAFA
Russia,2009,"now it’s our turn.go, russia!",PAFA
Russia,2010,"citizens of russia,state duma deputies and members of the federation council,speaking in this room a year ago, i presented my political strategy, which was to modernise our economy and give impetus to progress in all areas, based on democratic values; to raise a generation of free, well-educated and creative people; to raise the living standards of our people to a fundamentally new level; to confirm russia's status as a modern world power whose success is based on innovation.these processes, modernisation in our country, began at a time, which was hard for the whole world, a time of the global crisis.",PAFA
Russia,2010,compounding this were the heat wave and wildfires of last summer.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"yet, despite the difficulties, on the whole we were able to accomplish quite a few things, and i would like to thank all those who contributed to renewing our society.we managed to stabilise our economy after a significant downturn, and this year we expect economic growth of 4%.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"despite the growth of food prices, which regrettably occurred throughout the world, we prevented an inflation upsurge.",PAFA
Russia,2010,our objective for the next three years is to bring it down to 4–5% a year.almost 150 billion rubles were allocated to the agricultural sector in order to mitigate the consequences of the drought.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"our decisions will stabilise the situation in this key industry, help the farmers and prevent a drop in living standards in the affected areas.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"i will continue to personally monitor the implementation of these decisions.the number of the unemployed is now about 5 million people, a reduction of 2 million since the crisis peaked.",PAFA
Russia,2010,this is a significant achievement.,PAFA
Russia,2010,sovereign debt is at a very low level.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"russia's international reserves today amount to about $500 billion, much more than at the end of 2008.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"after the anti-crisis measures, which were unprecedented in scale, we are now moving on to a more balanced budget policy.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"the budget deficit, unfortunately, remains quite high.",PAFA
Russia,2010,we will reduce it lest it becomes an obstacle to development.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"all the leading nations have taken up similar obligations.of course, the economic situation is still quite complex.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"we haven’t overcome all the consequences of the crisis yet, and we must admit this openly.",PAFA
Russia,2010,but we will fulfil our social obligations regardless of anything.the real income of our people has grown by approximately 5% over the last few months.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"next year, we are planning to raise the salaries of public employees.",PAFA
Russia,2010,we are implementing targeted programs to provide housing for war veterans and army personnel.we have been able to raise pensions every year.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"i had set an objective to provide all pensioners with an income of at least the subsistence minimum, and this goal has been achieved.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"yet, the average level of pensions remains quite low, of course.to raise pensions and modernise the healthcare system, we made a number of tough decisions, including raising mandatory medical insurance premiums.",PAFA
Russia,2010,people talk a lot about this today.,PAFA
Russia,2010,we need to find a way to mitigate the negative impact of this measure on businesses.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"in this context, i made the following decision.",PAFA
Russia,2010,small businesses working in manufacturing or providing social services will be given a two-year transition period with a lower premium level set at 26%.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"this year, we focused on the priority areas of technological modernisation.",PAFA
Russia,2010,our goal is to raise our economy’s energy efficiency by 40% by 2020.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"this goal is realistic, and i am absolutely sure we can achieve it.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"this will both reduce corporate expenses and help people save their money, primarily and perhaps most importantly, when they pay utility bills.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"we discussed the issue recently, and the main conclusion we came to was that, in order to prevent further degradation of the utility infrastructure and at the same time enhance energy efficiency, we need to attract private investors to the housing and public utilities sector more actively.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"i have already given all the necessary instructions on this issue.also, i’d like to note that we have certain achievements in the development of high technology.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"for example, russia’s nuclear industry is once again building and launching new power plants every year.",PAFA
Russia,2010,nine reactors are currently under construction in russia.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"in addition, russia is working on projects in india, iran, china and other countries.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"the total volume of atomic industry’s orders for machine-building products has grown tenfold over the past three years, or by 25 times against 2005.",PAFA
Russia,2010,it is a good figure.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"of course, the state budget and all the people employed in the industry benefit from that.to give you another example, today the world’s top 500 supercomputers feature 11 systems made in russia.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"next year the performance of russia’s lomonosov supercomputer will grow by more than 2.5 times, making it one of the most powerful computers in the world.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"the glonass satellite grouping will be complete before the end of this year, and within the next two years all key digital navigation maps will be ready, so our own satellite navigators will be available for use.",PAFA
Russia,2010,the capacities of glonass will serve the mass consumer.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"by next year, most border regions will have digital access to the package that includes all must-carry public tv channels.",PAFA
Russia,2010,we will build over 1000 facilities for the public digital broadcasting system.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"this year, we taught the internet to speak russian, so to say.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"it is important, even in terms of russia’s reputation.",PAFA
Russia,2010,the .рф domain is open and gaining popularity.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"i consider that to be another one of our achievements.in addition, we have started to implement the new strategy for the development of russia’s pharmaceutical industry.",PAFA
Russia,2010,over the next few years the share of russian pharmaceuticals on the domestic market has to be radically increased.,PAFA
Russia,2010,we want to see an increase from 20% to 50% and up to 60% for innovative products.,PAFA
Russia,2010,this will make medicines more accessible.,PAFA
Russia,2010,i hope growth in pharmaceutical exports will become an important item of income for russia.the skolkovo centre remains our most renowned innovation project.,PAFA
Russia,2010,i put forward this idea less than a year ago.,PAFA
Russia,2010,today the project is becoming reality.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"we have the land, the management team and we have laws setting up unique preferences for those who will be involved in the project.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"finally, we have concrete suggestions from private and state-owned companies that are ready to start work on it at any time.i’d like to emphasise that tax exemptions and state funding for research should be made available to anyone who has ideas and meets our eligibility criteria.in addition, we are planning to allocate approximately 30 billion rubles for joint research projects between universities and businesses.",PAFA
Russia,2010,that is a significant sum of money but if the projects are successful i believe the financing should be increased.there is another project that we consider important.,PAFA
Russia,2010,our project to turn moscow into a major international financial centre.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"the responsibility for that project lies on the federal authority, the city administration and the new mayor of moscow.",PAFA
Russia,2010,major financial institutions from russia and abroad are involved in the work.,PAFA
Russia,2010,i am sure we have a chance to succeed in that project.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"the benefits of having an efficient financial market will be evident for the people, for the business, which will be able to take advantage of the whole range of modern financial services, and of course for the whole country which will benefit from an influx of investments and taxable new enterprises.we have, achieved a lot in one year but i hope we all realise that this is only the very beginning.",PAFA
Russia,2010,the resources we possess should be used to modernise our economy rather than to mend holes.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"we have to create new, competitive goods and services and millions of jobs.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"we have to create a demand for innovation, develop our small and medium-sized business and expand the professional and social prospects of our people.i’m instructing the government to direct at least 50 percent of the saved budget funds and part of our extra income towards modernisation projects.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"that includes the much-talked-about rise in the energy efficiency of our economy, the development of new technologies in the energy, it, telecom and medicine sectors.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"the quality of our people’s life depends on our success in these fields.colleagues,everything i was talking about just now, all the modernisation is not a goal in itself.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"it is an instrument, a tool that would allow us to solve economic and social problems that are long overdue.",PAFA
Russia,2010,an instrument we can use to support those who need it most and create the conditions that would help develop the potential of those we pin our hopes on: our youth and our children.,PAFA
Russia,2010,modernisation is carried out for their sake.,PAFA
Russia,2010,we must not be ashamed for the country we pass on to our children and grandchildren but who we pass russia on to is also crucial.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"the 26 million children and teenagers living in russia have to fulfil their potential, grow up to be happy and healthy and become worthy citizens of russia.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"this is our no. 1 priority.taking care of future generations is the most reliable, smart and noble sort of investment we can make.",PAFA
Russia,2010,a society that effectively protects the rights of its children and respects their dignity is not only kinder and more humane.,PAFA
Russia,2010,it develops faster and better.,PAFA
Russia,2010,it has a good and predictable future.i believe it is vitally important for us to introduce an efficient state policy for children.,PAFA
Russia,2010,a modern policy that would correspond with our national development interests.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"this is why today’s address will focus on that subject as i speak about the issues that i believe need to be addressed and resolved in a new way.first, the measures to improve the demographic situation.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"compared to 2005, our birth rate has increased by over 21%.",PAFA
Russia,2010,this is one of the best growth rates in the world.,PAFA
Russia,2010,infant mortality dropped by 25%.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"last year, for the first time in the past 15 years our country saw an increase in population.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"to a large extent, this is the result of the maternity capital programme, the national healthcare project and other family-oriented social support measures.we started tackling the demographic problem seriously and have launched a long-term program.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"but we should understand that the next 15 years will see the effects of the demographic downturn we suffered in the early 1990s, with the number of women of reproductive age decreasing considerably, which poses a serious threat and challenge to the whole of our nation.what should we do about it?",PAFA
Russia,2010,"first, we must enhance both the quality and availability of medical assistance and social benefits to mothers and their children.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"we must further develop the maternity certificate programme, as well as rehabilitation programmes for children under 3 and low-birth-weight infants.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"we must also increase state support of fertility programmes, including in vitro fertilisation.second, we must undertake technological modernisation of children’s hospitals and clinics and to upgrade the skills of medical staff working there.",PAFA
Russia,2010,considerable funds must be allocated for these purposes through co-financing of regional programmes starting already from the next year.,PAFA
Russia,2010,at least 25% of the funds earmarked for healthcare modernisation schemes will go to developing children’s healthcare.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"this is a lot of money; essentially, it can amount to some 100 billion rubles in the next two years.today, almost a third of all children have health problems by the time they reach school age.",PAFA
Russia,2010,teenage statistics are even sadder: two thirds have health deviations.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"starting from 2011, we must monitor more closely their health through extended medical examinations.special attention should be given to vaccination, to making quality medicines available to children and teenagers, to early detection of tuberculosis, oncological and other dangerous diseases.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"funds should be allocated for these purposes, as well.the third point, which is of the utmost importance, is supporting young and large families.",PAFA
Russia,2010,one of the most acute problems is that of housing.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"since 2008, law allows using the maternity capital to pay out mortgages and housing loans under contracts closed before december 31, 2010, which means that this money can be used even before the child turns three.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"almost 250,000 russians have already used this opportunity, while the housing market got extra incentives for development, which is important in the post-crisis period.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"i believe that starting from the next year this should become regular practice.the forth point is that according to the experts, the main way to overcome the demographic crisis is a radical increase in the number of families with three and more children.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"quite recently, while searching the web i’ve come across a piece of interesting information about a social advertising campaign, which took place in the altai territory, if i am not mistaken.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"the idea is simple, but very nice.",PAFA
Russia,2010,people were asked to tell which russian celebrities and distinguished russians were third children in their families.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"among them were nikolai nekrasov, anton chekhov, yuri gagarin, anna akhmatova.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"without these great people, without their creative work and achievements, the world would have been different.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"humanity would have been poorer in terms of morality and culture.therefore, i believe that most favourable conditions must be created for large families.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"in some regions, for instance, in the ivanovo region, as far as i am concerned, a family gets a free land lot to build a house or a dacha when a third child is born.",PAFA
Russia,2010,it’s the right kind of decision and a good example for other regions.i believe that this should become common practice across russia.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"i instruct the government and regional authorities to design a programme of free land allocation for house/dacha construction, when a third and every subsequent child is born.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"this standard may be introduced gradually, with due regard to regional specifics.regions may go for other measures to support large families.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"for example, in the ulyanovsk region young families receive a 100,000-ruble certificate with the birth of a third child and subsequent children.",PAFA
Russia,2010,i suggest that all regional heads should think of introducing regional maternity capital.,PAFA
Russia,2010,this step will definitely require money.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"its implementation depends on the situation in a specific region, but the result is worth it.the fifth point.",PAFA
Russia,2010,we must introduce additional tax benefits for families with three or more minors.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"specifically, tax refund must be increased up to 3,000 rubles per month per child starting with the third child.",PAFA
Russia,2010,i am instructing the government to submit relevant proposals and draft a programme to increase tax refund amounts for every large family while at the same time cancelling standard tax refunds.,PAFA
Russia,2010,for most of our citizens they have become symbolic.,PAFA
Russia,2010,the sixth point.,PAFA
Russia,2010,today many foundations and mass media organise fund-raising for children suffering from severe diseases.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"there are also businessmen, who help orphanages, and support children’s sport and leisure without making a show of it, which is probably most important.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"to support such initiatives, we’ve been trying to improve our legislation on charity activities for several years now.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"however, we still have problems here.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"for example, any repeated charity support for a child, even the one who is seriously ill, is subject to tax.",PAFA
Russia,2010,that’s not fair.funds received from charity organisations to support children must be fully excluded from taxable income.,PAFA
Russia,2010,i expect that the state duma will soon adopt a relevant law.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"judging by the applause, this will be the case.the seventh point.",PAFA
Russia,2010,a highly charged and sensitive matter for young families is that of kindergartens.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"wherever i go, people almost always ask me this question.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"at the beginning of the year, 1,684 million children were in the queue to get a place at a kindergarten.",PAFA
Russia,2010,people actually have to join this queue even before their child is born.,PAFA
Russia,2010,often this is the reason why young families either postpone the birth of a child or choose to limit themselves to one child.my instructions in this respect are as follows.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"firstly, all regions must implement programmes to reconstruct old kindergartens and build new ones that comply with today’s requirements, or to allot buildings to accommodate them.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"these requirements must be reasonable, valid and realistic.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"as i said before, they should not be excessive.secondly, we must promote alternative forms of preschool education, including the system of private preschool facilities and family kindergartens, to consider possible reduction of rental rates and introduction of property tax privileges for new types of kindergartens, including family kindergartens.thirdly, preschool groups in general education schools must be created for children not attending kindergartens.colleagues,for two years now we’ve been presenting the order of parental honour instituted by me.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"among the recipients are fathers and mothers of not only their own children, but also of adopted ones.",PAFA
Russia,2010,we are justifiably proud of such families.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"to be frank, just talking to them when they come here to the kremlin to receive state decorations gives me true joy.sadly, our country still has 130,000 children left without parental care.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"they have neither parents, nor guardians; they are denied of the most important thing – family warmth.",PAFA
Russia,2010,we still have a long way to go to get rid of the ‘abandoned children’ notion.,PAFA
Russia,2010,guardianship authorities must be directly focused on placing those children in families and helping foster families.,PAFA
Russia,2010,there should be no ‘un-adopted’ children in our country.the so-called correctional orphanages remain a serious challenge.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"unfortunately, they work more to isolate children rather than help them socialize.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"therefore, the situation here should be monitored not only by state agencies and services, but by civil society as well.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"we must introduce a board of trustees in every orphanage or correctional institution, and these boards’ work should be transparent as possible.finally, we need social adaptation programmes for those leaving orphanages.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"it’s not enough to just teach and feed them; we have to help them start a new adult life, be ready for it, be self-confident.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"it’s not only teachers, but also local authorities that should play an important role here.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"they could, for instance, cover the expenses for pre-study courses of those leaving orphanages.our policy for children is based on generally accepted international standards.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"declaration of the rights of the child adopted by the un general assembly states that “humanity must give the child the best it has”, while the convention on the rights of the child established that children’s interests have a priority before the interests of society and the state.in 2009, we introduced a new institution – a presidential commissioner for children’s rights.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"the commissioner has a lot to attend to, to put it mildly.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"last summer, for example, several gross violations of safety regulations in summer camps were registered, which resulted in disease outbreaks and even death of children.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"we have to preclude any chance of such things happening again.local administrations and supervisory bodies have to prepare for the next summer season well ahead, which means they should start right now.",PAFA
Russia,2010,child ombudsmen who currently work in 58 regions of russia have to look into the issue as well.,PAFA
Russia,2010,i believe every russian region should have its own commissioner for children’s rights.child abuse is a truly horrible problem.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"official data provided by the interior ministry says that over 100,000 children and teenagers suffered abuse in 2009.",PAFA
Russia,2010,just think about the figure.,PAFA
Russia,2010,some facts really break your heart.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"children, mostly orphans and unprivileged children get involved in drug abuse, prostitution and other criminal activities.",PAFA
Russia,2010,the scoundrels responsible for this should be punished with utmost severity.last year we introduced a harsher punishment for sexual abuse of minors.,PAFA
Russia,2010,preventive measures against that kind of crimes are no less important.,PAFA
Russia,2010,i believe that convicted child abusers or those who drag children into criminal activity should be banned from working in the education sector.,PAFA
Russia,2010,people like that should not be allowed anywhere near children.the respective draft law introducing the amendments to the labour code has been submitted to the state duma.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"i hope it is approved by the end of this year.esteemed deputies and federation council members,protecting the life and health of a child is a direct responsibility of the child’s family and relatives.",PAFA
Russia,2010,that makes domestic violence against children even more horrible.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"as we know, cruelty breeds cruelty.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"children adopt the behaviour model they see in adults and apply it in their lives – in school, in college, in the army and then in their own families.",PAFA
Russia,2010,our society has to adopt an attitude of intolerance towards cruel treatment of children.,PAFA
Russia,2010,we need to expose domestic violence and stop it.,PAFA
Russia,2010,i know that several regions have social aid centres that deal with domestic violence cases.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"the experience we’ve accumulated in st petersburg, the orenburg region and the khanty-mansi autonomous area has to be used in all regions of russia.i have to mention another problem.",PAFA
Russia,2010,our country has practically no infrastructure for people with disabilities and serious diseases.,PAFA
Russia,2010,i don’t need to explain to you how much of a problem that is for children.,PAFA
Russia,2010,even a daily trip to school often becomes a torture for a disabled child.,PAFA
Russia,2010,finding a wheelchair-accessible bus is a real problem.,PAFA
Russia,2010,residential and office buildings are usually just inaccessible to children in wheelchairs.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"although, i have to say that new houses, at least the ones i saw, are being built in accordance with these new standards.at the same time, disabled people often achieve great results in sports and art.",PAFA
Russia,2010,they are truly the glory of russia.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"take, for instance, our paralympics team.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"their success is amazing, though it happens in spite of the circumstances rather than because of systemic measures taken by the state and society.",PAFA
Russia,2010,creating a favourable environment for disabled children should be a priority in our new federal programme on the accessible environment.the job of raising future generations is closely linked with the modernisation of the education system.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"by implementing the our new school initiative, we have redefined our standards for elementary school and prepared new standards for secondary and senior high school.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"also, during year of the teacher, we introduced new qualification requirements for teachers and new procedures for regular professional examinations and re-training.",PAFA
Russia,2010,teachers should also have an opportunity to undergo internships at russia’s best schools and receive additional professional training at the best universities.,PAFA
Russia,2010,we are planning to allocate over 2 billion rubles for those purposes in 2011.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"but regional and municipal authorities should provide their share of financial support.as winston churchill said, “headmasters have powers at their disposal with which prime ministers have never yet been invested.”",PAFA
Russia,2010,those powers should be used today to bring out the potential of every child and prepare children to choose their future professions as well as we can.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"in order to achieve that, we have to pay attention to the following.first, in 2011 each school should create its own “school of the future” project.",PAFA
Russia,2010,it will be a vision of how the school should develop.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"of course, these projects should be devised primarily by teachers, current and former students of the school and parents.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"but i think that regional administrations could work on the implementation procedures for those projects, engaging the business, if necessary.second, we need to complete the creation of a nationwide system that would help locate and support talented children.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"all children should be able to develop their potential regardless of where they live, the incomes of their families or their social status.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"i am instructing the government to take this recommendation into account when new educational standards are introduced and to establish a standard per capita subsidy for educational programmes for gifted children.third, children today are different from what we were at their age.",PAFA
Russia,2010,every generation is different from the previous one.,PAFA
Russia,2010,they feel at home in the world of telecommunications and are used to new ways of information gathering.,PAFA
Russia,2010,they like using new gadgets.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"as it has been said, and rightly so, no one in the world is as sensitive to novelty as children.",PAFA
Russia,2010,using modern software and technological advances in education has to become the norm.,PAFA
Russia,2010,it has to be envisaged in the new standards.the teachers have to learn all about that as well.,PAFA
Russia,2010,we can’t tolerate the situation where students know more about modern technology than teachers.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"teachers have to know about these things.fourth, the upbringing of our children is a responsibility not only of the education system but of our culture and society as a whole.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"we need new, quality films that will be of interest to our children.",PAFA
Russia,2010,let us remember the influence that good science fiction has had on entire generations.,PAFA
Russia,2010,we all read those books.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"they fascinated children, encouraging them to make their own discoveries.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"a whole generation was raised on those books.fifth, we need to pay more attention to the patriotic upbringing of our youth.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"true, we need to make serious changes in this area but some traditional methods such as military games can still be used today.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"they build character, promote teamwork and teach children to overcome difficulties.i would like to specifically note the work of groups that find and identify soldiers’ remains.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"in 2010, the year when we marked 65th anniversary of the victory, they helped a lot of people find out where their loved ones were buried.",PAFA
Russia,2010,this way our young ones are learning true patriotism.i instructed the government to step up efforts to recover the remains of missing soldiers and repair war memorials.,PAFA
Russia,2010,the situation is not altogether positive.,PAFA
Russia,2010,but i believe authorities at all levels should be doing that constantly rather than just in preparation for special events and anniversary years like 2010.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"sixth, promoting the healthy way of life is a strategic priority of our policy for children.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"of course, this applies not only to children.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"we, adults, have to set an example.",PAFA
Russia,2010,our whole society has to get over its childish mindset when it comes to healthy living.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"as leo tolstoy said, you can’t develop children properly unless you develop yourself first.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"yet 80% of russians, or four-fifths of our entire population, don’t exercise or do sports.russia has one of the highest percentages of smokers in the world.",PAFA
Russia,2010,at the same time the age at which young people start drinking and smoking keeps decreasing.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"those who sell alcohol to underage children must remember that this mean sanctions, including criminal prosecution.i hope your applause means the bill currently under consideration in the state duma on penalties for such sales will be approved shortly.",PAFA
Russia,2010,(applause)the health and future success of our nation depends directly on what kind of environment we leave to our children.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"in spite of the fact that russia’s environment is unique and rich, we can hardly say that it is in perfect condition.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"we can only solve that problem by introducing a modern and efficient environment protection system.we urgently need to take the following steps.first, we have to evaluate the real condition of all polluted territories and use this as a starting point for our programs to minimise environmental damage and clean up accumulated pollution.also, some experts believe we need a so-called environmental amnesty, as long as the companies subject to the amnesty take it upon themselves to make their production facilities environment-friendly and clean up the territories where their plants are located.",PAFA
Russia,2010,i think the idea is reasonable.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"the companies which are implementing such programmes – not just preparing them but really implementing them and spending money on them – should not have to pay excessive fines, as it would only make it harder for them to remedy the situation.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"on the contrary, we need to support such programmes and use private-public partnerships as much as possible.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"i am instructing the government to prepare their suggestions on this issue.second, the government should devise environmental standards that would take into account special conditions in some territories.",PAFA
Russia,2010,those would serve as a reference point for the authorities in their decision-making and setting requirements for production facilities.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"in fact, those standards will also serve as a clear benchmark for our people and our foreign partners.third, our civil society needs to play an important role in environment protection.",PAFA
Russia,2010,i often hear that “green” ideas are not popular in russia because our people are not ready for them.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"to some extent, this may be true.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"that is why, as i have mentioned, the role of environmental education is crucial.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"we have to take that into account in our new educational standards.fourth, the quality of the environment should be the most important indicator of the quality of life and one of the main indicators of the territory’s socio-economic development.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"consequently, it should be a criterion to measure the efficiency of local authorities.",PAFA
Russia,2010,i’m instructing the heads of all regions to present annual reports on the environmental situation in their regions.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"the people of those regions should have complete and true information about that.as for non-governmental environmental organisations, if those people genuinely care for the environment, we need to have detailed discussions with them and find mutually acceptable solutions before we start building industrial or infrastructure facilities.in conclusion i would like to say that childhood and youth is a time when people define their future, a time when people try new things.",PAFA
Russia,2010,they discover.,PAFA
Russia,2010,they experiment.,PAFA
Russia,2010,they have no fear.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"the spirit of innovation, the desire to produce something new, bold thinking – those are the things our country needs today.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"we are counting on the energy and ambitions of our young people and their desire to work together and together achieve the goals they set.deputies of the state duma and members of the federation council,modernisation produces a smart economy but it also requires smart policies that create the conditions for an extensive renewal of society.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"we need new standards in governance and public services, a higher quality of courts and law enforcement, modern ways for people to participate in the development of their city or village, and more involvement on the part of the people in the work of municipal authorities.in order to achieve that, i propose we take the following steps.first, we need to make day-to-day interaction between the state and its citizens transparent, clear and simple.",PAFA
Russia,2010,the understanding that government officials serve the people rather than control their lives is the foundation of democracy.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"for citizens, the state is the official to whose office they come with their problems, the judge who makes a ruling in their case, a local police officer or a tax inspector – any person who has the authority to solve their problems, like all of you sitting in this room.",PAFA
Russia,2010,government officials should not discredit the state with their activities.,PAFA
Russia,2010,their main mission is to improve the conditions that people live in.we are optimising our system of state and municipal services.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"even today, people in many regions can file an electronic application for a passport or check their retirement account from home.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"also, they can register a vehicle or get a driver’s license in any traffic authority office, not just the one closest to their registered residence, as long as it’s within their region.thus, some of the new rules are already working, even though i know from the letters i receive that some people are not satisfied with the way the system works.",PAFA
Russia,2010,we need to keep improving it.,PAFA
Russia,2010,the rest of the rules will become effective next year or the one after that.the most important rule is to stick to the “one-stop” principle.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"people should not have to run from one government office to another collecting all sorts of documents, the way parents have to do when they want to get support for their children that they are entitled to by law.government officials should be legally liable if they violate maximum periods for providing public services or if they violate procedures established by relevant administrative regulations.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"i give the government one month to prepare their proposals on these issues.second, while modernising the system of public services, we need to pay special attention to the social services we provide to people.",PAFA
Russia,2010,i think we should involve non-commercial organisations more in providing those services.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"they often know the actual situation even better than the authorities, they have unique experience, and they help people who find themselves in a difficult situation.",PAFA
Russia,2010,i think by involving non-commercial organisations we will make social services more substantive and targeted.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"also, this will reduce corruption among government officials, which is crucial.federal agencies should develop a clear and transparent system of selecting ncos for such jobs.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"we need to choose organisations with a well-established reputation which people really trust, which have been working in this area for a number of years or have been converted from another organisation with years of relevant experience.i want the government to prepare necessary amendments to laws and regulations to allow non-commercial organisations to participate in providing public social services.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"at the same time, in providing funds for such organisations, we should use competitive mechanisms more often.third, each region should have a clear programme to improve the investment climate and create new productive jobs based on the so-called best regional practices.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"these include reducing the time required to get all the permits necessary to start a new business, creating prepared industrial sites, and taking a number of other measures.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"on a more general note, we need to reward the regions which manage to increase their revenues rather than strip them of support, and to take this into account when distributing federal subsidies.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"however, that’s not enough.the government needs to prepare its proposals on how we can change the current revenue distribution between the budgets of different levels.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"as a result, regions and municipalities will play a bigger role in resolving key socio-economic problems.the main responsibility for the situation in a region lies with the governor.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"his work will be evaluated based on how many investors he manages to attract, how many jobs he creates, especially in industries not related to raw materials.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"this should be used as a basis for personnel decisions.fourth, the authorities must get rid of the property, which is not related directly to their duties.",PAFA
Russia,2010,it seems that property can never be excessive.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"but in reality, managing excessive property takes up a great deal of time, effort and money, as you all know, but the worst part of it all is that this may lead to corruption.this year, i signed an executive order reducing the number of strategic companies to a fifth of what it used to be.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"following my instructions, the government adopted a plan to privatise a large number of big companies.",PAFA
Russia,2010,the main goal of privatisation is boosting the efficiency of those companies and attracting more investment – serious investment – into the russian economy.,PAFA
Russia,2010,the revenue from this privatisation will be used primarily to modernise our economy.,PAFA
Russia,2010,similar decisions need to be taken at regional and local levels.,PAFA
Russia,2010,the law defining the general principles according to which regional authorities operate says that regional authorities may only possess the property they need to perform their duties.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"accordingly, all other property must be privatised.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"quoting a popular line, the authorities should not be owners of “plants, newspapers and ships.”",PAFA
Russia,2010,"everybody has their own direct responsibilities to deal with.fifth, modernisation will bring the expected results only when there are fair laws in place, when there are independent and respected courts and law enforcement bodies which people really trust.all these components are definitely closely connected, and it’s the whole system that needs reform rather than individual institutions.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"that is why in addition to developing legislation on the judicial system, which we have been doing for some time, we have now started reforming the ministry of the interior.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"also, we are adopting amendments that will help boost the efficiency of investigation and prosecution services.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"that’s why i have sent two bills, one on the police force and another one on the investigative committee, to the state duma.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"today, not only federal but also regional and municipal authorities must prepare to implement those new acts effectively.",PAFA
Russia,2010,they contain a lot of new things.,PAFA
Russia,2010,government officials should not be hiding in their offices while crime gangs grow and take over their territory.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"they must make sure that people don’t need to be afraid for their lives or the lives of their loved ones, that they don’t need to worry about attacks on their person, their property or their dignity.sadly, recently we’ve seen a number of tragic events that took the lives of russian people.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"to some extent, this happened because of negligence on the part of police and other government agencies.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"in some case, they even had direct ties with criminal groups.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"following one such case, i made a decision to dismiss the police chief of the krasnodar territory and asked the prosecutor general’s office, the federal security service and the investigative committee to submit their proposals regarding punishment for their officers who were responsible for maintaining law and order in that area.sixth, in my address last year i spoke about the need to amend the criminal code.",PAFA
Russia,2010,i said that the law should be tough and at the same time modern and reasonably humane.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"while bringing about justice and protecting the rights of the aggrieved party, we should not produce new members for the criminal world.",PAFA
Russia,2010,let me stress it again: punishment for minor offences should not involve imprisonment if possible.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"this is, by the way, particularly important when dealing with minors having violated the law for the first time.today i am going to introduce a law to the state duma allowing the court to use a case-by-case approach when choosing punishment.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"in a number of criminal offence categories, bottom-line sanctions will be eliminated.",PAFA
Russia,2010,the court will now be able to use such alternative punitive measures as fines and forced or compulsory labour.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"but most importantly, in the absence of the bottom-line sanctions the courts should not be guided by the gravest possible punishment.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"the power of the court consists in the unavoidability and fairness in punishment rather than harshness, while the mission of justice is not just to punish but also to correct.seventh, fighting corruption remains our fundamental task.",PAFA
Russia,2010,i believe that we must thoroughly analyse how our decisions are being implemented and move ahead.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"in our experience, even the threat of being imprisoned for up to 12 years does not stop bribe-takers.",PAFA
Russia,2010,it seems that in a number of cases economic sanctions in the form of fines may turn out to be more effective.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"thus, giving or taking a bribe may be punished with fines to an amount 100 times the size of the bribe itself.currently we are facing a new type of criminal activity – that of bribery mediation.",PAFA
Russia,2010,everybody knows way too well that there are lots of crooks hanging around courts and other government bodies who assure that they know how to resolve any issue and to whom and how much money one should give.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"i think that bribery mediation, as well as the size of the fine i’ve been talking about, should be introduced to the criminal code.eighth, there’s another issue i would like to raise.",PAFA
Russia,2010,i am not going to demonise the notorious law no.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"94 [on placing orders for goods, works and services for state and municipal needs].",PAFA
Russia,2010,"everyone is criticising it, as the situation has indeed gone beyond reasonable.",PAFA
Russia,2010,the goals it stipulates have mostly remained mere declarations.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"according to the most conservative estimates, inappropriate expenses including direct theft and kickbacks amount to at least one trillion rubles.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"therefore, it’s time to start working on a new version of the state procurement law, a modern and more balanced version.i also believe that all planned open-bid purchases must be announced in advance.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"information about such plans must be posted on a special website with a possibility to give feedback, as companies may want to bid, or experts may want to express their opinions regarding the compliance of those plans with today’s requirements and market prices.we need to define preliminary purchase plans for modern equipment, medicines and other hi-tech products by the state and major state-owned companies for the three years immediately ahead.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"in the future, we need to have similar plans for an even longer period of 5–7 years.",PAFA
Russia,2010,in this case both investors and researchers will be confident that the results of their work will be in demand.army modernisation can be another factor in boosting demand for new technology.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"like it or not, but in different periods of history it was only security issues and state investment in new technological defence solutions that were driving science and technology forward.today we are facing a fundamental task of creating a new hi-tech mobile army.",PAFA
Russia,2010,we are ready to spend more than 20 trillion rubles on it.,PAFA
Russia,2010,this is a lot of money.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"but this kind of investment will be twice as effective, if as a result, it will provide us with the so-called dual-purpose technology helping us with industrial modernisation and contributing to fundamental and applied research, as well as to academic research.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"that's why we are creating a special agency, which will search for and develop breakthrough technologies for the defence industry.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"as you know, similar agencies exist in other countries.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"we expect that many of those technologies will be applied later in everyday life.ninth, the quality of the political system is a crucial indicator of the quality of life.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"in order to improve this system, a number of decisions have been made at the federal and regional levels.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"speaking from this platform in 2008, i outlined ten points for improving our political system and democracy, and then i mentioned another ten points in 2009.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"i would like to thank again everybody who took part in discussing these initiatives, all state duma deputies and members of the federation council.however we need to take additional steps at the local self-government level.",PAFA
Russia,2010,local self-government is a major element of any democratic state.,PAFA
Russia,2010,unfortunately most of our political parties don't really play a significant role in municipalities.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"as a result, not all parties act as national political organisations at this level.",PAFA
Russia,2010,i suggest we should use proportional or mixed electoral system in elections to the legislatures in urban districts and municipal areas with 20 or more deputies.political competition at the bottom level will help build trust in the party system and make parties more accountable to voters.,PAFA
Russia,2010,they need to be closer to the everyday life of our people.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"it is another step towards strengthening our democracy, which sees the well-being of our people as its main goal.so, the state duma election next december will take place with a political system that has been renewed at all levels.tenth, all of us present here had an open and detailed discussion of the new law on the police force.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"in my opinion, this discussion has brought about some pretty good results.",PAFA
Russia,2010,we will have a similar discussion of the new law on education.,PAFA
Russia,2010,i think that we need to develop this practice.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"there should be a certain procedure for organising public discussion, like we did with the law on the police force.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"i commission my executive office to prepare – by the end of this year – their proposals on how to hold these public discussions.colleagues,our state and nation cannot develop without efficient national security and defence.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"we are moving in the direction of major modernisation of our armed forces, in the direction of systemic and deep reforms.",PAFA
Russia,2010,we have modernised the structure of our armed forces improving their combat readiness and upgrading their administrative and logistics systems.,PAFA
Russia,2010,we’ve started conducting regular large-scale military exercises again.,PAFA
Russia,2010,four military districts replaced the old six.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"under the state armament program, the troops will be equipped with modern weapons and hardware by the year 2020.",PAFA
Russia,2010,what tasks are still ahead?,PAFA
Russia,2010,"first, next year we need to put a special emphasis on aerospace defence, combining the existing missile and air defence systems, missile early-warning and airspace monitoring systems.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"they must come under a unified strategic command.second, modern russia needs a modern army and navy, compact and mobile troops equipped with modern weapons and led by professionals with the highest qualifications.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"for this we need serious funds (i just gave you the figure) and new decisions, which are sometimes not easy to make.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"at the same time, we need to fulfil all our obligations towards people who chose to serve in the army.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"first of all, we need to provide them with housing, and do that according to the existing timeline.third, the army should not have non-military duties and functions.",PAFA
Russia,2010,these functions should be transferred to civilian organisations.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"the army should focus on combat training, first of all.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"a young man is only drafted to serve for one year, but the combat training program does not get any simpler.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"every young man should be able to cover all the aspects of this programme.fourth, not only are we developing our armed forces, we are also developing international cooperation in the security sphere.",PAFA
Russia,2010,russia is ready to work on strengthening the missile non-proliferation regime with countries that are interested in it.,PAFA
Russia,2010,i shared my ideas of the possible architecture of the european missile defence system at the recent russia-nato summit in lisbon.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"this architecture would merge the potentials of russia and nato, protecting all european countries from missile strikes.",PAFA
Russia,2010,we have started a joint evaluation of all issues related to that.,PAFA
Russia,2010,this is certainly a positive development.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"but here, in this room, i would like to speak frankly.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"one of the following two things will happen within the next ten years: either we reach an agreement on missile defence and create a full-fledged cooperation mechanism, or (if we can’t come to a constructive agreement) we will see another escalation of the arms race.",PAFA
Russia,2010,we will have to make a decision to deploy new attack forces.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"it is obvious that that would be a very unfavourable scenario.the lisbon summit has made decisions related to the forming of a modern partnership, one based on the indivisibility of security, mutual trust, transparency and predictability.",PAFA

Russia,2010,these partnerships will help develop primarily the five priorities russia has set out in its technological modernisation programme.i see great potential that can be used to achieve these goals as our relations with the european union and the us expand.,PAFA
Russia,2010,"the mechanisms of russian-us partnership should be used to establish a full-scale economic cooperation, improve the investment climate and our high-tech cooperation.the partnership for modernisation agreement signed by russia and the eu, as we formulated the idea one year ago, should work in the following three areas.",PAFA
Russia,2010,"firstly, the mutual exchange of technologies, the harmonisation of technical regulations and standards, and practical assistance by the eu for russia to join the wto.secondly, a simplified visa regime with the prospect of introducing visa-free travel in the near future.thirdly, we need to seriously expand our academic and professional exchange programmes.",PAFA

Russia,2011,i congratulate all the deputies on the start of their work.,PAFA
Russia,2011,"i wish you every success and would like to assure you of my openness to dialogue on all issues.following the parliamentary elections in russia, various statements were made regarding their results, both in russia and abroad.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"some people were pleased with the elections’ results, others were not entirely satisfied, and still others were not happy at all.",PAFA
Russia,2011,it was the same after the previous elections.,PAFA
Russia,2011,this always happens.i would therefore like to stress that we treat any criticism of state institutions and individual officials with the utmost attention and respect.,PAFA
Russia,2011,"we draw relevant conclusions where criticism is valid, restore justice where laws had been broken, take the necessary decisions in consultation with the main political forces, openly state our position and justify it if the criticism is unfounded.people have a guaranteed right to express their opinions using all legitimate means but attempts to manipulate russian citizens, to mislead them and incite social discord are unacceptable.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"we will not let instigators and extremists involve society in their reckless activities, and we will not allow foreign interference in our internal affairs.russia needs democracy, not chaos; it needs faith in the future and justice.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"the fact that society is changing and people are increasingly expressing their views and making legitimate demands on the authorities are a positive sign, a sign of a maturing democracy.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"in my view, this is a positive trend that will benefit our country, just as increased political competition, which forces us to work more efficiently and to respond more promptly to the problems of millions of russian families.today i will state my proposals for the near future aimed at expanding people’s opportunities to influence russian state policy and the decisions on matters that involve their rights and interests.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"but first, if i may, i would like to talk about the results of our efforts.i am sincerely grateful to those who have given their support to my work as president of russia in the past four years.",PAFA

Russia,2011,it is less than 7% and may even be closer to 6%.,PAFA
Russia,2011,"salaries, social benefits and real incomes are the highest since the soviet period, although they are still far from our targets.",PAFA
Russia,2011,there are too many low-income families in the country although in 2011 their number came close to the lowest in 20 years.the economic crisis has clearly shown that setting aside a part of the oil revenues to make reserves has been and remains a successful policy.,PAFA
Russia,2011,due to these savings the government and the bank of russia prevented a currency crisis.,PAFA
Russia,2011,"now the volume of gold and foreign currency reserves is close to the pre-crisis level, while people’s bank deposits have increased by almost 80%.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"lending volumes have also grown.we have provided strong support to manufacturing, construction and infrastructure companies, as well as small businesses.",PAFA
Russia,2011,big companies received funding on the basis of a detailed analysis of development programmes and their readiness to preserve and create jobs.agricultural producers also received systemic support.,PAFA
Russia,2011,this has allowed the whole industry and the food market to fully recover last year’s losses caused by the drought and wildfires.the number of unemployed in the past two years has decreased by almost two million people.,PAFA

Russia,2011,it has increased by almost three years since 2006 and has reached just under 69 years.,PAFA
Russia,2011,life expectancy for women – because they take better care of themselves – is nearly 75.,PAFA
Russia,2011,we had never had such figures before.,PAFA
Russia,2011,never!,PAFA
Russia,2011,"naturally, we must strive to make these numbers even higher.",PAFA
Russia,2011,that is the aim of the new healthcare modernisation programme.,PAFA
Russia,2011,all the decisions required for its implementation have already been taken.third.,PAFA

Russia,2011,i am sure it was the right decision.,PAFA
Russia,2011,"today we can see the initial results in all priority areas of modernisation: we have achieved the highest level of funding for research and development since the soviet times, built an efficient system of development institutions and gradually decreased the energy intensity of the russian economy.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"this means – and i want everyone to stop and think about it – that the share of the utilities costs in family and company budgets will eventually stop growing, and if energy is used rationally, it can even be reduced.we have launched production of new drugs, including for the treatment of infectious diseases and cancer.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"an entire line of next generation products has been developed together with our foreign partners.we have created supercomputers supporting new competitive technologies in the nuclear and aerospace industries, shipbuilding and automotive industries; completed the development of technical documentation for the construction and operation of a new generation nuclear power station that will be highly resistant to external shocks, as well as have significantly higher economic efficiency rates.half of russian regions already use the services of the glonass navigation system and are implementing remote sensing projects.",PAFA
Russia,2011,the number of home broadband internet connections has doubled in the past three years and now the country has nearly 55 million active subscribers.,PAFA
Russia,2011,i want to emphasise that this is the highest figure among all european countries.television and radio networks are switching to digital broadcasting.,PAFA
Russia,2011,this increases the freedom of choice and stimulates competition.,PAFA
Russia,2011,"as promised, russia will have more than 20 freely available tv channels by 2015, and the number of channels offered by private broadcasting companies can be measured in hundreds.a few words about another major modernisation project, the skolkovo innovation centre.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"i am aware that there were many sceptics when we launched this project, and there are some that remain to this day.",PAFA
Russia,2011,but what do the facts tell us?,PAFA
Russia,2011,skolkovo corporate residents include over 300 companies engaged in advanced research and development.,PAFA
Russia,2011,"a modern technological university is being built, partnership agreements have been signed with leading global companies, which are setting up their research centres at skolkovo.",PAFA

Russia,2011,the political system’s modernisation has made it more efficient.,PAFA
Russia,2011,i would like to remind you that i have suggested measures for its development every year in my addresses.,PAFA

Russia,2011,meetings of the state duma and regional legislative assemblies are being broadcast live online.,PAFA
Russia,2011,this certainly increases the openness of the parliament’s work and allows the parties to inform the voters of their positions online.,PAFA
Russia,2011,"in order to ensure the rights of political parties not represented in the legislature, they have the opportunity to make regular appearances in the state duma and regional parliaments.the new procedure for forming the council of federation, which came into effect this year, should also be viewed in the context of expanding popular representation.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"now only the people who have won federal, state or municipal elections will be able to sit in the upper house of parliament.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"finally, the electoral threshold in the state duma elections has been decreased to 5%.",PAFA

Russia,2011,the financial situation of retired military personnel will also improve.,PAFA

Russia,2011,"these pensions will increase annually by at least 2% above inflation.finally, for the first time in the history of our country’s armed forces we have come close to tackling one of the toughest and most critical challenges: providing servicemen with permanent and service housing.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"in 2009–2010, the defence ministry acquired nearly 100,000 flats to provide permanent housing, and in 2011–2013 another 80,000 will be acquired for this purpose.",PAFA

Russia,2011,"today, at the new stage of the nation’s development and in support of the new initiative put forward by prime minister vladimir putin, i propose a comprehensive reform of our political system.i would like to say that i hear all those who talk about the need for change, and i understand them.",PAFA
Russia,2011,we must give all active citizens a legitimate opportunity to participate in the country’s political life.,PAFA
Russia,2011,"to achieve that, i believe the following measures are necessary.to return to direct regional elections for the heads of russian constituent entities.to introduce a simplified procedure for the registration of political parties.",PAFA
Russia,2011,my suggestion is that it should require an application signed by at least 500 people representing no less than 50% of the regions.next.,PAFA
Russia,2011,"to abolish the requirement to collect signatures for the elections to the state duma and regional legislatures.finally, to reduce the number of voter signatures needed to participate in the presidential elections to 300,000, and for candidates from non-parliamentary parties to 100,000.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"in addition, i propose to change the state duma election system.",PAFA
Russia,2011,i consider it expedient for strengthening the links between the deputies and the electorate to introduce proportional representation of 225 districts.,PAFA
Russia,2011,this measure will allow each region to have a direct representative in parliament.,PAFA
Russia,2011,"now, unfortunately, as everybody knows, some constituent entities of the russian federation do not have a single deputy elected by local residents.i also suggest changing the procedure for forming the central and regional election commissions.",PAFA
Russia,2011,we should have broader representation by political parties in the election commissions.,PAFA

Russia,2011,"ancient chinese philosopher lao tzu once said that governance must be consistent, business must spring from opportunities, and all actions must take time into account.",PAFA

Russia,2011,a package of draft laws on decentralisation will be submitted to the state duma.,PAFA

Russia,2011,"we will discuss the budgets’ volumes separately, but i feel the figure may be as high as one trillion rubles.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"this should create the conditions for our territories’ successful development, for better fulfilment of the state’s obligations to the people.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"in particular, we will gradually abolish federal exemptions for regional and local taxes.",PAFA
Russia,2011,the timeframe for this should be analysed by the cabinet separately.,PAFA
Russia,2011,many regions will impose real estate tax instead of property tax.,PAFA
Russia,2011,"in addition, regions and municipalities must be given much broader rights in managing the funds coming from the federal budget.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"excessive regulation, which impedes independent work on a local level, will be eliminated and the system of financial support for regional budgets will encourage the diversification of the regions’ own revenue base.finally, regional heads will get the right to bring up the issue of delegating a significant number of public powers from the federal to the regional level – if they are ready for it, of course.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"at the same time, some of the powers may be additionally given to all regions by a federal law – first and foremost, those powers that directly influence the investment climate and socioeconomic development of those regions.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"at the same time, we should seriously strengthen the material base of municipalities, of local self-government as an institution closest to the people.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"municipalities must get a solid and predictable financial base for their work.there will also be other changes, which we will discuss in the coming months.",PAFA
Russia,2011,and it is certain that the process of power decentralisation will go hand in hand with higher political liability of regional and municipal leaders as regards the final results of their work on developing their territories and increasing the quality of services offered to their citizens.third.,PAFA
Russia,2011,"during the first half of next year, we must replace our “beloved” 94th law with a federal law contemplating the creation of a federal contract system.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"new procedures for government and municipal procurement must ensure high quality in the fulfilment of government orders and prevent monopoly price-setting and multi-billion ruble corruption schemes.in order to further counter corruption, i feel we should start monitoring spending by individuals holding public office or serving within certain federal state services, in cases when their expenditures clearly do not correspond with their income.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"i am talking about declaring major expenditures for purchasing land, other real estate, vehicles and securities.by introducing this provision, along with larger fines established by our criminal legislation, possibility of being dismissed on a loss-of-confidence basis for corruption-related violations, and other existing measures, we are essentially implementing the goal of the un convention against corruption as regards establishing liability for unlawful enrichment.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"and this liability is established in accordance with the principles of our legal system.i also feel we should look into broadening the list of individuals whose incomes are subject to declaration.in addition, we need to think about how to radically reduce the economic interest in committing profit-motivated crimes, in addition to already-existing measures (i am referring to larger fines and confiscation).",PAFA
Russia,2011,"finally, i think it would be expedient to impose restrictions on transactions between state institutions and profit-making organisations whose major shareholders include close relatives of the heads of such government institutions or state-owned companies.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"the number of cases like this in our nation is enormous.fourth, we are in the final stage of a full-scale transfer to electronic document management system as regards carrying out state functions and providing public services to our citizens.beginning on july 1, 2012, all regions and many municipalities will switch to electronic interdepartmental interaction.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"we are expanding our citizen’s opportunities to receive many state and municipal services remotely, including through the use of a corresponding internet portal and with the help of universal electronic cards.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"in just a few months, millions of people from all across our nation, from the most distant of our regions, will start using them.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"it will be easier for citizens to communicate with the government in real time and to save time and money, in addition to the fact that electronic technologies provide the best level of transparency, which is essential in countering corruption.fifth.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"soon, we will begin implementing programmes i have initiated to support families with three or more children, as well as teachers, doctors, young engineers and scientists.",PAFA
Russia,2011,they must have better opportunities to improve their living standards with the help of a preferential mortgage.sixth.,PAFA
Russia,2011,one of the important challenges for all government agencies and for society as a whole is the full-fledged implementation of the barrier-free environment programme.,PAFA
Russia,2011,i would like to point out that we have allotted a significant amount of funding for its implementation.,PAFA
Russia,2011,"step by step, we will reduce barriers for people with disabilities; we will work on helping them get jobs and significantly improve the number of schools providing inclusive education.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"our attitudes toward people with disabilities, the efforts we are making, are imperative for reducing the barriers and restrictions in their lives and opportunities.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"this is important for all of us, for all of society.seventh.",PAFA
Russia,2011,we will implement all plans as regards public sector development.,PAFA
Russia,2011,"in particular, in 2012, we will step up work to deal with the shortage of places in pre-schools.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"for children aged 3+, i think we can fully solve this problem in the next five years.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"at the same time, we must not just resolve it, but do so while increasing the salaries for teachers and educators working with children.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"we will also continue to increase salaries for schoolteachers.at the same time, we must give particular attention to improving the situation on a regional and local level at cultural institutions that work directly with children – i am referring to art schools, museums, clubs and libraries.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"they are facing difficulties, and the government must help the regions implement programmes in this area.eighth.",PAFA
Russia,2011,the government will take additional measures to encourage placement of orphans in foster families.,PAFA
Russia,2011,"i will give relevant instructions to the government in the next few days, and i also think that the regional heads must adopt programmes to provide medical, psychological, and educational support for families taking in orphans.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"they need help, and such help must be practical.in addition, every region must finalize the development of social adaptation programmes for youth coming out of orphanages.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"let me remind you that in many territories, this instruction has not yet been carried out.ninth.",PAFA
Russia,2011,on further steps regarding criminal law and judicial proceedings.,PAFA
Russia,2011,"in the first six months of next year, draft laws will be prepared to help form a social rehabilitation system for citizens who have finished serving or are currently serving penalties that do not involve imprisonment.a special role in conducing efficient criminal policy must be given to the judicial system.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"it determines whether our system for imposing penalties becomes more flexible, graded, and therefore, more just.",PAFA
Russia,2011,we will continue working to improve the quality of the judicial corps.,PAFA
Russia,2011,"and one of the first steps is to create a system of independent examination commissions, which will assess all candidates for the high office of judge.the number of judges per capita in our nation is about the same as in most european nations.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"but remember, russian judges look at far more cases, dozens times more, primarily because nearly 80 per cent of disputes in these nations are resolved with the help of reconciliation procedures, as was the case, incidentally, in pre-revolutionary russia.unfortunately, at this time, we have practically no culture of holding a dialogue and finding mutually acceptable solutions.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"the laws we have passed on mediation barely work at all, and cases when an agreement is reached are still rare.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"we need to make our citizens better aware of the option to resolve disputes with the help of a qualified mediator, and to consider the expediency of implementing the mandatory use of mediation procedures in resolving certain types of conflicts.and tenth.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"two months ago, i suggested expanding beyond the framework of our established institutions and creating an extended, or perhaps more accurately, open government, aimed at resolving strategic and operative tasks by uniting all levels and branches of power, public figures, experts, and everyone who is prepared to participate in the processes of really running the state affairs, to contribute to the development and expert evaluation of the most important decisions and programmes.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"this kind of open government is, in essence, a social lift for the most active and talented people, a talent pool for renewing and reinforcing executive government in the centre and in the regions.we have already launched the rotation of civil servants.",PAFA
Russia,2011,the talent pools created in our nation encompass nearly one hundred thousand individuals.,PAFA
Russia,2011,that is a large number.,PAFA
Russia,2011,more than 200 people from the presidential talent pool created at my suggestion have been appointed to higher positions.,PAFA
Russia,2011,"but to be frank, this work needs to be done more consistently and more actively.finally, an open government is an effective way to get feedback that allows us to assess the efficacy of government policy, to build the work of the government in a fundamentally different way, to make it modern, relying on local initiatives.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"eisenhower once said that the slogan of a true democracy is not “let the government do it,” but “let’s do it ourselves.”",PAFA
Russia,2011,i absolutely agree with these words.these mechanisms will begin to function in just a few weeks.,PAFA
Russia,2011,"and at the first stage this will happen within the framework of a special temporary group, a body created to serve these purposes.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"one of the first projects will be a public contest to identify the most pointless, suffocating bureaucratic procedures.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"hopefully, we will have a corresponding website up at the start of the new year.i would like to now address everyone who has encountered these procedures: please tell us about them, if you feel they are detrimental to normal life and the full-fledged development of our nation.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"decisions will be made to eliminate or adjust certain procedures on the basis of your suggestions; we will also be making personnel-related decisions where necessary.overall, i believe we should use all modern information technologies to improve public communication.",PAFA
Russia,2011,i am giving this my utmost attention.,PAFA
Russia,2011,"we need to use everything we have, and create the things we don’t have.so i suggest we work on creating public television in the near future, possibly on the basis of one of the existing federal channels.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"in this case, none of the owners of this new type of media will have a determining influence in making any decisions – neither the government nor the private owners.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"i am certain that this kind of public television can make our information environment more competitive and therefore more interesting.colleagues, i have listed the challenges i will focus on in the upcoming months.",PAFA
Russia,2011,our citizens’ choice will determine what our federal and executive authorities will look like in the subsequent period.,PAFA
Russia,2011,"this is an important election that will decide our common future, particularly given the difficult situation unfolding around the world.you know, the financial turmoil has already resulted in a decline of the leading nations’ financial capacity and a sharp slowdown in their growth rates.",PAFA
Russia,2011,fears about the main reserve currencies and concerns regarding the position of transnational banks currently have a greater influence on investors than the situation in the real economy.,PAFA
Russia,2011,"it is true, there is the developing world with a big share of the planet’s population, and this developing world continues to grow; but it cannot fully compensate for setbacks of the global economy’s former powerhouses.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"thus, there are many politicians, heads of international organisations, leading economists and businesspeople who are talking about the onset of a global depression.friends, it is obvious that difficult times are ahead of us.",PAFA
Russia,2011,i have already said that our nation withstood the test of the crisis admirably.,PAFA
Russia,2011,the present team managed these trials.,PAFA
Russia,2011,"i hope we will overcome the new challenges as well, regardless of who becomes the president of russia or the prime minister.",PAFA
Russia,2011,there is a set of absolute priorities that the nation’s leaders will pursue in order to ensure its successful development.,PAFA
Russia,2011,"incidentally, i was once again reminded of this during the election campaign, when i spent a particularly great deal of time talking to people; i came to a number of conclusions which strengthened my conviction that our choice of strategy and modernisation was the right one.let’s see: clearly, the greater our achievements, the more acutely we perceive the problems which have not been resolved.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"the more successful our society is overall, the more clearly we see displays of poverty, unlawfulness, and injustice.",PAFA
Russia,2011,people have grown tired of lacking the opportunity to resolve the most critical problems within a reasonable time.,PAFA
Russia,2011,"people are sick of their interests being ignored, or sometimes not even noticed at all.it is unfair when thousands of families essentially live in barbaric conditions, lacking the simplest housing services and utilities, when children from distant villages cannot receive a normal education, when people do not have the opportunity to reach places where they can receive high-quality medical assistance or other modern services if they do not have the means to find a decent job, and often, they don’t have prospects for finding any kind of job at all.it is unacceptable when entrepreneurs and investors in most regions spend months fighting their way through bureaucratic barriers and at every step they find themselves at the mercy of officials’ arbitrary rule, including those officials who lobby in the interests of their competitors.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"finally, our citizens are suffering from unjust decisions and the ineffective performance of judiciary acts.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"i repeat: all these problems exist, but we are aware of them and know how the future leaders of our country should deal with them.what do we need to do?",PAFA
Russia,2011,"first, russia must create the broadest possible opportunities for the operations of small and medium-sized businesses.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"this would allow us to benefit from innovation and create millions of new high-performance jobs, to attract private, including foreign, investments for the creation of a modern industry, high-performance agriculture, so-called smart infrastructure, housing, and the service sector.",PAFA
Russia,2011,i would repeat what i have already said more than once: improving the business climate is the best way to ensure dynamic economic growth.,PAFA
Russia,2011,there is no better way!,PAFA
Russia,2011,i consider maintaining macroeconomic stability crucial to being able to successfully achieve these goals.,PAFA
Russia,2011,"with high inflation and interest rates, our goals would simply become unattainable, so we have to maintain low levels of budget deficit and public debt.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"the government’s financing commitments should be met primarily through income received from high rates of economic growth, the improvement of tax and customs administration, as well as the full implementation of the programme designed to privatise government assets.inflation and interest rates must come down to more acceptable levels through the development of competition and the reduction of associated legal and financial risks.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"this is necessary both for the development of our financial system and the creation of an international financial centre in moscow, something that we have been working on lately.just as during the crisis three years ago, neither the central bank nor the government have the right to tolerate disruptions in the foreign exchange market or the banking sector.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"for that reason we must all continue to live within our means and not fritter away our financial resources, especially in the light of the coming global recession.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"however, our intention to live responsibly does not mean that we should abandon new social programmes, or even reduce existing benefits.",PAFA
Russia,2011,all these commitments will be kept in full.,PAFA
Russia,2011,"this applies to pensions, measures to support families with children, healthcare, creating a barrier-free environment for disabled people, as well as the development of education and culture.along with this, we need to determine the long-term development strategy of our pension system as soon as possible.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"i think we need to give citizens the opportunity to choose when to retire, based on the expected pensions to salaries ratio, and as soon as the crisis is over return to more actively encouraging voluntary retirement savings.we must implement programmes to modernise healthcare in all russian regions.",PAFA
Russia,2011,new legislation on healthcare will allow us to determine the guaranteed volume and quality of health services.,PAFA
Russia,2011,and when allocating resources to this issue we need to improve the material base of healthcare facilities and to increase the salaries of medical personnel.,PAFA
Russia,2011,"at the same time, our entire society must make every effort to ensure that a healthy lifestyle becomes the norm.we need to continue implementing our national initiative: our new school.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"our priorities for the coming years are the comprehensive development of a new system for searching out and supporting young talents, a transition to a practice-oriented education model in middle and high school, and the transformation of schools into the central focus of multiple lives, not just places where children are taught.",PAFA
Russia,2011,it is necessary to train a new generation of teachers who have all the skills required by modern pedagogy and receive a decent wage for their work.we must correct another extreme condition or situation in higher education which has developed over the past 20 years.,PAFA
Russia,2011,"unfortunately, in that field the trend remains, not classical or research universities, strong universities, but rather hundreds of third-rate institutions.",PAFA
Russia,2011,we need to continue building a network of modern universities which meet international standards both in terms of the quality of education on offer and the level of research conducted.we must purposefully work at ensuring a cultural revival.,PAFA
Russia,2011,this may be one of the main factors in russia’s modernisation.,PAFA
Russia,2011,we must support both traditional schools and new projects in all artistic fields.,PAFA
Russia,2011,"we must pay special attention to upgrading infrastructure in the cultural spheres, using modern technologies, as well as increasing the salaries of those who have dedicated themselves to this important cause.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"currently, the average wage in this sector is only half that of the average monthly wage in the economy in general – this is both unfair and completely shortsighted.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"along with this, our cultural heritage should be as accessible as possible to children.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"familiarity with the finest examples of the art world and, of course, independent creative work should be part of the educational process.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"but while there are numerous such opportunities in big cities, small and medium-sized ones require special support.harmonising interethnic relations within our country remains an absolute priority.",PAFA
Russia,2011,russia is inhabited by representatives of more than 180 peoples that speak 239 languages and dialects.,PAFA
Russia,2011,"this multicultural world is also russia’s unique advantage, a world in which representatives of different nationalities and faiths have lived together for more than a thousand years.in general, our society does not support extremism and other ideologies which are founded on hate.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"the scholar [dmitry] likhachev wrote: ”nationalism is a reflection of a nation’s weakness, not its strength.“",PAFA
Russia,2011,this is a profoundly correct remark.,PAFA
Russia,2011,"but a significant tension between international and internal migration remains to this day, especially in large cities.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"sometimes it results in ethnic hatred and conflict.we need to address the economic foundations of large-scale internal migration, and of the concentration of emigration in some russian regions.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"we should create the conditions for the rapid development of areas that are currently losing population.in addition, we must pay more attention to our children’s cultural and moral education, and in fact teach them mutual respect and tolerance just as grammar or history are taught in school today.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"this is necessary in order to save our country.and naturally, we must be consistent and uncompromising in our fight against all forms of extremism and crimes aimed at inciting ethnic hatred.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"let me stress that this work remains a constant priority.dear colleagues, over the next decade our armed forces must be significantly upgraded.",PAFA
Russia,2011,i just talked about the very important decisions taken regarding pay increases for troops and service housing.,PAFA
Russia,2011,by 2020 at least 70 percent of russia’s army should be equipped with new weapons and high-tech military equipment.,PAFA
Russia,2011,"a modern, well-equipped army would imply a consistent reduction in the number of conscripts and replace them with professionals who work on contract.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"by 2017 these professionals should number 425,000.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"russia's foreign policy should be dictated by its geopolitical situation, the need to ensure our national security, and our partnership with other countries in the interests of our citizens.not very long ago i spoke about our fundamental approach to the problem of missile defence.",PAFA
Russia,2011,i will not go into detail about it again – everyone knows my opinion.,PAFA
Russia,2011,"i would just like to confirm one thing, namely that we are open to constructive dialogue and substantive work with our partners, if they are ready to listen to us.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"and we expect that they will take steps in our direction in order to achieve a mutually acceptable solution as soon as possible, as well as to preserve an atmosphere of trust.",PAFA
Russia,2011,we look forward to continuing discussions and work on a new european security treaty.we are interested in finding mutually acceptable solutions to all crucial outstanding issues on the international agenda.,PAFA
Russia,2011,"thus, one of our constant priorities remains overcoming the effects of the global crisis.",PAFA
Russia,2011,it is our shared priority.,PAFA
Russia,2011,"it remains extremely important to fully implement the decisions made by the g20 concerning the stabilisation of the financial situation of a number of leading countries, and international financial system reform.i will remind you that in recent years i have talked about a range of initiatives in these fields.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"specifically, they include the idea of establishing an international mechanism to prevent and eliminate the effects of disasters on the sea shelf, strengthening the international regime governing nuclear safety, the establishment of a new legal framework for energy security, the protection of intellectual property rights in the light of the development of the internet and, finally, the fight against piracy at sea.we look forward to working together to implement these proposals.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"some of them have already been discussed in the g8 format, others in a broader one.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"i believe that it would be useful to exploit the potential of brics countries and the shanghai cooperation organisation to promote them.the events of these past months have demonstrated the relevance of our role as mediator in solving serious regional problems using political and diplomatic means, without foreign interference or the use of force and, of course, under the auspices of the united nations.finally, an absolute priority for the coming years is providing an additional stimulus to integration processes and strengthening cooperation with our closest partners.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"the most important aspect of this work is strengthening allied relations within the framework of the collective security treaty organisation, especially in crisis situations, including by exploiting the potential of the collective rapid reaction force.we need to make use of the enormous potential of the customs union and, naturally, that of the common economic space that we just created.on a practical level we have decided to take up an ambitious task, namely the creation of the eurasian economic union.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"this new arrangement will be set up to achieve the maximum benefit from our economies and produce simple, practical, tangible results for our citizens.an important feature of the eurasian economic union is its openness to our partners in the eurasec, cis, and others too.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"depending on how ready they are, they can join our work.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"we expect that this economic union will bring together the european and asia-pacific regions, and act as an influential force and prized partner in the global economy.citizens of russia, dear friends.all these years i have been guided by one purpose, that of making life better for our citizens, making them feel safer and more confident with regards to the future of their children and grandchildren, and so that the older generation can live a decent life.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"this is why it was so important to maintain economic and political stability, and so critically necessary to begin our country’s modernisation.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"but there really are difficult times ahead.the global depression could last for several years and the competition for minds, ideas, and resources will only intensify.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"meanwhile, we are at the epicentre of this rivalry.",PAFA
Russia,2011,but even in these difficult conditions we have no right to pause our development.,PAFA
Russia,2011,"such work will require perseverance, strength and, naturally, time to overcome inertia and a great deal of old stereotypes.",PAFA
Russia,2011,and we can only take this difficult path together.it is true that we do not all perceive the world in the same way; sometimes we have very different ideas about priorities.,PAFA
Russia,2011,"there are different opinions about how to proceed, but at the end of the day we all want one thing, namely a better life for our citizens.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"therefore we must learn to listen to each other, respect public opinion, and refrain from imposing top-down solutions.and we must continue what we have begun, continue with renewing our state and society from its depths.",PAFA
Russia,2011,"that's why i want every one of us to become conscious of the responsibility he or she bears for the way their friends and family live, the success of their own affairs and, by implication, the future of our beloved country.i am fully aware of my responsibility for everything that remains to be done.",PAFA
Russia,2011,i believe in each of you and i know that we will succeed.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"citizens of russia,federation council members and state duma deputies,recently, just a few months ago, in the articles written during the presidential election campaign and then in the executive orders signed in may 2012 i set out our position and our short and medium term plans.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"they covered all areas of our work and our lives: the economy, social sphere, domestic policy, international affairs and security issues.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"these documents describe our plans in detail, sometimes citing specific figures and deadlines.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"some of them are already being implemented, for example raising teachers’ wages and some other tasks.",PAFA
Russia,2012,we have put together the required regulatory framework with regard to all other items on our agenda.,PAFA
Russia,2012,the work has begun.,PAFA
Russia,2012,i want to assure all citizens of our country that it will continue; we will tackle all the tasks we have set without fail.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"the commission that was created specifically for this purpose will monitor these efforts.today, in my first address to the federal assembly since being elected president, i will not speak in detail about those plans.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"it is too early to talk about any substantial adjustments but there are several points i would like to make in this regard.i would like to highlight some of the key aspects of our progress, questions that are fundamental for russia’s present and future not only in the medium but also in the long term, the most basic issues for each and every one of us.a great deal has been achieved in the first twelve years of the new century.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"the stage of national reconstruction and strengthening, which is enormous in its importance, has been completed.",PAFA
Russia,2012,our task now is to build a rich and prosperous russia.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"i would like all of us to understand clearly that the coming years will be decisive and perhaps even ground-breaking not only for us, but for the entire world as it enters a period of transition and possibly even shocks.global development is becoming increasingly unequal.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"this creates a fertile ground for new economic, geopolitical and ethnic conflicts.",PAFA
Russia,2012,competition for resources is becoming more intense.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"and i can assure you and want to emphasise that this competition will not be limited only to metals, oil and gas, but above all will focus on human resources and intelligence.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"who will take the lead and who will remain outsiders and inevitably lose their independence will depend not only on the economic potential, but primarily on the will of each nation, on its inner energy which lev gumilev termed “passionarity”: the ability to move forward and to embrace change.people in countries with developed economies and many countries with developing economies have become used to constant consumption growth, the expansion of life and cultural opportunities.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"that is good but it is possible to ensure the continuation of such growth in the modern world only through the introduction of a new technological order, and that is a great obstacle in many parts of the world.",PAFA
Russia,2012,a country that is unable to secure its place among the developers of new innovative technologies is not just doomed to dependence: the share of the global ”pie“ which will benefit its businesses and citizens will be much smaller than that of the leaders.,PAFA
Russia,2012,see how the revenue is distributed today between those who produce intellectual products and the consumers of the end product.,PAFA
Russia,2012,the share is 15% and 75–80%.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"in the 21st century amid a new balance of economic, civilisational and military forces russia must be a sovereign and influential country.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"we should not just develop with confidence, but also preserve our national and spiritual identity, not lose our sense of national unity.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"we must be and remain russia.after 70 years of the soviet period, russian people went through a period when the importance of their private interests regained its relevance.",PAFA
Russia,2012,that was a necessary and natural stage.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"however, working for one’s own interests has its limits.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"prosperity cannot be achieved if chaos, disorder and insecurity reign beyond the walls of your house.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"you cannot live without having regard for others, without helping the weak, without extending your responsibility beyond the responsibility of your family or profession.",PAFA
Russia,2012,today more and more people in our country understand this.,PAFA
Russia,2012,this has lead to the rise of civic engagement.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"people begin to relate their own lives and work with caring for others, with the aspirations of the entire nation and the interests of the state.today is december 12, the constitution day, and i would like to say a few words about the values that are rooted in the fundamental law of our country.",PAFA
Russia,2012,the nation-wide responsibility for our country to the present and future generations is hailed by the constitution as a fundamental principle of the russian state.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"it is in civil responsibility and patriotism that i see the consolidating force behind our policy.being a patriot means not only to treat one’s national history with love and respect, although, of course, that is very important, but first and foremost to serve one’s country and society.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"as solzhenitsyn said, patriotism is an organic, natural feeling.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"and as a society cannot survive without civil responsibility, so a country, especially a multinational one, cannot exist without a nationwide responsibility.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"these are remarkable words, they really bring it home.a sense of responsibility for one’s country cannot be instilled with slogans or appeals; people must see that the authorities are transparent, accessible, work hard for the benefit of the country, city, region, village and every citizen, and respond to public opinion.",PAFA
Russia,2012,the authorities must not be an isolated caste.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"this is the only way to build a strong moral foundation for creative work, an affirmation of order and freedom, morality and civic solidarity, justice and truth, and nationally oriented consciousness.what will guarantee russia's sovereignty in the 21st century?",PAFA
Russia,2012,we often talk about this today.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"first, the country must have a sufficient amount of its own resources.",PAFA
Russia,2012,this is not so that we could produce everything at home.,PAFA
Russia,2012,nobody lives like this anymore and i think that no one will ever live like this again.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"russia must not only preserve its geopolitical relevance – it must multiply it, it must generate demand among our neighbours and partners.",PAFA
Russia,2012,i emphasise that this is in our own interest.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"this applies to our economy, culture, science and education, as well as our diplomacy, particularly the ability to mobilise collective actions at the international level.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"last but not least it applies to our military might that guarantees russia’s security and independence.against the background of conflicting processes in the world, the interests of the nation require decisive action.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"we must look ahead and focus on the future.colleagues,in the 20th century russia went through two world wars and a civil war, through revolutions, and twice it experienced the collapse of a unified state.",PAFA
Russia,2012,the whole way of life changed radically in our country several times.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"as a result, at the beginning of the 21st century, we were faced with a real demographic and moral catastrophe, with a demographic and moral crisis.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"if the nation is unable to preserve and reproduce itself, if it loses vital references and ideals, it does not need an external enemy because it will fall apart on its own.i have talked about this many times but i want to emphasise it again.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"for russia to be a sovereign and strong nation there must be more of us and we must be better in our morality, competences, work and creative endeavours.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"today, the share of the young, active, working population aged 20 to 40 years in russia is one of the highest among the developed countries.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"but in just 20 years, this age group could be reduced by half.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"if nothing is done, this trend will continue.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"either right now we can open up a lifelong outlook for the young generation to secure good, interesting jobs, to create their own businesses, to buy housing, to build large and strong families and bring up many children, to be happy in their own country, or in just a few decades, russia will become a poor, hopelessly aged (in the literal sense of the word) country, unable to preserve its independence and even its territory.the demographic programmes adopted in the past decade have shown their effectiveness.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"the country's population has not only stabilised, but it has also begun to grow.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"in january-september 2012, it has grown by more than 200,000 people.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"for the first time in our country’s recent history, natural population growth has been posted for five months in a row: the birth rate has finally started to exceed the death rate.in the past four years life expectancy in russia has grown by almost 2.5 years (this is a good indicator) and has exceeded 70 years.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"however, the mortality rate remains very high, especially among middle-aged men.",PAFA
Russia,2012,together we must fight the frankly irresponsible attitude in society towards healthy living.,PAFA
Russia,2012,along with the development of public healthcare more attention should be paid to preventive care.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"naturally, this does not mean that we should focus less attention on improving healthcare and increasing its accessibility – not at all.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"however, it is not enough to limit our efforts to medicine.",PAFA
Russia,2012,the government should introduce programmes for replacing jobs with hazardous conditions and improving road safety.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"only smoking (we know this well as we have discussed this many times already), alcohol and drug addiction cause hundreds of thousands of premature deaths in our country every year.a vitally important area is the development of physical fitness and sport, especially among young people.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"after all, the reason why we will be hosting the biggest international sports events is to encourage people to exercise, to raise the popularity and prestige of sports and fitness.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"but this task, the task of promoting sports and fitness, mass sports, cannot be achieved through international sporting events and even increasing the hours of physical education in schools and universities.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"we need new methods, a wide range of not only sports, but also fitness activities, especially for children, and i want to emphasise this: activities for young children.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"as we know, lifelong habits and interest are formed at this age, and we must work to encourage them.i believe it is crucial to support the idea of creating associations of student sports clubs.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"such an organisation would not only contribute to the development of university sports, but in a sense could give a social boost for talented, focused and active young people.",PAFA
Russia,2012,i think it is important that such an organisation remains beyond politics and unites young people with a wide variety of political views.we have adopted a programme providing family (maternity) capital at the birth of the second child.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"it is being implemented successfully, and will continue to be implemented until the end of 2016.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"we will fulfil all our obligations under this programme.i want to stress once again: the programme was adopted until 2016, that is, every family that has a second child before 2016 will receive maternity capital and other benefits as required by law.",PAFA
Russia,2012,this does not mean that i now want to encourage women to have a second child.,PAFA
Russia,2012,women know what they need to do and when.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"but it is our responsibility to inform people, just as we must decide what to do with this programme after 2016.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"starting in 2013, we will begin paying additional benefits for the third and subsequent children in those regions where the demographic situation is worse than the national average.we have 50 such regions in the russian federation, and most of them are concentrated in the central, northwestern, volga and far eastern federal districts.in addition, i would like to remind the heads of all russian regions about the need to adopt and implement their own regional demographic programmes.",PAFA
Russia,2012,demographers say that the decision to have a second child is a potential decision to have a third.,PAFA
Russia,2012,it is important that more families take this step.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"and, despite some experts’ doubts (with all due respect), i still believe that families with three children should become the standard in russia.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"but a great deal must be done to make this a reality.first of all, we must create a favourable environment for women so that they do not fear that the birth of the second and subsequent children will limit their career opportunities, their chances to find a good job and will force them to become housewives.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"our efforts to eliminate waiting lists for kindergartens, introduce vocational training programmes for women who have children and provide support for flexible forms of employment will have a direct influence on each family’s decision to have the second and third child.special attention should be given to pre-school education, including support for the creation of private pre-schools.",PAFA
Russia,2012,the government has already eliminated many barriers in this area.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"please finalise this work in the first six months of 2013, and i ask the regions to make active use of the opportunities provided.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"we must finally let the people work normally so that they can open small home-based kindergartens and all-day childcare, which means that parents will have a choice of day care without the waiting lists and all the anxiety.i am confident that we have a unique opportunity in the next decade to fundamentally resolve another long-standing russian problem: housing.",PAFA
Russia,2012,i think this is the most important issue both for the government and heads of the russian regions.,PAFA
Russia,2012,in the first stage of the housing national project we successfully promoted the development of mortgage loans.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"in the past two years, these loans have been growing by 40–50% a year.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"this is a good indicator, but frankly, as we know, mortgage loans mostly benefit people with above average incomes.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"other people cannot afford them.therefore, now, at the new stage, we must attempt to resolve the housing problem for a broader range of people: young families, social sphere professionals, doctors, teachers, scientists and engineers, and take measures to increase the commissioning of affordable economy class housing, as well as greatly enhance the opportunities to rent housing.",PAFA
Russia,2012,some regions already have pilot projects that serve as case studies for various forms of rental market support.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"such housing must be affordable to working people.we also emphasise that in 2013–2014 we will fully meet our obligations to provide housing to military personnel and war veterans, and make significant progress in relocating people from unfit housing.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"in the next few years all people who were recognised on january 1, 2012 to be in need of better living conditions due to the poor state of their housing will move into their new flats.we have set the goal to create and modernise 25 million jobs by 2020.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"this is a very ambitious and difficult challenge, but we can achieve it.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"we can help people find good, interesting employment.",PAFA
Russia,2012,quality jobs will become the driving force for the growth of wages and wellbeing.,PAFA
Russia,2012,that is the most important aspect of our work.,PAFA
Russia,2012,we need to revive engineering schools and professional training.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"overall, we must pay more attention to working people.i am instructing the government cabinet to develop and implement a national system for evaluating the quality of professional training in the next two years.i also want to particularly mention the social sector.",PAFA
Russia,2012,the specialists working there are known as public-sector employees.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"however, these people are highly educated and highly qualified, and in terms of their work, their cultural needs and social engagement, they are members of the so-called creative class.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"this creative class, or if we use the traditional term, the intelligentsia, is comprised, first and foremost, of doctors, teachers, university educators, workers in science and culture; these people are working in every region, in every village, in every city.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"at the same time, in terms of their incomes, they are still beyond the middle class level and are unable to afford proper vacations or comfortable living conditions, and must constantly seek additional sources of income.for many years, the government underpaid these specialists, simply because it did not have the means, primarily because we needed to resolve other, more pressing problems such as increasing pensions, because the elderly were in an even worse situation, often living below the poverty line.now, we can radically change the situation in the social sectors.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"i laid out my suggestions in detail in the executive orders i mentioned, as well as my pre-election articles.",PAFA
Russia,2012,the executive orders signed in may set the parameters for wage increases for every category of workers in these sectors.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"i am asking the heads of federal and regional government agencies to mobilise all their resources to implement this goal, and not just because these are our pre-election promises, although that is certainly very important – we must fulfil every promise we made.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"but even more importantly, if we fulfil this goal, we will be able to solve several key problems at once.first of all, we will see a significant improvement in the quality of healthcare and education, because new, talented professionals will be drawn to these fields.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"and current workers in these areas will get the opportunity to focus on their main jobs, improve their training, and not take on additional side jobs and overtime.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"this is how we hope to eradicate such problems as day-to-day corruption and indifference to one’s responsibilities – everything that so greatly offends and hurts people today.second, the number of citizens who classify as members of the middle class will grow significantly – by a quarter.",PAFA
Russia,2012,this will be particularly noticeable in the regions.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"we will support the revival of provincial intelligentsia, which was once russia’s professional and moral backbone.third, professional communities of medical workers, educators, scientists and cultural workers will gain a new impetus for development.",PAFA
Russia,2012,these communities must become the core of a competent and active civil society.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"it is fundamentally important for society to have the opportunity to objectively assess the state of science and the social sector.i am asking the government cabinet, jointly with the presidential executive office, to put together suggestions on creating a system for publicly monitoring the quality of healthcare, education, results of academic research and the need for cultural institutions by april of next year.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"first and foremost, we must attract professionals to these lines of work, and to look at international best practices.let me stress that it would be incorrect to perceive the programme of professional development support as simply increasing everyone’s wages equally, without taking into account the qualifications and the actual input of each and every worker.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"every organisation – medical, educational, scientific – must create its own programme for development and personnel renewal.in this respect, i would also like to say the following.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"all of us (i do not know anybody who would be against this) speak about the need to restructure various sectors, but as soon as the restructuring process begins, we hear people complaining: this should not be touched, that should not be approached.",PAFA
Russia,2012,we must avoid and eliminate this.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"if we understand what needs to be done, then we must do it, but at the same time, we must do it wisely.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"here, i must agree with everyone who feels this work should be carried out in constant dialogue with the professional communities; we must always explain our policies.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"i am also asking media executives and leading journalists to give particular attention to the transformations happening in these areas – this is a highly important nationwide challenge.i am confident that growth of wages will attract top graduates to education, healthcare and science sectors.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"indeed, we are already seeing the beginning of this process.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"in the last three years, medical universities have taken the lead with the highest average final school exam [ege] score among their applicants, leaving economics and law departments behind.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"this year, we have seen a significant change in the knowledge level of applicants to teaching professions.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"the number of talented, well-advanced school graduates who have enrolled in pedagogical universities has increased significantly.colleagues, today, in our cities and villages, we are seeing the results of what has been happening in our nation, in society, in schools, in the media, and in our heads for the past fifteen to twenty years.",PAFA
Russia,2012,and this is understandable.,PAFA
Russia,2012,that was the time when we discarded all ideological slogans of the previous era.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"but unfortunately, many moral guides have been lost too.",PAFA
Russia,2012,we ended up throwing out the baby with the bath water.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"today, this is often manifested in people’s indifference to public affairs, willingness to tolerate corruption, brazen greed, manifestations of extremism and offensive behaviour.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"and all of this occasionally takes an ugly, aggressive, provocative form; i’ll go even further and say that it creates long-term threats to the society, security and even integrity of russia.it is painful for me to say this, but i must say it.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"today, russian society suffers from apparent deficit of spiritual values such as charity, empathy, compassion, support and mutual assistance.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"a deficit of things that have always, throughout our entire history, made us stronger and more powerful; these are the things we have always been proud of.we must wholeheartedly support the institutions that are the carriers of traditional values, which have historically proven their ability to pass these values from generation to generation.the law can protect morality and should do so, but a law cannot instil morality.",PAFA
Russia,2012,attempts by the government to encroach on people’s beliefs and views are a manifestation of totalitarianism.,PAFA
Russia,2012,this would be completely unacceptable to us and we do not plan to follow that path.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"we must not follow the path of prohibition and limitations, but instead, we must secure a firm spiritual and moral foundation for our society.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"that is precisely why issues of general education, culture and youth policy are so significant.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"these areas are not just a collection of services; rather, first and foremost, they are the environments for creating a moral, harmonious person, a responsible russian citizen.friends, we must acknowledge that schools’ influence on shaping children and adolescents has grown weaker in recent years.",PAFA
Russia,2012,they now have some powerful competitors: the internet and the electronic media.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"the parents and students themselves are now much more demanding and a school must not fall behind its students, the development of society, or the flow of information; instead, it should be well ahead of them all.",PAFA
Russia,2012,schools must regain their absolute value.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"this means renewing educational content, while of course maintaining our traditions and advantages, such as our fundamental mathematical education, without forgetting the enormous significance of high-quality education in the russian language, history, literature, the foundations of secular ethics and traditional religions.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"these subjects have a special role: they form a personality, an individual.whether or not a student comes across a talented, dedicated teacher largely determines the formation of his or her personality, his or her future.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"the education system must be built around strong, gifted teachers.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"such teachers should be selected scrupulously, taken care of and supported.",PAFA
Russia,2012,schools do not simply impart a set of knowledge.,PAFA
Russia,2012,i think you will agree with me that high-quality school training is impossible without education.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"i am asking the government cabinet to prepare a programme for the comprehensive development in schools of educational component, and it must above all be modern.we must promote technical and artistic creativity, establish summer sports camps and create special educational tourist routes for children.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"all this should be accessible to every child, regardless of where they live and how much their families earn.",PAFA
Russia,2012,let me point out that this falls under the direct responsibility of the russian federation’s regions.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"but clearly, the government must keep these matters under control.we should let the wealth of russian culture guide us.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"russia has always been among the nations that not only create their own cultural agenda, but also influence the entire global civilisation.",PAFA
Russia,2012,state policy in this area must aim to resolve current societal challenges.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"we must clearly understand and respond to the needs of modern society, particularly those of youth, and strengthen the traditions of the peoples of russia.our citizens who have made outstanding achievements in the creative sphere, in their work, business, sports and charity must be known in society and supported by the state.today, there are many people in russia who work selflessly on public charity projects.",PAFA
Russia,2012,the construction brigade movement is being revived.,PAFA
Russia,2012,i think it is important to support such volunteer initiatives.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"and soon, we will be discussing this in detail at a meeting with members of volunteer organisations.friends,in order to revive national consciousness, we need to link historical eras and get back to understanding the simple truth that russia did not begin in 1917, or even in 1991, but rather, that we have a common, continuous history spanning over one thousand years, and we must rely on it to find inner strength and purpose in our national development.we are nearing the end of 2012, which was declared the year of russian history.",PAFA
Russia,2012,but this attention to our nation’s history and related educational and scientific projects should not fade away.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"i am counting on the active work by the recently recreated russian historical society, as well as the russian military history society and the russian geographical society, which has been active now for several years.i would like to particularly thank the search parties that are restoring the names of heroes for our nation and for their families, honourably interring the remains of soldiers who fell in the great patriotic war and caring for war memorials.at our meetings with search party participants, we spoke about how important it is to preserve the historical military memory of the fatherland.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"after all, is it fair that we still do not have a single worthy national monument to the heroes of world war i?",PAFA
Russia,2012,"our predecessors called it the great war, but it was undeservingly forgotten and struck from our historical memory and history for political and ideological reasons.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"meanwhile, the morale of our armed forces is held up by traditions, by a living connection to history, by the examples of bravery and selflessness of our heroes.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"i feel that we should revive the names of the most renowned regiments, military units and major formations of past eras within the russian army – both from soviet times and earlier eras, such as preobrazhensky ans semenovsky regiments.",PAFA
Russia,2012,the defence minister should present corresponding suggestions.we must value the unique experience passed on to us by our forefathers.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"for centuries, russia developed as a multi-ethnic nation (from the very beginning), a civilisation-state bonded by the russian people, russian language and russian culture native for all of us, uniting us and preventing us from dissolving in this diverse world.to the rest of the planet, regardless of our ethnicity, we have been and continue to be one people.",PAFA
Russia,2012,i recall one of my meetings with veterans.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"there were representatives of several ethnicities: tatars, ukrainians, georgians, and ethnic russians of course.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"one of the veterans, who was not an ethnic russian, said, “as far as the entire world is concerned, we are one people, we are russians.”",PAFA
Russia,2012,"that was true during the war, and it has always been true.we treat and will continue to treat with great care and respect every ethnic group, every nation in the russian federation.",PAFA
Russia,2012,our diversity has always been and remains the source of our beauty and our strength.but we must not forget that any nationalism and chauvinism do direct and enormous damage especially to the people and the ethnic group whose interests the nationalists are supposedly defending.,PAFA
Russia,2012,that is why there is a grave danger for russia in all manifestations of “simple and definitive” solutions offered by the nationalists and extremists of various stripes and persuasions.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"whatever their slogans, they drag the country towards social decline and disintegration.",PAFA
Russia,2012,we must regard attempts to provoke ethnic tensions and religious intolerance as a challenge to the unity of the russian state and as a threat to all of us.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"we will not allow the emergence of closed ethnic enclaves in russia with their informal jurisdiction, existing outside the country’s common legal and cultural norms, and disdainfully disregarding the accepted standards, laws and regulations.i appeal to the heads of the republics of the russian federation, to the governors and mayors of major cities.",PAFA
Russia,2012,this is primarily your responsibility.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"you must work with people on a daily basis, and you must organise this effort to make it effective.russia needs new blood.",PAFA
Russia,2012,that much is clear.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"it needs smart, educated, hard-working people who do not just want to make some money here and leave, but want to move to russia, settle down here and consider this country their homeland.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"however, the current regulations do not contribute to this goal.",PAFA
Russia,2012,quite the contrary.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"the process of obtaining citizenship for our compatriots, for those who are culturally and spiritually close to russia is difficult and outrageously bureaucratic.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"at the same time it is very simple to import unskilled labour, including illegally.i ask you to develop a simplified procedure for granting russian citizenship to our compatriots, the bearers of the russian language and russian culture, the direct descendants of those who were born in the russian empire and the soviet union, for those who want to take up permanent residence in our country and, therefore, to give up their current citizenship.at the same time i consider it reasonable and necessary to toughen penalties against illegal immigration and violations of registration rules.",PAFA
Russia,2012,the relevant amendments have already been submitted to the state duma.,PAFA
Russia,2012,i ask the deputies to pass these laws.i would like to make another proposal.,PAFA
Russia,2012,we still allow citizens of cis states to enter the russian federation using their national passports.,PAFA
Russia,2012,enough time has passed and all cis states have become firmly established.,PAFA
Russia,2012,it is almost impossible to ensure effective immigration control when foreign citizens can enter the country using their national passports.,PAFA
Russia,2012,i believe that beginning from no later than 2015 entry into russia should only be possible for bearers of international passports.i ask the relevant agencies to work on this matter together with our colleagues in the commonwealth.,PAFA
Russia,2012,we do not want to create problems for anyone.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"if necessary, we can provide them with assistance and support, including financial and technical.",PAFA
Russia,2012,it is a simple matter of issuing documents.,PAFA
Russia,2012,we must adopt the practice of many of our neighbours and strategic partners around the world.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"we can provide technical and financial assistance, if needed.at the same time, the current regulations will remain in force for citizens of the customs union and common economic space, who will enjoy the simplified rules for crossing the border within the territory of the customs union and the common economic space.the role of public institutions is extremely important in immigration policy matters.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"in this regard, i consider it correct to broaden the powers of national and cultural autonomies, to provide them with federal grants for the implementation of programmes for the legal, social and cultural adaptation of immigrants.",PAFA
Russia,2012,this experience has shown to be effective in many countries.i also ask the government cabinet to submit proposals for the implementation of distance learning programmes in russian.,PAFA
Russia,2012,it should be available for young people in the cis and for our compatriots all over the world.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"it is important to support schools in the cis and in other states which teach in russian, including by providing support for the teachers, help with textbooks and equipment.",PAFA
Russia,2012,we should create a system of international school competitions in the russian language.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"the winners should be granted admission to the leading russian universities.colleagues, i would like to address especially those of you who work in this field.",PAFA
Russia,2012,i believe we should strive to ensure that quality education in russian is available globally.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"in general, we should talk about ways to expand russia’s presence in the global humanitarian, informational and cultural space.colleagues,democracy is the only political choice for russia.",PAFA
Russia,2012,i would like to stress that we share the universal democratic principles adopted worldwide.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"however, russia's democracy means the power of the russian people with their own traditions of self-rule and not the fulfilment of standards imposed on us from the outside.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"democracy means compliance with and respect for laws, rules and regulations.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"the ruling parties, governments and presidents may change but the core of the state and society, the continuity of national development, sovereignty and freedoms of people must remain intact.democracy is not only an opportunity to elect power, it’s about being able to monitor it and evaluate the results of its work.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"we must pay greater attention to the development of direct democracy and self-rule, including the right of popular legislative initiative (i have already talked about this), when an idea that receives public support, including via the internet, must be considered in parliament.in addition, i believe members of the federation council and state duma deputies must be given the right to initiate legislation in the regional legislatures.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"thus, we will strengthen the connection between federal laws and the life of the regions and each legislator.political competition is important for the country.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"at the same time, we must establish a kind of code of fair political competition.there are several points i would like to make in this regard.first.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"russia’s unity, integrity and sovereignty are unconditional.",PAFA
Russia,2012,any manifestations of separatism and nationalism must be completely removed from the political agenda.second.,PAFA
Russia,2012,any direct or indirect foreign interference in our internal political processes is unacceptable.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"anyone who receives money from abroad for his or her political activities, thus serving certain foreign national interests, cannot be a politician in the russian federation.third.",PAFA
Russia,2012,there can be no place in politics for criminals.,PAFA
Russia,2012,this should become standard practice for all political forces.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"of course, people will say that it is already against the law for criminals to take part in politics.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"yes, it is against the law but they still try to enter the political arena, sometimes receiving help, and this should not happen.fourth.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"civilised dialogue is possible only with those political forces that make, justify and articulate their demands in a civilised way, defending them in compliance with the law.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"the change and modernisation of the political system are natural and even necessary, but i have said in the past that it would be inadmissible to allow for the destruction of the state to satisfy this thirst for change.",PAFA
Russia,2012,the whole history of russia screams about it.fifth.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"the state must and will seek to ensure equal access to the media for all political parties, and not only during election campaigns but at all times.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"however, this is not an easy task, as i am sure you realise.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"we had seven political parties at the beginning of this year, and now we have 48, if i am not mistaken, plus there are over 200 organising committees working to establish their own political parties.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"nevertheless, the authorities must strive to ensure that all of them enjoy equal rights.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"many political parties and experts propose that we return to a mixed system of state duma elections – to party lists and single-mandate voting districts, which, of course, will have to be established first.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"i agree with this, let's go back to this system.some people talk about restoring the electoral blocs’ right to participate in elections.",PAFA
Russia,2012,let's think about this matter separately.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"it requires a detailed discussion, consideration and analysis.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"i am convinced that this can make our political system more fair, open and competitive, and will satisfy the society’s demand for new leaders in politics and the government, a demand for outstanding and independent people.colleagues,russia is characterised by a tradition of a strong state.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"therefore, the main public demands are addressed to the state: to guarantee civil rights and justice, to reduce violence and social inequality, to restore order in the housing and utilities sector, and so on.poor government efficiency and corruption are major problems that everyone can see.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"we will never be able to tackle the challenges facing our society and our nation without quality, modern public administration, and without a high level of personal responsibility of everyone involved in it.the following principles should be the key to the new model of public administration.first.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"all parts of the state mechanism and all levels of government must be oriented towards a result that is measurable, transparent and understandable to the public.second.",PAFA
Russia,2012,there must be extensive introduction of new forms and methods of control.,PAFA
Russia,2012,public opinion must become the main criterion for assessing the effectiveness of state bodies that provide public services as well as institutions in the social sphere.third.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"effective motivation of municipal employees: competitive salaries, a system of moral, financial and career incentives to encourage continuous improvement in the work of state bodies.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"at the same time, personal liability must be increased dramatically, up to and including temporary disqualification.this means that not only can an official found guilty of negligence be dismissed from office, but he or she can also be banned from engaging in this activity for a certain period of time.fourth.",PAFA
Russia,2012,when we criticise public officials i would like us to bear in mind that the vast majority of employees in various state bodies are honest and responsible people.,PAFA
Russia,2012,this is a special responsibility for those who take on a number of legal and ethical obligations and restrictions.,PAFA
Russia,2012,we must not forget that.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"but if a person has chosen public service, he or she should be ready for these restrictions, for public scrutiny and special requirements, as is the case in almost all countries around the world.",PAFA
Russia,2012,how can the public have confidence in an official or politician who says high-sounding words about the national good but at the same time tries to take his money and assets out of the country?,PAFA
Russia,2012,"i ask you to support legislative proposals limiting the rights of state officials and politicians to hold foreign accounts, stocks and shares.",PAFA
Russia,2012,(applause.),PAFA
Russia,2012,"hold your applause, you may not like what is coming.",PAFA
Russia,2012,(laughter.),PAFA
Russia,2012,"this requirement should apply to all officials who are in charge of key decisions: the top leaders of state and government, the senior staff in the presidential executive office and their immediate families.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"it should also apply to members of the federation council and state duma deputies.as for the ownership of foreign real estate, it must be declared in accordance with the law, and the official must submit a report on the cost of the property and the origin of the funds used to purchase it.fifth.",PAFA
Russia,2012,control over agencies exercising regulatory oversight requires special attention.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"according to various estimates, about one million people are employed in these bodies, which is comparable to the number of doctors or teachers in the country.i ask the government cabinet to submit proposals on ways to reshape the key functions of oversight agencies.",PAFA
Russia,2012,oversight is undoubtedly one of the key government functions.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"however, it is unacceptable when performance indicators for oversight agencies are not based on the result, but on the number of investigations.it is essential to introduce public reports by oversight agencies about the results of investigations, as well as the financial and human resources used to conduct them.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"that will clearly show the cost of each investigation and even whether it is necessary at all.we will certainly continue to combat corruption, which is a threat to national development prospects.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"i would like to stress that businesses must never enjoy any privileges based on their proximity to the executive, legislative or judicial government bodies at any level.in this regard, first, in addition to monitoring income and assets, we will also begin monitoring the expenditures and major acquisitions of civil servants, executives of state companies and their close relatives.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"at the same time, i want to point out that the prosecutor general’s office has now got the right to petition the courts to confiscate property that was acquired as the result of unlawful enrichment.furthermore, i believe that the level of remuneration for the executives of organisations financed through the state budget should be pegged to the organisation’s performance and the average salary of its employees.",PAFA
Russia,2012,we have already spoken about this many times.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"when we adopted new salary calculation principles a couple years ago, there were initially many disputes as to whether they should include mandatory principles or whether it would be enough to just set guidelines.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"but some guidelines were written, and yet ultimately, executives at some companies have salaries many times higher than the regular personnel.",PAFA
Russia,2012,this is wrong and this situation is to be changed.third.,PAFA
Russia,2012,state purchase contracts have become the current “breeding grounds” for corruption.,PAFA
Russia,2012,i am asking parliament to accelerate the passing of a law on the federal contract system.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"and it is exceedingly important to audit the efficacy and expediency of budgetary expenditures as well as purchases by the government and state companies, and instil public accountability for the process and results of fulfilling state orders.fourth.",PAFA
Russia,2012,the accounts chamber has significant instruments.,PAFA
Russia,2012,we expect much greater efficacy and professionalism from this institution.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"the ruling party, as well as the parliamentary opposition, should have the right to propose candidates for the post of chairperson, deputy chairperson, and auditors.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"at the same time, given the specifics of this type of work, it would be best to limit their tenure to two consecutive terms.fifth.",PAFA
Russia,2012,active civic participation and effective public monitoring are necessary conditions for effectively fighting corruption.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"today, many citizens are already building a system of public control at the municipal level on their own initiative, including for the housing and utilities sector.",PAFA
Russia,2012,we are obligated to support this this type of attitude.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"just recently, the day before yesterday, we spoke on this topic at a meeting with election campaign activists.the media also play a very important role in this work.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"that said, while we understand that the media operate in the market environment, they must not sell the objectivity of their information to the highest bidder; instead, their efforts must be based first and foremost on the interests of the entire society and on high moral principles.let me stress that the state’s moral authority is a fundamental prerequisite for russia’s development.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"therefore the policy to cleanup and renew state authorities at all levels will be firm and consistent.colleagues,we cannot be satisfied with today’s situation, when the russian budget, the social sector, are basically held hostage to the financial and commodities markets of other countries.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"a lopsided raw materials economy, as has been pointed out on many occasions, is not just vulnerable to external shocks.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"most importantly, it does not allow for developing and putting to adequate use human potential; it is incapable of giving most of our people the opportunity to make use of their strengths, talents, labour and education, which means, by definition, that it breeds inequality.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"finally, the capacities of the raw materials based economy model are exhausted while russia’s development needs require an annual gdp growth of no less than 5 or 6 percent over the next decade.at the same time, i am fully aware of the reality in which we live and i am familiar with the calculations and forecasts by the economic development ministry.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"nevertheless, it is important to set this high goal and strive toward achieving it.essential changes in the structure of the economy, the launch of new industries and regaining leadership in traditional industrial sectors, as well as the development of small and medium-sized businesses are key targets.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"i am confident that economic freedom, private property, competition and a modern market economy, rather than state capitalism, must be the core of a new growth model.our entrepreneurs are often criticised for lacking patriotism.",PAFA
Russia,2012,the high degree of offshore investments and ownerships in the russian economy is an absolute fact.,PAFA
Russia,2012,experts call this phenomenon fleeing from jurisdiction.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"according to some assessments, nine out of ten major transactions made by major russian companies are not regulated by russian laws – including, incidentally, companies with state participation.",PAFA
Russia,2012,we need a comprehensive system of measures to reverse the offshoring of our economy.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"i am instructing the government to make corresponding integrated proposals on this matter.we are to strive for offshore transparency, disclosure of tax information, as is done by many nations through negotiating with offshore zones and signing corresponding agreements.",PAFA
Russia,2012,all this can and should be done.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"nevertheless, if in choosing a jurisdiction, a foreign legislation is preferred, we then certainly must admit that we should improve the improper elements in our own judicial system, in our law-making, in our law enforcement practices.",PAFA
Russia,2012,only by admitting this honestly can we fundamentally change the situation.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"we have to carry out systemic work to improve our legislation, while refuting the presumption of guilt of businesses, the accusatory slant in our law enforcement and judicial practices, once and for all.we must eliminate all hitches in the legal system that allow turning economic disputes into score-settling through instigating contracted criminal cases.i want to thank the deputies of the state duma and members of the council of federation for their work on a package of amendments that are bringing order to this domain.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"thus, instituting criminal proceedings will not be allowed without a complaint filed by the damaged party regarding a variety of economic offences, while the penalties for policemen for tampering will be toughened.we should as soon as possible draft special laws to regulate administrative legal proceedings.",PAFA
Russia,2012,the supreme court president and i have discussed this in great detail several times.,PAFA
Russia,2012,we need to have juries to resolve the disputes between citizens and state authorities at all levels – this is a highly important objective that has still not been resolved.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"the opportunity to file collective lawsuits in the interest of an unlimited number of individuals, as well as lawsuits by public associations, will provide citizens with additional protection.",PAFA
Russia,2012,i ask that you accelerate the implementation of the corresponding amendments to the civil procedure code.another important issue.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"modern legislation, particularly financial and corporate legislation, is very specific.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"in this regard, i suggest that we work with partners to promote (or rather to complete, since it has already essentially begun but needs to be finished) the process of creating an arbitration court for the customs union, which can become a leading independent agency for examining financial and other disputes.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"overall, it is imperative to come up with a set of measures to develop arbitration proceedings in russia, at a qualitatively new level.i would also like to stress that the best way to make businesses patriotic is to ensure effective guarantees for protecting property and honouring contracts, and to make russia’s jurisdiction appealing.the state itself must show a good example of using russian jurisdiction, making a point of choosing russian platforms for the placement of state resources in privatisation transactions.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"incidentally, the privatisation the government intends to conduct should not have anything in common with the practices of the 1990s, the notorious loans-for-shares auctions.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"today’s privatisation should be based on the fair, transparent sale of state property at a just, realistic price.colleagues, the quality of privatisation is not just about money flowing into the state budget.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"it is, first and foremost, a question of society’s trust in the actions of the state; it is the emergence of a truly legitimate, respected proprietor.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"i am asking all government representatives who are responsible for conducting privatisation processes to remember this.businesses should work to achieve their own success as well as that of the nation; and should breed talented, sensible organisers, patrons and patriots, as was the case in earlier times in russia.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"it is then and only then that entrepreneurs will be able to gain widespread public respect.let me remind you that together with the business community, we began implementing a national entrepreneurial initiative.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"according to expert assessments, russia’s inclusion in the group of 20 nations with the best business climate will allow us to add no fewer than 2.5 percent to the current gdp growth rate, and the additional growth will be primarily in the non-raw materials sector, through small and medium-sized businesses.the most important factor in economic revival is the quality of the work done by regional authorities.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"we already have regions that have no oil or gas but, as you all know, show gdp growth of more than 10 percent per annum.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"incidentally, this is a good response to those who state that our growth rate can not be over 4 percent per year.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"here you go, you can easily add another 2 or 2.5 percent to that, and end up with 5 or 6 percent growth.we need cheap and longer-term money for financing the economy, for further suppressing inflation, for offering competitive bank rates.",PAFA
Russia,2012,i am asking the government and the central bank to think about mechanisms for addressing these challenges.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"i know very well that certain experts will disagree and i know what they will say, that providing longer-term money is not the central bank’s job, that this type of money is represented by citizens’ and companies’ savings, pension money and so on.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"yes, we all know this.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"but we also know that the federal reserve system of the united states, the european central bank, and certain other central banks have it written right in their charters that they are obligated to consider jobs and ensure the economy’s growth rate.i am not calling on you to review anything in our legislation right now; i am simply drawing your attention to the fact that we must all be concerned with the key issues of our nation’s development.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"our national savings must work in our country and for our country; at this time, however, very little of the national welfare fund’s resources are invested into national development.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"we came to an agreement (i remember this very well and i concur with it) that after the reserve fund surpasses 7 percent of the gdp, we can direct half of the surplus revenue into the russian economy, primarily toward infrastructure projects.now a few words about possible adjustments to our previous agreements, which i spoke about in the very beginning.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"by the end of this year, the reserve fund and the national welfare fund already amount to approximately 9 percent of gdp combined, which means that we will have a certain cushion of security in place.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"thus, beginning in 2013, after the establishment of a corresponding management entity, i suggest that some of the national welfare fund’s resources, perhaps about 100 billion rubles [3.3 billion dollars] (some experts think it should at least this amount) should be invested in russian securities and implementation of infrastructure projects.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"today, the government experts already agree with this.",PAFA
Russia,2012,so i am asking the finance ministry to produce a corresponding plan.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"it is important that such projects pay for themselves.i want to particularly stress the exceedingly important condition that they must be profitable and generate steady, guaranteed revenues, rather than requiring constant injections from the national welfare fund or the federal budget.the tax system must also correspond to the needs of economic restructuring.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"we shall encourage investment and development, and shift the tax burden towards consumption, including excise goods and luxury real estate.as a matter of fact, in many countries around the world and in russia we always come back to this issue, namely the question of income tax, in one way or another.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"i have already talked about this, you know my opinion: we must keep the so-called flat tax.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"even though a progressive tax might seem at first glance to be promoting social justice, in actual fact it does not.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"on the contrary, it will act as a burden for millions of citizens with average incomes.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"if you start to calculate what such a system will lead to, you’ll see that this will be the case.and on top of this, what else will happen?",PAFA
Russia,2012,tax evasion; both the budget and the treasury will find themselves lacking the funds this tax supposedly generates.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"this means that we will have budget shortfalls in financing for the army, pensions, and the public sector.",PAFA
Russia,2012,so that’s social justice.,PAFA
Russia,2012,therefore any action we take in this regard must be carried out extremely carefully.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"but here’s what we can do, what i think we must do, and what is also just: to impose additional taxes on so-called prestige, conspicuous consumption.i would remind the government that we must implement critical decisions relating to the so-called luxury tax already in the first half of 2013.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"this tax affects luxury properties and, no matter how harsh it might seem, expensive cars, even new ones.qualitative economic revival requires fair competition.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"as part of its efforts regarding national entrepreneurial initiative, i would instruct the government to adopt a so-called road map for enhancing competition and to implement it next year.why do i think that this simply must be done in all important fields?",PAFA
Russia,2012,"let me talk about this for a second, because i know very well how discussions go.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"they are usually sporadic: we talk about something important, confer, leave the conference room and forget about it, and the issue is put on hold.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"we need clear guidelines, we need documents we can track and whose implementation we can follow.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"i would ask you not to forget this and to make sure to do it.the core of our economic policy should be the competitiveness of all essential aspects of doing business in russia, from loan availability and tax incentives to comfortable administrative procedures and low inflation.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"this is almost a direct path to economic revival and to moving away from commodity dependence, because tens of thousands of new projects are becoming profitable.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"projects that involve processing raw materials, engineering, light and heavy industry, the service sector, small and medium businesses and, of course, the agricultural sector.a few words about agriculture.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"demand for food is growing rapidly all over the world, especially in developing countries.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"as you know, russia has more than half of the world’s arable land, 55 percent.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"in the next four to five years we must fully ensure our independence in all major types of food production, and russia must then become the world’s largest producer of food.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"this will open up huge new opportunities for us.we also should pay very close attention to environmental issues, and the environmental rehabilitation of various regions.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"in fact, we have already started working in some areas, such as the arctic.our reference points are high quality environmental standards of development.we intend to take full advantage of unprecedented funds allocated for defence procurement and modernisation of the defence industry in order to upgrade that industry, and to develop science and technology.",PAFA
Russia,2012,almost all sectors of the russian economy will benefit from these funds via the implementation of related orders.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"we must strengthen our position in space, nuclear energy, revive key sectors such as aviation, shipbuilding, instrumentation, and establish them on a new foundation, at a new level, based on new technologies.we have begun to rebuild our national electronic industry, and done so with the active participation of private capital.",PAFA
Russia,2012,i believe that we need to prepare a road map for the development of new industries similar to the road maps for improving the investment climate.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"these industries include rare earth metals and composites, biotechnology and genetic engineering, it, new urban planning, engineering, and industrial design.a long-term prognosis for russia’s scientific and technological development through to 2030 is currently being finalised.",PAFA
Russia,2012,it highlights specific ways to both revitalise traditional sectors and to penetrate new high-tech markets.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"a special fund for promising research on the defence technologies of the future will be established.colleagues,imbalances between regional development, the labour market, and the social sphere are direct consequences of a commodity-based economy.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"as a rule, finding a job today with a decent salary is only possible in moscow and st petersburg or in resource-rich regions, and quality education and medical care is only available in several major cities.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"this is where people go to work, study, receive medical treatment, this is where young people want to go, and therefore other regions lose active citizens willing to work and be of value.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"imperatives of our time include a decisive step towards decentralised development, a new geography of economic growth and the labour market, new industries and new centres for industry, science, and education, a new, modern social environment in all russian regions, cities, and towns, including a barrier-free environment for individuals with limited abilities.at present the difference between regional incomes is extremely high.",PAFA
Russia,2012,you are well aware that ten regions generate more than half of russia’s revenues.,PAFA
Russia,2012,we must consistently work to ensure that all russian regions without exception become economically self-sufficient and subjects of the federation in the fullest sense.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"therefore, we must slightly change the current logic of relations among state budgets at various levels.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"may the finance ministry not be frightened by these words.we should create and strengthen the economic base of our regions, and help those who are working proactively there.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"one priority measure at the municipal level involves the reallocation of the bulk of taxes collected from small businesses, currently working under a special tax regime, to municipalities.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"in addition, we are eliminating many federal tax breaks for the properties and land of various legal entities.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"these funds will also flow into regional and local budgets.however, i now address the government first of all since you know what i’m referring to, we will get rid of the tax breaks for infrastructure companies and infrastructure monopolies, among others.",PAFA
Russia,2012,this means that they will have to pay more.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"but not everyone is ready to start paying new amounts, because at that point we could completely deprive them of investment possibilities.",PAFA
Russia,2012,we have already agreed on a smooth transition period and compensation for these companies.,PAFA
Russia,2012,we absolutely must think about this.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"such decisions are not taken casually, though of course it is necessary to move in this direction, and we will do so.i also believe that as of 2014 regions should receive the right to tax real estate based on its cadastral value, and this would strengthen a given region’s tax base.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"but this must be the regions’ own choice, and along with this we must finish all work related to evaluating properties and verifying data about their owners.i want to stress that we have to examine in detail all aspects of russia’s balanced regional development, including education.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"it would be correct to provide priority support to those universities working in the regions and cooperating with major companies there, companies with which they promote research and development.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"already during their studies the graduates of these universities are linking their futures to the places where they live and study.we are to create more publically-funded places in precisely these universities, and the government must support their development programmes.",PAFA
Russia,2012,along with this it is essential that business takes part in the management and funding of these universities.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"among other things, the above will stop the practice whereby a lot of resources are spent on training students in moscow and st petersburg, students who do not even plan to work in their field of training.we need a kind of investment map of russia, providing investors with clear information about which regions are more profitable, better to work in, to set up production facilities, and what forms of state support will be available to businesses in the near future.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"by using our competitive advantages we should encourage production to migrate from other russian regions, just as we are currently doing in the automotive industry.",PAFA
Russia,2012,just yesterday i met with the ceo of one of the world's largest companies in this field.we are currently moving in this direction.,PAFA
Russia,2012,this is helped by the fact that russia's wto accession gives us the opportunity to relocate production to russia that is designed not only for the domestic market but also for export.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"in the 21st century, the vector of russia’s development will be the development of the east.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"siberia and the far east represent our enormous potential, as [mikhail] lomonosov once put it.",PAFA
Russia,2012,and now we must realise our potential.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"we have the opportunity to assume a worthy place in the asia-pacific region, the most dynamic region in the world.just recently at a state council presidium meeting we discussed in detail specific steps to stimulate economic growth in the trans-baikal and far eastern regions.",PAFA
Russia,2012,i will not repeat everything that we agreed to do.,PAFA
Russia,2012,but one of things we agreed on was creating attractive living conditions there.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"by the end of the first quarter of 2013, the government must work out in detail its proposed measures, including tax breaks for so-called start-ups (new businesses), plans for the development of energy, infrastructure and so on.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"this must absolutely be done, and i would ask you to pay you utmost attention to this task.in addition, i would ask the government to submit proposals concerning the future development of kaliningrad region, especially since the law on special economic zones will expire in 2016.",PAFA
Russia,2012,we need a real breakthrough in the construction of roads.,PAFA
Russia,2012,in the coming decade we should at least double current rates of road building.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"here too different calculations exist, but it is absolutely correct to consider that current figures must double.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"our most important development priority is regional aviation, as well as seaports, the northern sea route, the baikal-amur mainline (bam), the trans-siberian railway, and other transit corridors.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"it is not enough to simply think about all of this, we must work hard in all these cases.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"we have to ensure the unity of russia’s entire territory, in the full sense of transport connectivity.dear friends,the main feature of the present era is that no one can solve global economic and political problems alone.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"in fact, this has always been the case, in the 1990s as well.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"even though quite recently, ten years ago, some people thought that the world had become unipolar; some of my former colleagues told me so at the time.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"today, no one thinks so.it is absolutely obvious to everyone that the modern world is becoming increasingly multipolar.",PAFA
Russia,2012,this creates both risks and opportunities.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"risks will prevail when each player plays their own game, if they are not relieved of the illusion that it is possible to manage chaos (you know there is such a theory).",PAFA
Russia,2012,"and if people stop sowing such chaos, risks will not prevail.russia stands for the principles of coherent and collective efforts in addressing challenges facing the world today.",PAFA
Russia,2012,this position is absolutely consistent with contemporary realities.,PAFA
Russia,2012,we propose projects that will unite nations and regions.,PAFA
Russia,2012,the experience and reality of the past 20 years as well as simple common sense put everything into its true place.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"and it is natural that interest in integration is growing in america (both north and south america), in europe, and in asia, and these processes are gaining momentum.",PAFA
Russia,2012,why should we remain on the sidelines?,PAFA
Russia,2012,"on the contrary, together with our immediate neighbours we must make use of all our advantages.our immediate neighbours are also showing more interest in integration processes.",PAFA
Russia,2012,one example of this was their very practical and pragmatic approach to developing and adopting the agreement on the cis free trade zone.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"by the way, i am grateful to our parliamentarians who were the first to ratify this very important document.we will move towards closer integration.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"this is exemplified by the customs union and the common economic space of russia, belarus and kazakhstan, which are already functioning effectively.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"we have begun to establish the eurasian economic union, and naturally we will continue to work at this and achieve this goal.dear colleagues and citizens of russia,we had set ourselves the goal of doubling our gdp and by the end of 2008 we were very close, somewhere in the range of an 80 to 85 percent increase.",PAFA
Russia,2012,it was only the global crisis that slowed our momentum.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"and yet there was a reason we set such a high bar for ourselves, such a difficult challenge.",PAFA
Russia,2012,russia’s economy has demonstrated its ability to grow quickly and qualitatively.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"we were able to maintain and strengthen our development potential, and to set its new horizons.what do i want to say?",PAFA
Russia,2012,"using 1999 as a benchmark, our gdp per capita has almost doubled.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"federal and consolidated budgets have increased, not by a certain number of percentage points, but by 2.6 times.",PAFA
Russia,2012,public debt in relation to gdp decreased almost tenfold.,PAFA
Russia,2012,it went from more than 100 percent of gdp (i think it was about 120 to 125 percent) to 10 and some percent.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"moreover, our external debt fell to 2.5 percent.",PAFA
Russia,2012,the rate of inflation fell sixfold: in 1999 it was 36.5 percent and in 2011 6.1 percent.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"this year it will increase a little but remain less than 7 percent, at approximately 6.5 percent.by 2000 russia's population had declined (just think about these numbers, you know them well but i would like to remind you of this tragedy), and was declining by a million people almost every year.",PAFA
Russia,2012,and it seemed that the disaster could not be stopped.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"at the time, demographic forecasts seemed like the country’s final judgment.but we were able to reverse this destructive trend.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"launching demographic programmes allowed russia's population to stabilise, as i already said, and begin to grow as of 2010.",PAFA
Russia,2012,this represents our crucial achievement.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"i want to draw your attention to this, and not to say: “oh, look at how great we are!”",PAFA
Russia,2012,no.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"i stress this so that we understand that people believed us, and changed their planning horizons accordingly.",PAFA
Russia,2012,they believed that stability is essential for development and the improvement of living conditions.,PAFA
Russia,2012,i say this because we should value such trust and take it into account in our work.all growth rates i mentioned bear witness to enormous changes in both economic and social development.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"but the main thing is that we – as a country, a society, and citizens – can all overcome hardship and resolve significant problems.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"and we must remember that we have accomplished this difficult journey in commendable fashion, and achieved our goals step by step.we have a lot of work ahead of us, and such work is always required if we want to move forward.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"and we need everyone’s contribution today, not tomorrow.why do i cite these figures?",PAFA
Russia,2012,"our country has historically had an attitude to life that involves living for the future, for our children.",PAFA
Russia,2012,of course this is a very important and noble task and purpose.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"but it seems as if one’s own prosperous life is always being delayed, postponed, and postponed for the future.",PAFA
Russia,2012,"and this was almost always the case in russia, for all generations.",PAFA
Russia,2012,but let me go back once again to the reason i cited these figures: the time has come to drastically improve our situation.,PAFA
Russia,2012,we are doing this and we can do it.,PAFA
Russia,2012,"if we continue consistent national development policies, harness our development to common creative work, if we work with dignity and spare no efforts, then we will achieve our goals and accomplish all the tasks before us.thank you for your patience and attention.(",PAFA
Russia,2012,the national anthem of the russian federation.),PAFA
Russia,2013,"citizens of russia, members of the council of federation and the state duma,the president’s state-of-the-nation annual address to the federal assembly is a requirement set forth in the russian constitution, that which is exactly 20 years old today.",PAFA
Russia,2013,i congratulate you on this important date for our state and our society.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"and of course, i also congratulate you on the 20th anniversary of the federal assembly, russia’s parliament, which was created in accordance with the provisions of our country’s basic law.our constitution brings together two fundamental priorities – the supreme value of rights and freedoms of citizens and a strong state, emphasising their mutual obligation to respect and protect each other.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"i am convinced that the constitutional framework must be stable, above all in what concerns its second chapter, which defines the rights and freedoms of individuals and citizens.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"these provisions of our fundamental law are inviolable.but life does not stand still, and no constitutional process can ever be regarded as finally completed or dead.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"targeted amendments to other constitutional chapters, deriving from law enforcement practices and from life itself, naturally are possible and sometimes necessary.you know that we have proposed to amend the constitution and to unite the supreme court and higher arbitration court.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"today these courts often differ, sometimes quite substantially, in their interpretation of various laws.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"sometimes they take different decisions in similar cases, and sometimes they agree.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"this results in legal uncertainty, and at times in injustices that affect concrete people.i believe that unifying these courts will allow us to bring judicial practice onto one track, and therefore strengthen the guarantees protecting a crucial constitutional principle, the equality of all before the law.colleagues,the constitution contains crucial unifying national ideas.the meaning of its provisions on the welfare state consists in the mutual responsibility linking the state, society, the business community, and every russian citizen.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"we must support the growing desire of citizens, representatives of public and professional associations, political parties, and the business class to participate in our country’s life.among other things we must support civic activism at the local level, in communities, so that people get a real opportunity to participate in managing their village or town, to deal with everyday issues that actually determine their quality of life.today quite a few problems have accumulated within our local self-government system.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"unfortunately, and you know it well, the responsibilities incumbent on municipalities and their resources are not evenly balanced.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"this often leads to confusion regarding their authorities, which are not only blurred, but are constantly thrown from one level of government to another: from districts to regions, from towns to districts and back again.",PAFA
Russia,2013,local self-government authorities are being constantly shaken by corruption scandals.the powers at the district level have been significantly watered down.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"those that existed in education, healthcare, and social welfare have been transferred to the regional level of government.in addition, local authority – because it is the closest power to the people – should be organised so that any citizen could reach out to it, figuratively speaking.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"in this connection i am addressing the all-russian council for local self-government development, all-russian congress of municipalities, governors, and members of the federal assembly, of the government of the russian federation – let’s comprehensively go over these issues again and finally bring the situation in line with common sense and attune it to the times.let me repeat: i think the most important task is to clarify the general principles of local self-government organisation, develop strong, independent, financially sustainable local authorities.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"and we need to start this work and give it sound legal foundations already next year, 2014, the year of the 150th anniversary of the famous zemstvo reform of 1864.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"incidentally, at the time it was precisely the development of zemstvos, of local self-government that enabled russia to make a breakthrough and find competent people capable of implementing major progressive reforms, including pyotr stolypin’s agrarian reform and the restructuring of industry during the first world war.i am sure that today as well strong local self-government can become a powerful resource for enhancing and renewing our country’s human resource potential.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"and of course, we are all interested in ensuring that elections bring to power qualified, motivated, professional people who are ready to perform their duties responsibly.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"for this reason we shall continue to work on developing the political competition, improving political institutions, and creating conditions for them to be more open and efficient.recent elections demonstrated that today there is less officialdom, bureaucracy, and predictable results in our political life.",PAFA
Russia,2013,i consider it important that many new parties have made their presence felt.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"by winning seats in municipal and regional bodies, they have laid a good foundation for participating in upcoming federal election campaigns.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"i am sure that they will act as worthy competitors to longstanding political actors.today’s russia requires broad public debate that would yield practical results, when public initiatives become part of public policy, while society monitors their execution.i think that all draft bills, key government decisions, and strategic plans should pass a so-called initial public reading involving ngos and other civil society institutions.both the federal and regional executive authorities must establish public councils.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"of course many such councils already exist within various levels of authority, but they are not everywhere.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"and most importantly, these councils should not be formal or decorative structures.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"on the contrary, they should act as expert groups, and sometimes as the government’s constructive opponents, and be active participants in anti-corruption efforts.i would ask the civic chamber, the human rights council and other non-governmental and human rights organisations to be actively involved in drafting the bill on public oversight that would establish the legal basis for such civic participation.supporting the human rights movement should be a priority of joint work between the state and society.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"we expect that such organisations will not act in a way that is politically biased, and that they will engage as closely as possible with the interests and concerns of every citizen, every individual.in this context, the role of the civic chamber is increasing.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"it must become a platform where various professional and social groups, associations, and unions can express their interests.",PAFA
Russia,2013,more professionals should be involved in this work.,PAFA
Russia,2013,i believe that members of these unions must compose at least half of the civic chamber’s members proposed by the president.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"such an approach would balance the interests of different social and professional groups, and enable the chamber to be more responsive to their concerns.the most important topic requiring frank discussion in our society today is interethnic relations.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"this one topic concentrates many of our problems: challenges relating to socio-economic and regional development, corruption, shortcomings in the work of public institutions, and of course failures in educational and cultural policies, which often produce a distorted understanding of the true causes of interethnic tensions.such tensions are not provoked by representatives of particular nationalities, but by people devoid of culture and respect for traditions, both their own and those of others.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"they represent a kind of amoral international, which comprises rowdy, insolent people from certain southern russian regions, corrupt law enforcement officials who cover for ethnic mafias, so-called russian nationalists, various kinds of separatists who are ready to turn any common tragedy into an excuse for vandalism and bloody rampage.together we must rise to the challenge; we must safeguard interethnic peace and thus the unity of our society, the unity and integrity of the russian state.colleagues,the may 2012 executive orders contain specific measures designed to ensure the country’s dynamic development in all fields.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"in fact, the orders amounted to a unified action programme, reflecting the will of millions of people, the desire of all russian people for a better life.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"sometimes we hear that there are insufficient funds to realise all stated plans and goals, that we need to lower our standards and simplify our tasks.colleagues, let me turn to a very important subject with profound implications.",PAFA
Russia,2013,i think that it is impossible to elaborate policies following a formal approach.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"yes, of course we all know that economic trends may and do change.",PAFA
Russia,2013,but that is no reason to talk about revising our goals.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"we need to do real work, seek solutions, and clearly lay out budgetary and other priorities.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"i would ask you to update all state programmes accordingly.already within the next two years, all budgets should be changed to conform to our budget plan.",PAFA
Russia,2013,this does not mean rewriting everything mechanically.,PAFA
Russia,2013,it means increasing the personal responsibility of each manager for the achievement of results.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"what we need to do is to focus resources on achieving substantial changes in specific sectors.for this reason we are raising salaries in education and healthcare so that the work of teachers, professors, and doctors becomes prestigious once again, and attracts strong university graduates.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"but as we agreed, decent wages must not only reflect budgetary transfers, but rather reforms designed to improve spending efficiency and, most importantly, the quality of social services.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"we need people to see how our schools, universities, clinics and hospitals are changing for the better.therefore, in addition to increasing salaries, which certainly needs to be done, and we will do it, we must also implement a whole set of other measures to ensure that all our objectives are met.",PAFA
Russia,2013,what are those measures?,PAFA
Russia,2013,"they include transitioning to the use of an effective contract and the certification of specialists, as well as implementing per capita financing, when establishments (both state and private ones, which is very important) providing services of the highest quality receive special benefits.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"this means developing real competition, opening the public sector to ngos and socially-oriented businesses.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"it certainly means optimising the budget institution network by reducing ineffective expenditures and components, and removing barriers that prevent public institutions from working independently.what is happening with all these measures?",PAFA
Russia,2013,a year and a half has passed since the executive orders were issued.,PAFA
Russia,2013,you know what i’m seeing?,PAFA
Russia,2013,"either things are being done in a way that elicits a negative reaction among the public, or nothing is done at all.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"clearly, we will fail to achieve our stated goals with this kind of work.it is taking us a long time to make these changes – an unacceptably long time.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"as a result, consumers of these services do not perceive any fundamental changes.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"we are allocating enormous resources, but if we do not hold reforms, instead of an improved quality, we will only see an increase in inefficient expenditures that inflate the administrative apparatus, which is what often happens in practice.",PAFA
Russia,2013,i want to draw the federal and regional authorities’ attention to this.one very important challenge is to create a system for independently appraising the quality of social institutions.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"this mechanism will allow their funding to be linked to their performance, which means effectively optimising the budget institution network.i believe that we need direct application laws that will establish common approaches, standards and criteria, as well as responsibilities at all levels of government, to create a system for independently appraising the performance of organisations in the social sector.",PAFA
Russia,2013,i am asking you to adopt a corresponding law in the upcoming spring session.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"colleagues, this is an urgent request.in recent years, we have been able to achieve a great deal in the healthcare sector.",PAFA
Russia,2013,life expectancy has gone up.,PAFA
Russia,2013,mortality from cardiovascular and many other types of diseases has gone down.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"however, we are still far from our target indicators.the big question that remains is a realistic approach to the insurance principle in healthcare.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"today, the function of mandatory health insurance is essentially to “pump money” to the recipient through the extra-budgetary fund rather than the budget.",PAFA
Russia,2013,the objective is entirely different.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"the objective is for the insurance principle to work as an incentive for people to take responsibility for their health, to have financial incentives to live a healthy lifestyle, and for insurance companies to be interested in medical institutions providing high-quality services, so that a patient finally has the opportunity to select the medical institution that, in his or her opinion, works best.the mandatory health insurance system should fully financially cover state guarantees for providing free medical assistance.",PAFA
Russia,2013,this applies equally to the total spending volume and directing funding to a specific hospital or clinic.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"at the same time, the patient should clearly understand which healthcare services he or she is entitled to receive free of charge, and the doctor should understand the principles upon which his or her work is paid.particular emphasis should be placed on developing a preventive treatment system.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"beginning in 2015, all children and teenagers must have a yearly mandatory free medical check-up, while adults should undergo such an examination every three years.clearly, there will be an increase in disease detection during routine medical examinations, and the need for high-tech medical care will grow.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"in recent years, we have created a whole network of federal centres, supporting ones that are located in major cities, but also creating a new federal network of centres capable of providing medical assistance at the most advanced level.",PAFA
Russia,2013,we need to maintain and develop their potential.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"at the same time, services at these centres must be accessible not just to the residents of the cities where they are located, but also residents of other regions.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"we must provide the necessary financial resources for that.on the whole, over the next three years, we must create the conditions to perform 50% more high-tech operations than today.",PAFA
Russia,2013,this is an entirely achievable goal.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"at the same time, we cannot fall behind the global trends.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"leading nations already stand at the threshold of implementing medical technologies built on bio- and genetic engineering, based on the human genome sequence.",PAFA
Russia,2013,this will truly revolutionise medicine.,PAFA
Russia,2013,i believe that the healthcare ministry and the russian academy of sciences should make fundamental and applied medical research a priority.we must greatly increase the professional community’s role in managing the healthcare system.,PAFA
Russia,2013,i am aware that there are some ideas in this area that deserve support.,PAFA
Russia,2013,i am asking the health ministry to work with leading healthcare worker associations to submit concrete proposals.we must also revive our traditions of charity.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"i propose that we organise a nationwide movement for volunteers who want to work within the healthcare system, providing what assistance they can.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"i believe that volunteers who have spent several years working in healthcare institutions should have priority admission to medical schools.colleagues,the year 2014 has been declared the year of culture in russia.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"it is intended to be a year of enlightenment, emphasis on our cultural roots, patriotism, values and ethics.we are aware of the all-encompassing, unifying role of russian culture, history and language for our multi-ethnic population, and we must build our state policy with this in mind, including in education.we need schools that do more than just teach; teaching is very important –most important, in fact – but we also need schools to help our nation’s citizens form their identity, absorbing the nation’s values, history and traditions.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"we need open-minded individuals with a strong internalised knowledge of culture, capable of thinking creatively and independently.instructions have already been given that starting from the next academic year, a mandatory essay-based final exam will be introduced for graduating high school students.",PAFA
Russia,2013,the results of this exam will be taken into consideration alongside the national final school exam when applying to universities and other educational institutions.teachers’ professional development will be crucial to the future of russian schools.,PAFA
Russia,2013,teachers must be ready to use modern technology and know how to work with children that have health-related disabilities.,PAFA
Russia,2013,i ask you to prepare an integrated programme for upgrading school staff.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"i know that the education ministry is already working on this, and is developing a system of life-long training and professional development for teachers.",PAFA
Russia,2013,we must complete the work on this programme.there is another problem that requires urgent resolution.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"even today, many schools operate with two shifts.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"this is true for nearly one quarter of russian schools, and nearly half of schools in cities use this system.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"thanks to positive demographic growth, the number of students in russian schools will grow by a million in the next five to six years.i ask the cabinet, the federal assembly and regional authorities: we must assess the scale of this problem and provide effective solutions, which should include building preschools in such a way that in the future, they can be used as elementary schools as well.this should not lead to an increase in the cost of preschool construction projects.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"we can consider the option of building schools and preschools under one roof, as a single campus.of course, let me stipulate that this is not the federal government’s responsibility.",PAFA
Russia,2013,this responsibility falls on the regional and even local authorities.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"nevertheless, we need to understand the scale of the problem.",PAFA
Russia,2013,we cannot brush it aside.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"if it has enormous significance for our nation and takes on these forms, i do not think we will be able to address it without federal support.naturally, we must continue developing a wide array of sports infrastructure for children and teenagers.",PAFA
Russia,2013,we must do everything to increase the popularity of active lifestyles.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"indeed, that was the main idea behind the universiade that was successfully held in kazan and the olympic games in sochi, which will open very soon.i am confident that we will do an excellent job of organising the olympics in sochi, the 2018 fifa world cup and the winter universiade in krasnoyarsk.colleagues,the statistics from january through october of this year show that russia has experienced natural population growth.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"this is the first time we are seeing such results since 1991, and it is a very positive indicator.the birth rate exceeded mortality in almost half of russia’s regions, and it surpassed the national average in all regions in the urals and siberia, and most volga and far eastern regions.but we need to understand something else as well.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"right now, the generation born in the 1990s is beginning to start families of their own – this is the generation from the time when the decline in birth rates was the greatest, when it was catastrophic.",PAFA
Russia,2013,we must make a special effort to ensure that the positive population growth remains irreversible.i remind you that the birth rate in our country reached one of its highest figures in the late 1980s.,PAFA
Russia,2013,housing construction also peaked at this time.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"today, housing construction must once again play a decisive part in encouraging population growth in russia.the government has already drafted the policy measures needed to implement the programme for building affordable housing.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"this programme will see the construction of at least 25 million square metres of new housing, complete with the corresponding social infrastructure, by 2017, so that middle-income families can improve their housing situation.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"i propose that we call this programme housing for russia’s families, so as to focus attention on this side of the issue.overall, by 2016, we will need to pass the 75-million square-metre mark, which is higher than the record set in 1987, when 72.8 million square metres of housing were built.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"modern technology allows us to build a lot of relatively cheap and quality housing, but there are several problems we need to resolve on the way.above all, we need to finally make all the legal amendments that will clear the way for making land plots available for housing construction.",PAFA
Russia,2013,this must be done within the coming months.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"this is a subject we are always discussing, and we have come back to this issue many times over these last weeks.the local government authorities will have the task of organising bids for land plots under clear and transparent procedures.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"developers will also have greater responsibility: if they receive the land but do not begin construction according to schedule, they will have to return the land.",PAFA
Russia,2013,another barrier that is holding back construction is the lack of funds for providing land plots with the necessary engineering infrastructure.,PAFA
Russia,2013,we will need to develop specially-designed instruments to resolve this and work out the financing sources and organisational form.,PAFA
Russia,2013,i know that at the tax authorities’ initiative the government is drafting proposals on bringing order to online trade.,PAFA
Russia,2013,this could also become a source of funding for developing engineering infrastructure.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"i ask you to make proposals on this matter.finally, we need to put the situation with permit procedures in order.",PAFA
Russia,2013,these procedures are still not standardised.,PAFA
Russia,2013,i ask you to draft a single and exhaustive list of all permits required for construction and reduce the time it takes to go through the necessary procedures as much as possible.,PAFA
Russia,2013,i would like you to do this by the end of march 2014.,PAFA
Russia,2013,we all know why this work is not making progress and why problems have not been settled to this day.,PAFA
Russia,2013,it is because there is a lot of corruption in this sector.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"this is where the root of the problem lies.colleagues,we all know that renewed, sustained economic growth is the essential condition for achieving our social development goals.",PAFA
Russia,2013,this brings me to the heart of our work.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"of course we are feeling the effects of the global economic crisis, but let’s be frank: the main reasons for the slowdown in our economy are internal rather than external in nature.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"in terms of the size of its gdp, russia is doing well and counts among the world’s five biggest economies.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"but in key indicators such as labour productivity, there is a two- to three-fold gap between us and the developed economies.",PAFA
Russia,2013,we must work hard to close this gap.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"to do this, we must make full use of all new development factors.",PAFA
Russia,2013,what are these factors?,PAFA
Russia,2013,we all know them well.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"they include high quality professional education and a flexible labour market, a good investment climate and modern technology.i ask the government, together with the russian academy of sciences, to make adjustments to the programme of priority areas for science and technology development.",PAFA
Russia,2013,the recently created russian scientific fund will also need to organise its work in line with these priorities.,PAFA
Russia,2013,the fund’s purpose is to finance fundamental research and programmes with a long-term implementation timeframe.,PAFA
Russia,2013,i consider this work to be of national importance.the leaders of the parliamentary parties voiced their proposals on taking part in russia’s innovative development at recent meetings held in preparation for today’s address.,PAFA
Russia,2013,you all voted for the law that established the russian scientific fund.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"i propose that all of the parliamentary parties send their representatives to the russian scientific fund’s board of trustees.as for applied research, it should be based around technology platforms.",PAFA
Russia,2013,i propose that targeted programmes such as research and development in priority science and technology fields refocus their funding on supporting this kind of applied research.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"it is also important at the same time to ensure co-financing of projects from state and private sector sources.at the moment, only one out of every 265 scientific results obtained becomes protected by the law.",PAFA
Russia,2013,added-value contribution to russia’s gdp from intellectual property turnover comes to less than 1 percent.,PAFA
Russia,2013,this is not just a low figure – it is a very paltry figure indeed.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"in the united states, this figure is 12 percent, in germany 7–8 percent, and in finland, our neighbour, it is 20 percent.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"technology platforms must therefore focus on concrete results, getting patents and licenses, and getting their developments into actual practical use.",PAFA
Russia,2013,we must develop internal demand for advanced technology.,PAFA
Russia,2013,it is absolutely crucial to have demand for advanced technology from within the country.,PAFA
Russia,2013,we must use the public procurement system and state company investment programmes to help encourage this demand.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"these sources represent a lot of money, trillions of roubles.",PAFA
Russia,2013,we must also carry out a thorough stock-taking of our development institutions.,PAFA
Russia,2013,their activities have become fragmented of late between numerous disparate projects that are not always directly related to innovation.,PAFA
Russia,2013,that was not our objective when we established these development institutions.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"this is not to say that these projects are without merit, but the institutions were set up specifically to support the economy’s innovation development.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"we must reset their strategic focus back on technology breakthroughs.in order to rid our economy of outdated, inefficient and harmful technology, we must finally put together a modern technical and environmental regulation system.",PAFA
Russia,2013,this is a very complicated and sensitive matter for the economy.,PAFA
Russia,2013,i hope that the government will work energetically together with the business community and with our colleagues in the customs union to carry out this work.,PAFA
Russia,2013,i also propose that we establish a statistical evaluation system for the technology situation in the different economic sectors so as to gain an objective picture of our competitiveness.,PAFA
Russia,2013,a system of this kind worked during the soviet period.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"that old system was scrapped, but nothing was developed in its place.",PAFA
Russia,2013,we now need to develop a new system.,PAFA
Russia,2013,the next task is support for the non-raw materials export sectors.,PAFA
Russia,2013,this support system has still not begun working in full.,PAFA
Russia,2013,many administrative barriers remain in place.,PAFA
Russia,2013,it takes more than 20 days to get an export permit.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"in comparison, it takes 6 days in the united states, and in canada or south korea it takes 8 days.",PAFA
Russia,2013,these are all issues that need to be addressed in a new roadmap for supporting exports.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"i ask the government, together with the strategic initiatives agency, to draft this roadmap by march 1, 2014.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"colleagues, new professional standards play a crucial part in quality economic development.",PAFA
Russia,2013,these standards must set the qualification demands that professionals in the different sectors should meet.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"but they will work only if they meet the demands of business itself, and they must therefore be developed with the professional communities’ involvement.",PAFA
Russia,2013,i propose establishing a national professional qualifications council.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"rather than being attached to a government body, it would be a truly independent organisation.",PAFA
Russia,2013,the main business organisations and professional associations should be involved in its work.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"over a two-year period, this council will have the task of approving the entire package of new professional standards.",PAFA
Russia,2013,i ask our colleagues from the business community and from the associations i just mentioned not to shirk their part in this work.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"after all, it is in your own interests to get involved.the entire professional education system should be reorganised so as to fit with the new standards and their demands.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"there is much in our own experience that we can draw on here, updating it for today’s needs.",PAFA
Russia,2013,i am thinking here of things such as professional and workplace-related training right from school and technical higher education centres set up by big industrial companies.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"the main principle is to have on-the-job training so that theory is reinforced by practical skills and experience.a few words separately on the subject of higher education, most young people want to get higher education, and the quality of our universities must measure up to this demand.",PAFA
Russia,2013,only in this way can we really turn our young people’s education drive into a powerful force for our country’s development.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"but today, both in the capitals and in the regions, there are still many universities that do not meet modern demands.i think that in order to reinvigorate the entire higher education system, we must make use of our best universities’ potential by delegating to them the power to evaluate education quality and help to ensure that graduates’ knowledge and skills will be needed in the labour market and will bring our economy and society real returns.in no circumstances must we create barriers for educational mobility.",PAFA
Russia,2013,this also concerns the cost of student residences.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"the prices here should not be excessive in any way, but must be directly linked to the living conditions and services provided.",PAFA
Russia,2013,i ask the ministry of education and science and the student organisations to strictly monitor the situation here.,PAFA
Russia,2013,it is unacceptable to set exorbitant prices for student accommodation.a word of warning to university rectors in this respect: the situation will soon reach a point where the finance ministry will look at your revenues and will lower the norms accordingly.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"this is what you will end up with, and education, students and the universities will all suffer as a result.we must also make a much greater effort to export quality education services and create conditions for having foreign students and our compatriots abroad, especially from the cis countries, to study in russian universities.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"this is something that can play a very big part in strengthening russia’s cultural and intellectual influence in the world.over this coming period we must settle the matter of mutual recognition of school diplomas within the cis and also examine the matter (as a proposal) of setting up centres for sitting the russian national final school exam in accordance with russia’s standards in the cis countries, at russian language centres, for example.",PAFA
Russia,2013,these exams would be held at the same time as the national final school exam takes place in russia’s schools.,PAFA
Russia,2013,this would give talented young people from the cis greater opportunities for coming to study at russia’s universities.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"finally, we need to speed up the adoption of laws that would enable russian universities to actively develop distance learning, which would also be aimed above all at our compatriots abroad and at the cis countries.as we improve professional education, we must remember that the labour market is becoming more flexible and people need to have possibilities for re-training and getting a new professional start in life.",PAFA
Russia,2013,we must provide the right conditions for people who are willing to change jobs or move to a different town or region.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"of course, this needs to be coordinated with our regional and local development plans, and working together with business.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"we must give people information support, including by setting up a national job database, so that people everywhere can see in which region they might find a good job.",PAFA
Russia,2013,this requires a whole series of decisions.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"i ask you to draft these measures, including those on rental housing and so forth.",PAFA
Russia,2013,you know what sorts of issues i am talking about.,PAFA
Russia,2013,the list is long.,PAFA
Russia,2013,this work can and must be carried out as soon as possible.the second task is to make the countryside a more attractive place for life and work.,PAFA
Russia,2013,we have already invested considerable money in developing the agriculture sector.,PAFA
Russia,2013,the sector is showing a positive dynamic now.,PAFA
Russia,2013,in many areas we can now fully cover domestic demand with russian-produced goods.,PAFA
Russia,2013,i want to thank our rural population for their work and the results they have achieved.the big task now is to encourage people to stay in the countryside and build a modern and comfortable infrastructure in rural areas.,PAFA
Russia,2013,i ask you to pay particular attention to this issue when making changes to the state agriculture development programme.i would like to say a few words about the situation in single-industry towns.,PAFA
Russia,2013,they are part of the complicated legacy we inherited from the soviet economy.,PAFA
Russia,2013,these towns are home to more than 15 million people.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"many of them are in a difficult situation, but these towns do have an excellent base: social infrastructure, housing and a skilled labour force.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"we need to identify what is stopping business from coming here, what incentives and conditions we can offer so that investors will come to these towns not under pressure, but because they see real opportunities for themselves there.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"believe me, it is better to resolve things this way than to end up pumping tens of billions from the budget later into job creation there, which is what we will end up having to do if we do not properly address the situation now.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"i therefore ask you to draft proposals on comprehensive development in the single-industry towns, investment projects that can be carried out there, and proposed financing sources, as well as proposals on reducing labour market tension and targeted support for small and medium business.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"in this respect, i want to say to all of the regional heads that we are aware of the constraints that regional budgets face, but we do need to look beyond our immediate problems too.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"the proposal has already been made – and i support it – that all regions could offer two-year tax holidays to new small businesses working in the manufacturing, social or scientific sectors (applause).",PAFA
Russia,2013,"probably not all of the governors are applauding, but i want to say that carrying out this kind of idea today would bring dividends tomorrow in the form of additional revenue for the regions and municipalities.",PAFA
Russia,2013,these would be new businesses.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"they do not even exist at present, and so we are not talking about any loss in budget revenue here.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"on the contrary, if we create the conditions for these new businesses, we will create revenue too.",PAFA
Russia,2013,we also need to make it possible for small businesses and individual entrepreneurs to pay their taxes and insurance payments using the ‘one window’ system.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"these are different payments, but we need to make it possible for them to be paid at a single place and time.another complicated problem related to the labour market is foreign labour migration.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"the lack of proper order in this sector creates labour market distortions, causes imbalances in the social sector, provokes ethnic conflicts, and leads to higher crime rates.we need to put order in the procedures for employing foreign nationals who have visa-free entry to russia, and increase employers’ responsibility for employing foreign workers.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"of course, if these people are living and working in russia and using our country’s education and healthcare services, they must also take on their share of obligations and pay their taxes and other payments.",PAFA
Russia,2013,the task is not an easy one.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"we must preserve our special ties with the former soviet republics, but at the same time we also need to put the situation in order.",PAFA
Russia,2013,i think that in this context we should change the current license system.,PAFA
Russia,2013,foreign workers currently need to acquire a license if they are employed by a private individual.,PAFA
Russia,2013,i propose that legal entities and individual entrepreneurs should also have the possibility of hiring foreign workers on a license basis.,PAFA
Russia,2013,the license’s cost would be set by the particular region depending on the situation on the region’s labour market and the average income there.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"the license system should be differentiated and encourage above all professionals, educated specialists, who speak russian and have an affinity for our culture to come to work in russia.",PAFA
Russia,2013,i stress too that licenses would be valid only in the region where they were issued.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"i hope that if we organise this work competently, it will be an economic instrument that can help us regulate the migration flow.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"i call it an economic instrument because of the differing cost the licenses would have from one region to another in russia.finally, we need to establish tighter scrutiny of the purpose foreign nationals declare when entering russia.",PAFA
Russia,2013,all civilised countries do this.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"russia must be able to know why people are coming, and how long they plan to stay.",PAFA
Russia,2013,we also need to settle the issue of foreigners who enter russia under visa-free travel arrangements and without any specific purpose.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"at least they supposedly have no specific purpose, though in actual fact they probably do have a purpose, but the authorities know nothing about it.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"their time in the country should be limited, and entry into russia should be prohibited for people who have broken the immigration rules.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"depending on the seriousness of the violation, entry should be prohibited to enter the country for 3–10 years.these measures would set an additional barrier for foreign citizens who are working in the shadow economy or are even engaged in criminal activity, or who are working illegally, often in inhuman conditions, and who, sadly, themselves become the victims of criminals.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"colleagues,two years ago, together with the business community, we began systematic work to improve russia’s investment climate.",PAFA
Russia,2013,i can say that we have already achieved some good results.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"perhaps not many people believed that we would actually achieve these results, but they are there.",PAFA
Russia,2013,now we must go further.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"by 2015, we must have completed the main work to put in place the laws and regulatory base that will make it attractive and easy to do business in russia.for this reason, starting next year, we will publish a national rating of the investment climate situation in the different regions.",PAFA
Russia,2013,this will essentially be an instrument for evaluating the national business initiative’s implementation in each of the country’s regions.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"at the same time, we need to create incentives for regions that are developing their economic base and that have made it their mission to support business initiative and create new production facilities and jobs.let me announce a piece of good news for the regional governors.",PAFA
Russia,2013,regions that invest in developing industrial and technology parks and business incubators will have the federal taxes paid by their resident companies returned for three years to the regional budgets in the form of inter-budgetary transfers.,PAFA
Russia,2013,let me stress that this will be within the limits of the region’s expenses for building the infrastructure for these sites.there is nothing to laugh about here!,PAFA
Russia,2013,this is a good proposal.,PAFA
Russia,2013,it was the result of long and exhausting discussions with the finance ministry.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"i ask the finance minister not to water down these agreements, but to give them your full attention and carry them out.one issue that is still a sensitive matter for businesspeople is excess attention from various inspectors.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"inspections and checks are necessary, but the work to change the principles on which the oversight and inspection agencies carry out their work must continue.this work is still ongoing and it must continue.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"to make this area more transparent, i propose that we set up a unified federal portal, where every check and inspection will be given an individual number and it will be clear immediately who initiated each investigation, who was inspected, on what grounds the inspectors carried out their investigations, and, most important, what results the investigations produced.let me note another problem too, namely, that our mechanisms for settling economic disputes are still a long way behind the best global practices.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"in this context, we also need to make a serious effort to raise the arbitration courts’ authority.i ask the government, together with the russian union of industrialists and entrepreneurs and the chamber of commerce and industry, to draw up a draft law on fundamental improvements to the arbitration system and submit it to the state duma as soon as possible.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"in last year’s address, i spoke about the challenges in relieving the economy of offshore activity.",PAFA
Russia,2013,this is another topic to which i want to draw your attention and which we must return to today.why is that?,PAFA
Russia,2013,"i will tell you frankly that so far, the results are barely perceptible.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"let me remind you about a major transaction that took place this year, worth over $50 billion.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"the sale of tnk-bp shares occurred outside of russia’s jurisdiction, although we all know that the sellers were russian nationals, and the buyer was one of russia’s largest companies.last year, according to expert assessments, $111 billion worth of russian goods passed through offshores and partial offshores – that’s 20% of our exports.",PAFA
Russia,2013,half of the $50 billion of russian investments abroad also went to offshores.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"these figures represent the withdrawal of capital that should be working in russia and direct losses to the nation’s budget.since nothing significant has been achieved in this area this year, i want to make the following suggestions.the incomes of companies that are registered in offshore jurisdictions and belong to russian owners or whose ultimate beneficiaries are russian nationals must follow russian tax laws, and tax payments must be made to the russian budget.",PAFA
Russia,2013,we must think through a system for how to collect that money.such methods exist and there is nothing unusual here.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"some countries have already implemented such a system: if you want to use offshores, go ahead, but the money has to come here.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"it is being implemented in countries with developed market economies, and this approach is working.moreover, companies that are registered in a foreign jurisdiction will not be allowed to make use of government support measures, including vnesheconombank credits and state guarantees.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"these companies should also lose the right to fulfil government contracts and contracts for agencies with government participation.in other words, if you want to take advantage of the benefits and support provided by the state and make a profit working in russia, you must register in the russian federation’s jurisdiction.we must increase the transparency of our economy.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"it is imperative to introduce criminal liability for executives who knowingly provide false or incomplete information about the true state of banks, insurance companies, pension funds and other financial institutions.we need to maintain our fundamental, firm position on ridding our credit and financial system of various types of money laundering operations.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"meanwhile, the interests of honest clients and depositors in problematic banks should be securely protected.today, the fight against the erosion of the tax base and the use of various offshore schemes is a global trend.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"these issues are widely discussed at the g8 and g20 summits, and russia will conduct this policy at both an international and national level.the need for liability fully applies not only to private businesses, but executives at state-controlled companies and development institutions as well.",PAFA
Russia,2013,i propose that the government should radically change the principles of its work; there should not be any executive comfort zones here.,PAFA
Russia,2013,they are paid very good money.,PAFA
Russia,2013,we will not achieve much economic progress if we undermine them; we will not be able to employ the professionals we need.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"but we must establish supervision over their work, and we must do it the right way.all such organisations must develop their own long-term strategies, which should state clear goals and personal responsibility indicators for their leadership.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"executives’ employment agreements must stipulate liability for failure to fulfil the set objectives, including financial liability.company programmes for corporations included in the strategic enterprise list must be approved by the government of the russian federation, and their implementation should undergo an external audit.",PAFA
Russia,2013,i looked at the list yesterday: there are several dozen such companies.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"we have several lists, but the list of strategic enterprises includes only several dozen.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"of course, this means an additional workload, but i am confident that the government will rise up to this challenge.i will stress again that government and private sector resources should go toward development and achieving strategic objectives.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"for example, let’s look at such objectives as developing siberia and the far east.",PAFA
Russia,2013,this is our national priority for the entire 21st century.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"the challenges we will need to tackle are unprecedented in their scale, which means we must take unconventional approaches.we have already made a decision on a reduced income tax rate and a number of other taxes for new investment projects in the far east.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"i feel it would be expedient to expand this regime to all of eastern siberia, including krasnoyarsk territory and the republic of khakassia.moreover, i suggest creating a network of special advanced economic development zones in the far east and eastern siberia with special conditions for organising non-extractive production, including that intended for export.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"new companies located in such zones, in such territories, should be provided with five-year exemptions for income tax, mineral extraction tax (with the exception of oil and gas, which is a profitable sector), land and property taxes, as well as preferential insurance rates, which are very important for high-tech manufacturing.what’s also important is to create conditions here that will be competitive with key business centres of the asia-pacific region.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"such conditions should apply to authorisation procedures for construction, connecting to electricity networks, and passing through customs.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"we will make active use of the far east development fund in order to resolve infrastructure issues in these territories.we will need to decide on the exact location of these territories by july 1, 2014, and adopt all the legal regulatory acts necessary for them to operate.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"given the importance and scale of this endeavour, i am asking the prime minister to personally supervise this work.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"in the future, we will make decisions about their future development based on the experience and practice of working in such zones and the resulting effect.we will also continue the projects already being implemented at this time.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"as you know, a new university has been established on russky island.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"it will conduct a sound scientific evaluation with regard to far east development programmes, and provide for the region’s employment needs, first and foremost in areas such as space, biotechnology, robotic technologies, design, engineering, oceanography and the use of marine resources.i am confident that russia’s reorientation toward the pacific ocean and the dynamic development in all our eastern territories will not only open up new economic opportunities and new horizons, but also provide additional instruments for an active foreign policy.colleagues, global development is becoming increasingly contradictory and dynamic.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"russia’s historical responsibility is growing in these conditions, not only because it is one of the key guarantors of global and regional stability, but also a nation that consistently asserts its value-based approaches, including in international relations.the intensity of military, political, economic, and informational competition throughout the world is not decreasing, but only getting stronger.",PAFA
Russia,2013,other power centres are closely monitoring russia’s progress as it grows stronger.we have always been proud of our nation.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"but we do not claim to be any sort of superpower with a claim to global or regional hegemony; we do not encroach on anyone’s interests, impose our patronage onto anyone, or try to teach others how to live their lives.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"but we will strive to be leaders, defending international law, striving for respect and national sovereignty and peoples’ independence and identity.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"this is absolutely objective and understandable for a state like russia, with its great history and culture, with many centuries of experience, not so-called tolerance, neutered and barren, but the actual common, natural life of different peoples within the framework of a single state.today, many nations are revising their moral values and ethical norms, eroding ethnic traditions and differences between peoples and cultures.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"society is now required not only to recognise everyone’s right to the freedom of consciousness, political views and privacy, but also to accept without question the equality of good and evil, strange as it seems, concepts that are opposite in meaning.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"this destruction of traditional values from above not only leads to negative consequences for society, but is also essentially anti-democratic, since it is carried out on the basis of abstract, speculative ideas, contrary to the will of the majority, which does not accept the changes occurring or the proposed revision of values.we know that there are more and more people in the world who support our position on defending traditional values that have made up the spiritual and moral foundation of civilisation in every nation for thousands of years: the values of traditional families, real human life, including religious life, not just material existence but also spirituality, the values of humanism and global diversity.of course, this is a conservative position.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"but speaking in the words of nikolai berdyaev, the point of conservatism is not that it prevents movement forward and upward, but that it prevents movement backward and downward, into chaotic darkness and a return to a primitive state.in recent years, we have seen how attempts to push supposedly more progressive development models onto other nations actually resulted in regression, barbarity and extensive bloodshed.",PAFA
Russia,2013,this happened in many middle eastern and north african countries.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"this dramatic situation unfolded in syria.as far as syria is concerned, the international community had to jointly make a momentous choice: to either descend into further erosion of the world order’s foundations, or collectively make responsible decisions.i feel it was our common success when the choice was made on the basis of the fundamental principles of international law, common sense and the logic of peace.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"so far, at least, we have been able to avoid external military intervention in syria’s affairs and the spread of the conflict far beyond the region.russia made significant contributions to this process.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"we acted firmly, thoughtfully and carefully.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"we never jeopardised our own interests and security, nor global stability.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"in my view, that is how a mature and responsible nation must act.as a result, together with our partners, we managed to steer the course of events away from war and toward establishing a nationwide political process and civil consensus in syria.",PAFA
Russia,2013,syria’s chemical weapons arsenal is now under international control.,PAFA
Russia,2013,its liquidation is an important step in strengthening non-proliferation regimes for weapons of mass destruction.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"the syrian precedent confirmed the un’s central role in global politics.the syrian crisis, and now the situation in iran as well, clearly demonstrate that any international problem can and should be resolved exclusively through political means, without resorting to forceful actions with little potential that are rejected by most nations in the world.this year, we saw a breakthrough with the iranian nuclear programme, but it was only the first step.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"it is imperative to continue patiently searching for a broader solution that will guarantee iran’s inalienable right to develop peaceful nuclear energy and – i want to stress this – security for all countries in the region, including israel.incidentally, it was iran’s nuclear programme that once served as the main argument in favour of deploying a missile defence system.",PAFA
Russia,2013,so what is happening now?,PAFA
Russia,2013,"the iranian nuclear issue is being resolved, but the missile defence system remains.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"and it doesn’t just remain, it is being developed further.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"but i will talk about that a little later.i want to stress again: russia is prepared for joint efforts with all partners in the interest of ensuring common, equal, indivisible security.russia’s g8 presidency in 2014 will focus on acute global problems: strengthening non-proliferation regimes, combating international terrorism and drug trafficking.",PAFA
Russia,2013,we will also act in accordance with these principles when preparing to host the brics and shanghai cooperation organisation (sco) summits in 2015.,PAFA
Russia,2013,we are now entering a crucial stage in preparing the eurasian economic union treaty.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"we expect to have agreed on the treaty’s text by may 1, 2014 and to have submitted it to the russian, belarusian and kazakhstani parliaments by that time.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"colleagues, i would ask you to prioritise this document and give it your consideration and support.let me add that working groups are currently preparing roadmaps governing the accession of kyrgyzstan and armenia to the customs union.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"i am sure that the real achievements of eurasian integration will only enhance our other neighbours’ interest in it, including that of our ukrainian partners.even before all these protests that we are now witnessing in kiev – and i very much hope that the country’s political forces will be able to negotiate and resolve ukraine’s accumulated problems in the interests of its citizens – before all these problems began, starting in may ukraine has expressed its desire to be present at all meetings between russia, belarus and kazakhstan as an observer.",PAFA
Russia,2013,ukraine participates in discussions and has repeatedly declared its interest in joining some of the customs union’s agreements.we are not imposing anything on anybody.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"but if our friends want to work together, then we are ready to continue this work at the expert level.our integration project is based on equal rights and on real economic interests.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"we will consistently promote the eurasian process, without setting it against other integration projects including the more mature european one.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"we proceed from our complementarity and naturally we will continue to work with our european friends on a new basic agreement.colleagues,a few words about our actions to further strengthen our armed forces.i just mentioned the issue of missile defence, and here’s what i would like to say in this regard.",PAFA
Russia,2013,we are all perfectly aware that the missile defence system is defensive in name only.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"in fact, it is a crucial component of strategic offensive capabilities.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"the development of new weapons systems, such as low-yield nuclear weapons, strategic non-nuclear missiles and hypersonic high-precision non-nuclear systems for prompt, long-range strikes are also causes for concern.we are closely following the development of the so-called prompt global strike system, which is being actively developed by some countries.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"implementing all of these plans could have extremely negative consequences for regional and global stability.the ramping up of high-precision strategic non-nuclear systems by other countries, in combination with the build-up of missile defence capabilities, could negate all previous agreements on the limitation and reduction of strategic nuclear weapons, and disrupt the strategic balance of power.we understand this very well, and in this context we know exactly what we need to do.",PAFA
Russia,2013,no one should entertain any illusions about achieving military superiority over russia; we will never allow it.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"russia will respond to all these challenges, both political and technological.",PAFA
Russia,2013,we have all we need in order to do so.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"our military doctrine and advanced weapons, weapons that are being and will be deployed, will unconditionally allow us to ensure the security of the russian state.we still have a lot to do to develop modern high-precision weapons systems.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"at the same time, judged by qualitative parameters for modern strategic nuclear deterrent forces, today we are successfully reaching new milestones on schedule, and some of our partners will have to catch up.we are developing new strategic missile systems for land, sea and air to further strengthen our nuclear forces.",PAFA
Russia,2013,we will continue to strengthen our strategic missile forces and continue building a fleet of nuclear submarines.,PAFA
Russia,2013,we are also starting work on a promising long-range aviation system.the establishment of a global intelligence network is the next step on our agenda.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"the formation of an integrated, real-time global network for reconnaissance and targeting, which will operate in a single informational space in the interests of the armed forces of the russian federation, is extremely important.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"this is connected with additions to our satellite group.we will continue to develop our general purpose forces: aviation, the navy and the land forces.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"this year in keeping with our plans, the number of privates and sergeants under contract increased to 220,000.",PAFA
Russia,2013,at the same time we have to think how to create highly trained reserve forces.there is another suggestion in this regard: keeping deferrals for students and changing the very system of military training offered by institutions of higher education.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"this will enable all students to study, receive military training for their next military assignment and a particular area of military specialisation.this mechanism will allow us to train the right amount of reservists for the most needed, primarily technical military specialisations, while not drafting them into the armed forces.",PAFA
Russia,2013,i would ask the government and the security council to submit concrete proposals for how such a system could be organised.next.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"as you know, the funds we are allocating for rearming the army and the navy, for modernising the defence industry are unprecedented.",PAFA
Russia,2013,they total 23 trillion rubles [more than $700 billion].,PAFA
Russia,2013,"in the next decade, our defence companies will be fully loaded with orders.",PAFA
Russia,2013,they will be able to upgrade their manufacturing base and create high-quality jobs.,PAFA
Russia,2013,let me recall that in russia about two million people work in the defence industry.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"together with their families, the number comes to almost seven million people.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"and specialists in this sector will have stable, well-paid jobs, and their families will be provided for.now we have to think about what the defence industry’s companies will do after having fulfilled the state defence procurement order, after 2020.",PAFA
Russia,2013,we cannot allow them to become obsolete.we need to strengthen our position in global markets.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"i would ask the military-industrial commission to submit proposals in this regard, to ensure that our businesses can promptly switch to releasing in-demand civilian products onto both our domestic market and foreign ones.there’s another point i would like to emphasise.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"we said that all defence ministry servicemen who began their service before january 1, 2012 would receive permanent housing by the end of this year.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"this task should be fully completed in the near future, and it will be.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"i would draw the defence ministry’s attention to this and ask you to deal with the issue on a case-by-case basis, helping people choose the best option for them.colleagues,for the first time in our country’s history, we are turning the page on the issue of permanent housing for servicemen in russia’s army and navy.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"now we can concentrate on completing the construction of modern service housing and comfortable military bases.colleagues,a sense of responsibility for the country is the main theme, lifeblood, and core value of the russian constitution, and it is also a call to each of us.the nation’s strategic development agenda is well-known; this address has outlined main areas of work and ways to achieve specific goals.everything that has been stated here must be executed without any reservations, new suggestions or bureaucratic interpretations.",PAFA
Russia,2013,this is what the authorities’ most important and most notable task consists in.it is our duty to increase people’s trust.,PAFA
Russia,2013,"only in this way will we be able to increase the activity of our citizens, and people will want to contribute to our country’s development.let me repeat that if a decision has been made, then it must be implemented.",PAFA
Russia,2013,"i consider this approach to be a concise expression of shared responsibility, and would suggest making this the motto of the coming year, a motto for everyone: for the government, for society, for citizens.i am absolutely convinced that by drawing on the best traditions of our people, by using the latest ideas and most effective development paths, we will meet all the challenges we face and guarantee our success.thank you for your attention.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"citizens of russia, members of the federation council and deputies of the state duma,today’s address will be related to the current situation and conditions, as well as the tasks we are facing.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"but before delivering it i’d like to thank all of you for the support, unity and solidarity you have shown during the landmark events that will seriously influence the future of our country.this year we faced trials that only a mature and united nation and a truly sovereign and strong state can withstand.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"russia has proved that it can protect its compatriots and defend truth and fairness.russia has done this thanks to its citizens, thanks to your work and the results we have achieved together, and thanks to our profound understanding of the essence and importance of national interests.",PAFA
Russia,2014,we have become aware of the indivisibility and integrity of the thousand-year long history of our country.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"we have come to believe in ourselves, to believe that we can do much and achieve every goal.of course, we will talk about this year’s landmark events.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"you know that a referendum was held in crimea in march, at which its residents clearly expressed their desire to join russia.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"after that, the crimean parliament – it should be stressed that it was a legitimate parliament that was elected back in 2010 – adopted a resolution on sovereignty.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"and then we saw the historical reunification of crimea and sevastopol with russia.it was an event of special significance for the country and the people, because crimea is where our people live, and the peninsula is of strategic importance for russia as the spiritual source of the development of a multifaceted but solid russian nation and a centralised russian state.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"it was in crimea, in the ancient city of chersonesus or korsun, as ancient russian chroniclers called it, that grand prince vladimir was baptised before bringing christianity to rus.in addition to ethnic similarity, a common language, common elements of their material culture, a common territory, even though its borders were not marked then, and a nascent common economy and government, christianity was a powerful spiritual unifying force that helped involve various tribes and tribal unions of the vast eastern slavic world in the creation of a russian nation and russian state.",PAFA
Russia,2014,it was thanks to this spiritual unity that our forefathers for the first time and forevermore saw themselves as a united nation.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"all of this allows us to say that crimea, the ancient korsun or chersonesus, and sevastopol have invaluable civilisational and even sacral importance for russia, like the temple mount in jerusalem for the followers of islam and judaism.and this is how we will always consider it.dear friends,we cannot fail to mention today our perspective on the developments in ukraine and how we intend to work with our partners around the world.it is well known that russia not only supported ukraine and other brotherly republics of the former soviet union in their aspirations to sovereignty, but also facilitated this process greatly in the 1990s.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"since then, our position has remained unchanged.every nation has an inalienable sovereign right to determine its own development path, choose allies and political regimes, create an economy and ensure its security.",PAFA
Russia,2014,russia has always respected these rights and always will.,PAFA
Russia,2014,this fully applies to ukraine and the ukrainian people.it is true that we condemned the government coup and the forceful takeover of power in kiev in february of this year.,PAFA
Russia,2014,the developments we are currently witnessing in ukraine and the tragedy unfolding in the country’s southeast prove that we were right to take such a stand.how did it all begin?,PAFA
Russia,2014,i will have to remind you what happened back then.,PAFA
Russia,2014,it is hard to believe that it all started with a technical decision by president yanukovych to postpone the signing of the association agreement between ukraine and the european union.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"make no mistake, he did not refuse to sign the document, but only postponed it in order to make some adjustments.as you recall, this move was fully in line with the constitutional authority vested upon an absolutely legitimate and internationally recognised head of state.against this background, there was no way we could support this armed coup, the violence and the killings.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"just take the bloody events in odessa, where people were burned alive.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"how can the subsequent attempts to suppress people in ukraine’s southeast, who oppose this mayhem, be supported?",PAFA
Russia,2014,i reiterate that there was no way we could endorse these developments.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"what’s more, they were followed by hypocritical statements on the protection of international law and human rights.",PAFA
Russia,2014,this is just cynical.,PAFA
Russia,2014,i strongly believe that the time will come when the ukrainian people will deliver a just assessment of these developments.how did the dialogue on this issue begin between russia and its american and european partners?,PAFA
Russia,2014,"i mentioned our american friends for a reason, since they are always influencing russia’s relations with its neighbours, either openly or behind the scenes.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"sometimes it is even unclear whom to talk to: to the governments of certain countries or directly with their american patrons and sponsors.as i mentioned, in the case of the ukraine-eu association agreement, there was no dialogue at all.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"we were told that it was none of our business or, to put it simply, we were told where to go.all the arguments that russia and ukraine are members of the cis free-trade zone, that we have deep-rooted cooperation in industry and agriculture, and basically share the same infrastructure – no one wanted to hear these arguments, let alone take them into account.our response was to say: fine, if you do not want to have a dialogue with us, we will have to protect our legitimate interests unilaterally and will not pay for what we view as erroneous policy.so what’s came out of it all?",PAFA
Russia,2014,"the agreement between ukraine and the european union has been signed and ratified, but the implementation of the provisions regarding trade and economy has been postponed until the end of next year.",PAFA
Russia,2014,doesn’t this mean that we were the ones who were actually right?,PAFA
Russia,2014,there is also a question of why all this was done in ukraine?,PAFA
Russia,2014,what was the purpose of the government coup?,PAFA
Russia,2014,why shoot and keep shooting and killing people?,PAFA
Russia,2014,"in fact, the economy, finance and the social sector were destroyed and the country ruined.what ukraine currently needs is economic assistance in carrying out reforms, not petty politics and pompous empty promises.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"however, our western colleagues don’t seem eager to provide such assistance, while the kiev authorities are not willing to address the challenges their people are facing.by the way, russia has already made a major contribution to helping ukraine.",PAFA
Russia,2014,let me reiterate that russian banks already invested some $25 billion in ukraine.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"last year, russia’s finance ministry extended a loan worth another $3 billion.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"gazprom provided another $5.5 billion to ukraine and even offered a discount that no one promised, requiring the country to pay $4.5 billion.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"add it all up and you get as much as $ 32.5–33.5 billion that were provided only recently.of course, we have the right to ask questions.",PAFA
Russia,2014,what was this ukrainian tragedy for?,PAFA
Russia,2014,"wasn’t it possible to settle all the issues, even disputed issues, through dialogue, within a legal framework and legitimately?",PAFA
Russia,2014,"but now we are being told that this was actually competent, balanced politics that we should comply with unquestionably and blindfolded.this will never happen.if for some european countries national pride is a long-forgotten concept and sovereignty is too much of a luxury, true sovereignty for russia is absolutely necessary for survival.primarily, we should realise this as a nation.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"i would like to emphasise this: either we remain a sovereign nation, or we dissolve without a trace and lose our identity.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"of course, other countries need to understand this, too.",PAFA
Russia,2014,all participants in international life should be aware of this.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"and they should use this understanding to strengthen the role and the importance of international law, which we’ve talked about so much lately, rather than bend its standards to suit someone's strategic interests contrary to its fundamental principles and common sense, considering everyone else to be poorly educated people who can’t read or write.it is imperative to respect the legitimate interests of all the participants in international dialogue.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"only then, not with guns, missiles or combat aircraft, but precisely with the rule of law will we reliably protect the world against bloody conflict.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"only then, will there be no need to scare anyone with imaginary self-deceptive isolation, or sanctions, which are, of course, damaging, but damaging to everyone, including those who initiate them.speaking of the sanctions, they are not just a knee-jerk reaction on behalf of the united states or its allies to our position regarding the events and the coup in ukraine, or even the so-called crimean spring.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"i’m sure that if these events had never happened – i want to point this out specifically for you as politicians sitting in this auditorium – if none of that had ever happened, they would have come up with some other excuse to try to contain russia’s growing capabilities, affect our country in some way, or even take advantage of it.the policy of containment was not invented yesterday.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"it has been carried out against our country for many years, always, for decades, if not centuries.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"in short, whenever someone thinks that russia has become too strong or independent, these tools are quickly put into use.however, talking to russia from a position of force is an exercise in futility, even when it was faced with domestic hardships, as in the 1990s and early 2000s.we remember well how and who, almost openly, supported separatism back then and even outright terrorism in russia, referred to murderers, whose hands were stained with blood, none other than rebels and organised high-level receptions for them.",PAFA
Russia,2014,these “rebels” showed up in chechnya again.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"i'm sure the local guys, the local law enforcement authorities, will take proper care of them.",PAFA
Russia,2014,they are now working to eliminate another terrorist raid.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"let’s support them.let me reiterate, we remember high-level receptions for terrorists dubbed as fighters for freedom and democracy.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"back then, we realised that the more ground we give and the more excuses we make, the more our opponents become brazen and the more cynical and aggressive their demeanour becomes.despite our unprecedented openness back then and our willingness to cooperate in all, even the most sensitive issues, despite the fact that we considered – and all of you are aware of this and remember it – our former adversaries as close friends and even allies, the support for separatism in russia from across the pond, including information, political and financial support and support provided by the special services – was absolutely obvious and left no doubt that they would gladly let russia follow the yugoslav scenario of disintegration and dismemberment.",PAFA
Russia,2014,with all the tragic fallout for the people of russia.it didn’t work.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"we didn’t allow that to happen.just as it did not work for hitler with his people-hating ideas, who set out to destroy russia and push us back beyond the urals.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"everyone should remember how it ended.next year, we will mark the 70th anniversary of victory in the great patriotic war.",PAFA
Russia,2014,our army crushed the enemy and liberated europe.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"however, we should not forget about the bitter defeats in 1941 and 1942 so as not to repeat the mistakes in the future.in this context, i will touch on an international security issue.",PAFA
Russia,2014,there are many issues related to this.,PAFA
Russia,2014,these include the fight against terrorism.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"we still encounter its manifestations, and of course, we will participate in the joint efforts to counter terrorism on the international level.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"of course, we will work together to deal with other challenges, such as the spread of infectious diseases.however, in this case i would like to speak about the most serious and sensitive issue: international security.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"since 2002, after the us unilaterally pulled out of the abm treaty, which was absolutely a cornerstone of international security, a strategic balance of forces and stability, the us has been working relentlessly to create a global missile defence system, including in europe.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"this poses a threat not only to russia, but to the world as a whole – precisely due to the possible disruption of this strategic balance of forces.i believe that this is bad for the us as well, because it creates the dangerous illusion of invulnerability.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"it strengthens the striving for unilateral, often, as we can see, ill-considered decisions and additional risks.we have said much about this.",PAFA
Russia,2014,i will not go into details now.,PAFA
Russia,2014,i will only say this.,PAFA
Russia,2014,maybe i am repeating myself.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"we have no intention to become involved in a costly arms race, but at the same time we will reliably and dependably guarantee our country’s defence in the new conditions.",PAFA
Russia,2014,there are absolutely no doubts about this.,PAFA
Russia,2014,this will be done.,PAFA
Russia,2014,russia has both the capability and the innovative solutions for this.no one will ever attain military superiority over russia.,PAFA
Russia,2014,we have a modern and combat ready army.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"as they now put it, a polite, but formidable army.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"we have the strength, will and courage to protect our freedom.we will protect the diversity of the world.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"we will tell the truth to people abroad, so that everyone can see the real and not distorted and false image of russia.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"we will actively promote business and humanitarian relations, as well as scientific, education and cultural relations.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"we will do this even if some governments attempt to create a new iron curtain around russia.we will never enter the path of self-isolation, xenophobia, suspicion and the search for enemies.all this is evidence of weakness, while we are strong and confident.our goal is to have as many equal partners as possible, both in the west and in the east.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"we will expand our presence in those regions where integration is on the rise, where politics is not mixed with economy, and where obstacles to trade, to exchange of technology and investment and to the free movement of people are lifted.under no conditions will we curtail our relations with europe or america.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"at the same time, we will restore and expand our traditional ties with south america.",PAFA
Russia,2014,we will continue our cooperation with africa and the middle east.we see how quickly asia pacific has been developing over the past few decades.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"as a pacific power, russia will use this huge potential comprehensively.everyone knows the leaders and the drivers of global economic development.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"many of them are our sincere friends and strategic partners.the eurasian economic union will start working in full on january 1, 2015.",PAFA
Russia,2014,i’d like to remind you about its fundamental principles.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"the topmost principles are equality, pragmatism and mutual respect, as well as the preservation of national identity and state sovereignty of its member countries.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"i am confident that strong cooperation will become a powerful source of development for all of the eurasian economic union members.to conclude this part of my address, i’d like to say once again that our priorities are healthy families and a healthy nation, the traditional values which we inherited from our forefathers, combined with a focus on the future, stability as a vital condition of development and progress, respect for other nations and states, and the guaranteed security of russia and the protection of its legitimate interests.dear friends,to be able to implement all our plans and to meet the basic social commitments set forth in the presidential executive orders of may 2012, we must decide what we will do in the economy, finance and social spheres.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"but most importantly, we must choose a strategy.i repeat that russia will be open to the world, cooperation, foreign investment and joint projects.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"but we must above all see that our development depends primarily on us.we will only succeed if we work towards prosperity and affluence, rather than hope for an opening or a favourable situation on foreign markets.we will succeed if we defeat disorder, irresponsibility and our habit of burying good decisions in red tape.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"i want everyone to understand that in today’s world this is not simply an obstacle to russia’s development but a direct threat to its security.the period ahead will be complex and difficult, when much will depend on what each one of us do at our workplaces.",PAFA
Russia,2014,the so-called sanctions and foreign restrictions are an incentive for a more efficient and faster movement towards our goals.there is much we need to do.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"we need to create new technologies, a competitive environment and an additional margin of strength in the industries, the financial system and in the training of personnel.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"we have a large domestic market and natural resources, capital and research projects for this.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"we also have talented, intelligent and diligent people who can learn very quickly.the most important thing now is to give the people an opportunity for self-fulfilment.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"freedom for development in the economic and social spheres, for public initiatives is the best possible response both to any external restrictions and to our domestic problems.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"the more actively people become involved in organising their own lives, the more independent they are, both economically and politically, and the greater russia’s potential.in this context, i will cite one quote: “he who loves russia should wish freedom for it; above all, freedom for russia as such, for its international independence and self-sufficiency; freedom for russia as a unity of russian and all other ethnic cultures; and finally, freedom for the russian people, freedom for all of us: freedom of faith, of the search for truth, creativity, work, and property.”",PAFA
Russia,2014,ivan ilyin.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"this makes a lot of sense and offers a good guideline for all of us today.ladies and gentlemen,conscientious work, private property, the freedom of enterprise – these are the same kind of fundamental conservative values as patriotism, and respect for the history, traditions, and culture of one’s country.we all want the same thing: wellbeing for russia.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"so the relations between business and the state should be built on the philosophy of a common cause, partnership, and equal dialogue.naturally, responsibility and compliance with the law and obligations are essential in the business world, as it is in other areas of life.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"and this is exactly how the overwhelming, absolute majority of our business people work.",PAFA
Russia,2014,they value their business and social reputation.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"like genuine patriots, they want to be a benefit to russia.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"these are the kind of people to look to, providing conditions for their productive work.this is not the first time we are speaking about the need for new approaches to the activities of oversight, supervisory, and law enforcement agencies.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"nevertheless, things are changing very slowly here.",PAFA
Russia,2014,the presumption of guilt is still very much alive.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"instead of curbing individual violations, they close the path and create problems for thousands of law-abiding, self-motivated people.it is essential to lift restrictions on business as much as possible, free it from intrusive supervision and control.",PAFA
Russia,2014,i said intrusive supervision and control.,PAFA
Russia,2014,i will consider this in more detail later.,PAFA
Russia,2014,i propose the following measures in this regard.every inspection should become public.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"next year, a special register will be launched, with information on what agency has initiated an inspection, for what purpose, and what results it has produced.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"this will make it possible to stop unwarranted and, worse still, ‘paid to order’ visits from oversight agencies.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"this problem is extremely relevant not only for business, but also for the public sector, municipal institutions and social ngos.finally, it’s crucial to abandon the basic principle of total, endless control.",PAFA
Russia,2014,the situation should be monitored where there are real risks or signs of transgression.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"you see, even when we have already done something with regard to restrictions, and these restrictions seem to be working well, there are so many inspection agencies that if every one of them comes at least once, then that’s it, the company would just fold.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"in 2015, the government should make all the necessary decisions to switch to this system, a system of restrictions with regard to reviews and inspections.concerning small business, i propose establishing ‘holidays from inspections’.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"if a company has acquired a good reputation and if there have not been any serious charges against it for three years, then for the next three years it should be exempted from routine inspections by government or municipal supervisory agencies.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"of course, this does not apply to emergencies, when there is a danger to people’s health and life.business people talk about the need for stable legislation and predictable rules, including taxes.",PAFA
Russia,2014,i completely agree with this.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"i propose to freeze the existing tax parameters as they are for the next four years, not revisit the matter again, not change them.meanwhile, it is important to implement the decisions that have already been made to ease the tax burden.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"first of all, for those who are just setting up their operations.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"as we have agreed, two-year tax holidays will be provided to small businesses registering for the first time.",PAFA
Russia,2014,production facilities that are starting from scratch will be entitled to the same exemptions.another thing.,PAFA
Russia,2014,i propose a full amnesty for capital returning to russia.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"i stress, full amnesty.of course, it is essential to explain to the people who will make these decisions what full amnesty means.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"it means that if a person legalises his holdings and property in russia, he will receive firm legal guarantees that he will not be summoned to various agencies, including law enforcement agencies, that they will not “put the squeeze” on him, that he will not be asked about the sources of his capital and methods of its acquisition, that he will not be prosecuted or face administrative liability, and that he will not be questioned by the tax service or law enforcement agencies.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"let’s do this now, but only once.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"everyone who wants to come to russia should be given this opportunity.we all understand that the sources of assets are different, that they were earned or acquired in various ways.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"however, i am confident that we should finally close, turn the “offshore page” in the history of our economy and our country.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"it is very important and necessary to do this.i expect that after the well-known events in cyprus and with the on-going sanctions campaign, our business has finally realised that its interests abroad are not reckoned with and that it can even be fleeced like a sheep.and that the best possible guarantee is national jurisdiction, even with all of its problems.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"we will continue to deal with those problems with conviction, together with our business community, of course.russia has already made significant headway in improving its business climate.",PAFA
Russia,2014,a new legislative framework has for the most part been developed on the federal level.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"now the focus should be shifted to the quality of law enforcement, promoting so called best practices in the regions in partnership with business, using the national investment climate ratings to this end.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"from next year, the ratings system will be introduced in all the regions.",PAFA
Russia,2014,we will review the progress at a state council meeting without fail.we need properly developed construction sites and transport infrastructure in order to be able to expand businesses and accommodate new production sites.,PAFA
Russia,2014,our regions must focus on fixing regional and local roads.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"to enable them to do so, we have introduced additional sources for regional road funds.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"overall, we should seek to double the volume of road construction across russia.of course, what i have just said has been verified by the relevant government agencies.",PAFA
Russia,2014,they all confirmed that this is a feasible project.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"we’ll be expecting to see the results of your work, colleagues.in 2015, we will launch a programme to reimburse the regions’ expenses involved in creating technology parks.",PAFA
Russia,2014,i hope that the regions will make good use of this opportunity to develop their own industrial capacity.,PAFA
Russia,2014,these additional measures are being taken in order to support economic and industrial growth in strategically important russian regions.the law on a special economic zone in crimea has been adopted.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"favourable conditions will be created here for businesses, agriculture and tourism, manufacturing industries and maritime transport, including taxation, customs and other procedures.as you may be aware, customs preferences for kaliningrad region will expire in 2016.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"it is imperative that alternative measures to support this region, which have already been prepared, be implemented in order to maintain a comfortable entrepreneurial climate.i’d like to ask the government to complete this work as soon as possible.",PAFA
Russia,2014,i’d also like to ask the deputies not to delay their review of the law on priority development areas (pda).,PAFA
Russia,2014,"in addition, i propose extending pda regulations to new projects in a number of single-industry cities with the most difficult socioeconomic situations, rather than waiting three years, as provided by the draft law (i believe it has passed its first reading).",PAFA
Russia,2014,"instead, we should amend it and start working on single-industry cities right away.of course, pdas should play a key role in developing the russian far east.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"we have announced ambitious plans for developing this region, and we will, of course, implement them.",PAFA
Russia,2014,i’d like to ask the government to consider recapitalising the far east development fund.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"we can allocate a portion of federal tax increments, which will be obtained from new businesses opening in the region, for these purposes.as is often the case in such matters, we had a tough conversation on this issue with the finance ministry.",PAFA
Russia,2014,we agree that initially this can be done with an exception for vat.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"then, we’ll see how well this system works.i propose providing a free port status to vladivostok, with an attractive and easy customs regime.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"as you may be aware, sevastopol and other crimean ports have already been given this status.we also need a comprehensive project for modern and competitive development of the northern sea route.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"it must operate not just as an effective transit route, but also promote business activity on the russian pacific coast and the development of arctic territories.colleagues, the quality and the size of the russian economy must be consistent with our geopolitical and historical role.",PAFA
Russia,2014,we must escape the trap of zero-level growth and achieve an above-average global growth rate within the next three to four years.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"this is the only way to increase russia’s share in the global economy, and thus strengthen our influence and economic independence.the national economy should also be more effective.",PAFA
Russia,2014,it’s imperative that labour productivity be increased by no less than five percent annually.,PAFA
Russia,2014,the government should find reserves for this and come up with a plan for the best way to use them.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"at the same time, it’s important to maintain a stable macroeconomic environment and reduce inflation in the medium term to four percent, but, importantly, not through suppressing business activity.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"we must at last learn to harmonise two goals: containing inflation and stimulating growth.today we are faced with reduced foreign exchange proceeds and, as a consequence, with a weaker national currency, the ruble.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"as you are aware, the bank of russia has switched to a floating exchange rate, but this does not mean that the bank of russia has withdrawn from controlling the exchange rate, and that the ruble may now be the object of unchecked financial speculation.i’d like to ask the bank of russia and the government to carry out tough and concerted actions to discourage the so-called speculators from playing on fluctuations of the russian currency.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"in this regard, i’d like to point out that the authorities know who these speculators are.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"we have the proper instruments of influence, and the time is ripe to use them.of course, a weaker ruble increases the risk of a short-term surge in inflation.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"it’s imperative that we protect the interests of our people, first and foremost, those with low incomes, and the government and the regions must ensure control over the situation on the food, medicine and other basic goods markets.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"i’m sure this can be done without any problem, and it must be done.a weaker national currency also increases the pricing environment and the competitiveness of our companies.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"we take this factor into account in our policy of import substitution (at least, where it’s appropriate and necessary).",PAFA
Russia,2014,"within three to five years, we must provide our customers with high-quality and affordable medicines and food that are produced mostly in russia.the grain crop in russia in 2014 was one of the best in recent history.",PAFA
Russia,2014,the overall output growth across our agro-industrial complex currently stands at about 6 percent.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"we now have efficient large agricultural enterprises and farms, and we will support them.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"let’s thank our agricultural workers for their performance this year.we must also lessen our critical dependence on foreign technology and industrial goods, including in the machine-tool building and instrument-making industries, power engineering, and the production of equipment for field development, including on the arctic shelf.",PAFA
Russia,2014,our commodities and infrastructure companies can seriously help our producers in this sphere.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"when implementing large oil, energy and transport projects, they must rely above all on domestic producers and promote demand for their products.at this point, it’s mostly the other way around: we buy everything abroad, leaving the domestic industries and science empty-handed.",PAFA
Russia,2014,i suggest creating a special governmental coordination centre and giving the government more authority in this sphere.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"this centre would dovetail the implementation of large projects with placement of contracts at russian companies, with further development of the national production and research facilities, and production localisation.as for imports, we must only buy distinctly unique equipment and technology abroad.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"i’d like to add that we must also cooperate with domestic producers when upgrading the housing and utility sector, public transport, agriculture and other industries.i am instructing the government to take the necessary decisions to expand small and medium-sized businesses’ access to purchases by state companies, and in particular to determine the volume of state-owned companies’ mandatory annual purchases from small and medium firms.",PAFA
Russia,2014,this is tens and hundreds of billions of rubles that must be used to boost the development of national businesses.it goes without saying that their products must satisfy the strictest quality and price conditions.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"next, we must prevent internal monopolism.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"i want to stress that reasonable import substitution – reasonable is the key word here – is a long-term priority, irrespective of external conditions.moreover, import substitution programmes must encourage the creation of a large group of industrial companies that can be competitive not only domestically but also on foreign markets.",PAFA
Russia,2014,these companies exist in russia.,PAFA
Russia,2014,they are highly efficient and have export potential – very good potential.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"but they are short of capital, technology, personnel and equipment.",PAFA
Russia,2014,we must remove as many of these restrictions as possible.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"we must provide investment incentives so that these companies can increase growth, increase their capitalisation and production severalfold and become established on foreign markets.i am instructing the agency for strategic initiatives to join forces with vnesheconombank, the russian direct investment fund and other development institutions to draft a relevant programme and system.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"the first pilot programme for the support for non-commodity companies must be launched already next year.the integrated credit and insurance export support centre, which will start operating in 2015, will stimulate domestic exports.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"its services will be available to all non-commodity companies, both big and small.in the next three years the capitalisation of roseximbank, which was created for this purpose, should reach approximately 30 billion rubles.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"in the next three years, the volume of russian high value-added exports should grow by 50 percent.of course, considerable funds will be needed for the development of the non-commodity and other economic sectors.",PAFA
Russia,2014,russia has these funds.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"we have large domestic savings, which must be used for this.despite any external restrictions, we must increase our annual investment to 25 percent of gdp by 2018.",PAFA
Russia,2014,what does this mean?,PAFA
Russia,2014,i’ll explain it with just a few words.it means that we must invest as much as we save.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"our savings must work for the national economy and development, rather than the export of capital.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"to be able to do this, we must seriously strengthen the stability of our banking system – the central bank has been working towards this end quite persistently – and also reduce the dependence of the national financial market on external risks.i propose using our reserves (above all, the national welfare fund) to implement a programme for recapitalisation of leading domestic banks, with funding to be provided under clearly specified conditions to be funnelled into the most significant projects in the real economy at affordable interest rates.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"furthermore, banks will have to introduce project financing mechanisms.regarding budget spending, the key requirements here should be thrift and maximum return, the correct choice of priorities and factoring in the current economic situation.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"for the next three years, we should set the goal of cutting costs and ineffective budget spending by at least five percent of total spending in real terms.a huge economic reserve is lying on the surface.",PAFA
Russia,2014,it is enough to look at government-financed construction projects to see this.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"at a recent forum of the russian popular front, examples were cited of funds being invested in grandiose buildings or the construction costs of same-type – i want to emphasise this point – facilities, differing several times over, even in neighbouring regions.i believe that it is necessary to phase in a system of a single technical contracting authority, and centralise the preparation of standard projects, construction documentation and the choice of subcontractors.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"this will make it possible to overcome the existing disparity in construction costs and ensure significant saving of public funds spent on capital construction projects, between 10 percent and 20 percent.",PAFA
Russia,2014,this practice should be extended to all civil construction projects financed from the federal budget.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"i instruct the government to submit relevant proposals.yesterday, the prime minister and i discussed this topic.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"of course, there are some pitfalls here, and knowing what they are, it is important to avoid them, move with caution, implement several pilot projects in several regions and see what happens.however, leaving the situation as it is today is no longer an option.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"as i said earlier, construction costs of similar facilities in neighbouring regions differ many times over.",PAFA
Russia,2014,what is this?,PAFA
Russia,2014,"diversion or embezzlement of budget funds allocated for federal defence contracts should be treated as a direct threat to national security and dealt with seriously and severely, as in the suppression of the financing of terrorism.",PAFA
Russia,2014,i mention this for a reason.i don’t think there is anything to hide or gloss over here.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"we have just held our regularl meeting in sochi with the leadership of the defence ministry, combat arms and services commanders and leading defence company designers.on certain positions, prices double, triple or quadruple, and in one case they grew 11 times.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"you realise that this has nothing to do with inflation or with anything, considering that practically 100 percent of funding is provided in advance.i would like to reiterate, and i’m bringing this to the attention of law enforcement agencies.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"i instruct the defence ministry, the federal service for financial monitoring and other relevant agencies to develop a system of strict, effective oversight over the use of funding allocated for federal defence contracts.",PAFA
Russia,2014,this system should operate along the entire supply chain.,PAFA
Russia,2014,tougher penalties should be imposed on those in charge of federal defence contract implementation for misspending every ruble from the budget.it is also crucial to streamline state-owned company budgets.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"to this end, unified financial settlement centres should be established therein, something like the treasury, to ensure the transparency and optimisation of financial flows and their effective management.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"parent companies should also clearly see how funds are used in their subsidiaries.key efficiency parameters should be introduced in all companies where the state holds over 50 percent of stock, including the requirement to reduce operating expenses by at least 2–3 percent a year.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"i should add that compensations to state company management should be directly related to performance and economic realities.colleagues,i’m confident that russia is capable not only of carrying out a large-scale effort to upgrade its industrial sector, but also of becoming a supplier of ideas and technology for the whole world, emerging as a leading producer of goods and services that would shape the global technology agenda.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"russian companies will embody national success and pride, just as our nuclear and space projects once did.we have already adopted legislative amendments to introduce strict environmental standards.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"their purpose is to push companies to implement the so-called best available technology, so that the key industries benefit from continuous upgrades.that said, we should also be mindful of future challenges.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"in this regard, i propose implementing a national technology initiative.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"long-term forecasts should provide us with insight into the tasks russia could face in the next 10–15 years, what state-of-the-art solutions will be needed to ensure national security, improve quality of life, and promote industries operating in a new technological environment.promoters of promising creative projects should join efforts with vibrant companies that are ready to implement cutting-edge solutions.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"the leading universities, research centres, the russian academy of sciences and major business associations should also be involved in this effort.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"and of course, our compatriots working abroad as academics or in high-tech sectors should also be invited to join in, but only those of them who actually have something to contribute.i propose that the government make the necessary arrangements, with assistance from the agency for strategic initiatives.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"it is important that business representatives, academics and developers tell us what barriers need to be removed and what additional assistance they require.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"the most advanced technologies will yield results only if there are people who are ready to develop and use them.unfortunately, engineers are still mostly educated at universities that are no longer linked to the actual producers, and lack access to the latest research and solutions.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"it is high time that we focus on the quality of education, not sheer enrolment numbers, and ensure that engineers are trained by top higher education institutions with strong industry connections, and preferably in the same regions where the future engineers will live.this quality requirement should also be applied to regular labour force.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"by 2020, at least half of russia’s vocational training colleges are expected to offer education in 50 of the most relevant and promising labour professions, in accordance with the highest international standards and using advanced technology.",PAFA
Russia,2014,contests among workers and engineers should also become an important indicator of the changes in vocational training.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"the system of professional contests is not new, and russia has joined it and has become a proactive member.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"this is not just about enhancing the prestige of engineering and labour jobs, but also an opportunity to be guided by the best practices in the training of such professionals.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"building on this experience, professional and educational standards can be devised.as you know, russia competes in various international professional contests.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"i don’t have the data on hand, so i’ll cite them by memory, since they are worth mentioning.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"three teams have been created: one with experts from leading enterprises, one with students and a third with 14 to 17 year old school students.",PAFA
Russia,2014,they have trained to perform various tasks of the same kind.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"the team of 14 to 17 year old school students was able to find the best solutions for the most complex tasks in the space industry, where they worked on spacecraft, as well in traditional industrial tasks, despite the fact that such tasks were designed for highly-skilled workers.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"school students beat university students, as well as workers from the leading companies, by a wide margin.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"what this means is that, first, we have great potential, a lot of young promising talent.",PAFA
Russia,2014,it also means that a lot has to be done to change the professional training system.,PAFA
Russia,2014,it’s what i spoke about.,PAFA
Russia,2014,we just need to avoid acting formally here.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"there is now a clear understanding of what should be done, so now we must just start doing it.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"once we engage in this effort, we must keep up the momentum, since despite the changes in labour professions and training, the key economic driver always was and will continue to be the availability of highly-skilled qualified workforce and engineers.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"a network of certification centres should be created so that workers can prove that they meet professional requirements.colleagues,i’ll move on to the next topic, which is demographics.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"in the early 2000s, un experts predicted further demographic decline in russia.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"according to un forecasts, the population of our country was supposed to shrink to 136 million people by the end of 2013.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"on january 1, 2014, the population of russia was almost 144 million people, 8 million more than forecast by the united nations.in addition, as you know, russia registered natural population growth for two years in a row in 2013 and 2014.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"it is expected that by late 2014, with crimea and sevastopol included, russia's population will exceed 146 million people.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"our demographic programmes have proved their effectiveness, and we will continue to implement them, with full coverage for the people of crimea and sevastopol.",PAFA
Russia,2014,families in crimea and sevastopol that have had a second or subsequent child since 2007 will receive the full amount of maternity capital.i would like to draw your attention to another important and meaningful fact.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"this year, russia was for the first time recognised as a successful country in world health rankings.",PAFA
Russia,2014,the average life expectancy in such countries exceeds 70 years.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"currently, this indicator in russia is over 71.",PAFA
Russia,2014,i believe that we have every opportunity to increase average life expectancy to 74 years in the near future and achieve a drastic reduction in mortality.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"that’s why i propose declaring 2015 the national year of fighting cardiovascular diseases, which is the leading cause of death, and combining the efforts of healthcare workers, representatives of culture, education, media, civic and sports organisations in order to resolve this problem.the 2014 winter olympics in sochi played an enormous role in promoting a healthy lifestyle.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"once again, i’d like to congratulate our olympians on their success.of course, the kindest words go to the paralympic athletes.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"friends, you have become true heroes of russia.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"largely thanks to you, attitudes towards people with disabilities have undergone a dramatic change.",PAFA
Russia,2014,i’m convinced that our society will become truly united when we provide equal opportunities to everyone.government programmes must include measures to provide vocational training and employment opportunities to people with disabilities and create a barrier-free environment in all spheres of life.,PAFA
Russia,2014,i suggest extending the accessible environment programme to 2020.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"we also need to create a modern domestic industry to manufacture goods for people with disabilities, including devices for physical therapy and rehabilitation.with regard to healthcare, it is imperative to complete the transition to an insurance-based system and to make sure all its mechanisms are working without a fault.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"we have been talking about it and working on it for quite a while now, but insurance-based medicine still isn’t working properly.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"importantly, both patients and medical staff should have a clear understanding of how health insurance works.",PAFA
Russia,2014,we must create a centralised system of public oversight over the quality of healthcare organisations with corresponding powers and levers.,PAFA
Russia,2014,i’d like to ask the government to amend the legislation accordingly.i also propose providing a special training certificate to doctors.,PAFA
Russia,2014,they will use it to choose the best educational programme for them in order to take advanced courses and improve their skills.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"the hours and methods of such training should be convenient for the doctors.even with the most advanced technological innovations in medicine, a doctor’s personal qualities remain important.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"that includes a focus on the patient, a noble attitude and commitment to their professional and moral duty.",PAFA
Russia,2014,such medical professionals are the backbone of our healthcare system.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"and we must create all the conditions for them to be able to do their job properly.colleagues, yesterday, for the first time in many years, students in russian schools wrote graduation compositions.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"this is another step towards a more objective system of evaluating the academic progress, knowledge, perspective and intellect of the younger generation and, importantly, the quality of the teachers’ work.i’d like to ask the ministry of education and science in conjunction with the professional community to review the results of these compositions and the national final school exam and come up with solutions aimed at increasing teachers’ accountability and motivating children to learn new skills.it should be noted that the national final school exam has allowed gifted children from remote towns and villages and low-income families to apply to the nation’s best universities.talented children are a valuable asset of the nation, and we need to provide additional support to young people who show an aptitude for technology, liberal arts or inventing at an early age, who have achieved success in national or international academic and professional contests, and have patents or publications in academic journals.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"we have many such young people.i propose establishing 5,000 annual presidential grants for talented young people who study at higher education institutions.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"each grant will be for 20,000 rubles a month.of course, certain conditions will apply for the duration of their studies at a higher education institution.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"first, such students must make a commitment to work for a certain time in russia, as targeted training programmes currently require.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"second, they would have to confirm their eligibility each year by demonstrating the necessary academic and personal achievements for the duration of their studies.every child and teenager in our country should be able to find something to do outside the classroom.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"any curtailment of extracurricular, supplemental education is unacceptable.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"art, technology and music centres help create well-rounded people.i’d like to ask the government and the regions to focus on this issue and come up with financial and organisational approaches to address it.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"most importantly, children and their parents should have a choice between getting additional education at school, a municipal centre of creativity, or a non-governmental educational organisation.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"importantly, all these options must be affordable and children must have access to classes taught by properly trained professionals.another important issue that i spoke about in last year’s address is overcrowded schools and classrooms.",PAFA
Russia,2014,we have crunched the numbers and found that we need to create an additional 4.5 million spots at schools.how did we arrive at this number?,PAFA
Russia,2014,"today, nearly two million schoolchildren attend the second shift.",PAFA
Russia,2014,there are schools with three shifts.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"in the coming years, with a growing birth rate (which we hope will continue), the number of pupils will increase by another 2.5 million.naturally, we also have to solve the issue highlighted in the executive orders signed in 2012, that of increasing the number of preschools, something we spoke about with our colleagues from the government yesterday.",PAFA
Russia,2014,this is the way it should be.,PAFA
Russia,2014,we have to consider all our opportunities and remember that one problem will intensify – that of spots at schools.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"i ask the government, together with the regional authorities, to develop a comprehensive approach to resolving these issues.colleagues,education, healthcare, and the social welfare system should become a true public benefit and serve all citizens of the country.",PAFA
Russia,2014,attention to the people cannot be faked.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"you cannot simulate teaching, medical assistance or social care.",PAFA
Russia,2014,we have to learn to feel respect for ourselves and honour reputation.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"it’s the reputation of individual hospitals, schools, universities and social institutions that form the country’s overall reputation.citizens don't have to think about where to apply for a social service: at a state, municipal or private organisation.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"they have the right to come to those who can provide professional assistance, with full dedication, putting their soul in their work.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"all the other things – including technical, organisational and legal issues concerning the provision of services – is the responsibility of the state, the responsibility to properly organise the work.we will continue to support socially oriented non-commercial organisations.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"such ngos, as a rule, bring together people who feel their civil duty and who are aware of how much mercy, attention, care and kindness mean.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"we should use their proposals and experience, especially when implementing social initiatives.we must not allow discrimination of the non-governmental sector in the social sphere and eliminate all barriers to it: not only legal ones, which have been mostly abolished, but also those that persist, i mean organisational and administrative barriers.",PAFA
Russia,2014,equal access should be provided for the non-governmental sector to financial resources.competition is a crucial factor to boost the quality of services in the social sphere.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"also, it is necessary to launch a mechanism of independent assessment of the quality of services and to ensure transparency of information on the work of agencies providing social services.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"i ask the russian popular front, together with civic associations, to assist the reforms in the social sector.following next year’s results, i plan to meet with representatives of the non-governmental sector.",PAFA
Russia,2014,we will discuss what changes we have succeeded in achieving lately.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"overall, we should considerably expand the opportunities for dialogue, for exchange of ideas between the government and the public, particularly the civic chamber and its regional branches.these structures should be incorporated, both at the federal and regional level, into a comprehensive expert examination of draft laws and government decisions, including at the level of the so-called initial reading, which should serve as an efficient feedback mechanism.we can see how active citizens are and what constructive efforts they are taking.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"not only are they highlighting issues for the authorities to tackle, they also actively participate in settling issues and problems.",PAFA
Russia,2014,they realise full well that much depends on their personal efforts.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"the will, deeds and generosity of these people make up the invaluable social potential of the nation.everyone who is prepared to take responsibility has to be involved in the implementation of the plans of developing the country, certain regions and municipalities.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"if the state and the public act as one, in an atmosphere of cooperation and mutual trust, success is guaranteed.i would like to address representatives of all political parties and social forces.",PAFA
Russia,2014,i am counting on our joint consolidated work.,PAFA
Russia,2014,"russia’s interests demand this unity and this work.friends, citizens of russia,i will conclude my address where i began it.",PAFA
Russia,2014,"this year, as has been the case many times during crucial historical moments, our people have demonstrated national enthusiasm, vital endurance and patriotism.",PAFA
Russia,2014,the difficulties we are facing today also create new opportunities for us.,PAFA
Russia,2014,we are ready to take up any challenge and win.thank you.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"citizens of russia, members of the federation council, state duma deputies,i would like to begin my address with words of gratitude to the russian servicemen who are fighting international terrorism.today here in the st george’s hall, a historic hall of russian military glory, we have combat pilots and representatives of the armed forces who are taking part in the anti-terrorist operation in syria.gelena peshkova and irina pozynich, who lost their husbands in the war against terror, have joined us too.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"my deepest respect to you and the parents of our heroes.i would like us all to honour the memory of the soldiers who gave their lives while doing their duty, and the memory of all russian citizens who fell at the hands of terrorists.(",PAFA
Russia,2015,"moment of silence)colleagues, russia has long been at the forefront of the fight against terrorism.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"this is a fight for freedom, truth and justice, for the lives of people and the future of the entire civilisation.we know what aggression of international terrorism is.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"russia faced it back in the mid-1990s, when our country, our civilian population suffered from cruel attacks.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"we will never forget the hostage crises in budennovsk, beslan and moscow, the merciless explosions in residential buildings, the nevsky express train derailment, the blasts in the moscow metro and domodedovo airport.these tragedies took thousands of lives.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"we still grieve for them and will always grieve, along with the victims’ loved ones.",PAFA
Russia,2015,it took us nearly a decade to finally break the backbone of those militants.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"we almost succeeded in expelling terrorists from russia, but are still fighting the remaining terrorist underground.",PAFA
Russia,2015,this evil is still out there.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"two years ago, two attacks were committed in volgograd.",PAFA
Russia,2015,a civilian russian plane was recently blown up over sinai.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"international terrorism will never be defeated by just one country, especially in a situation when the borders are practically open, and the world is going through another resettlement of peoples, while terrorists are getting regular financial support.terrorism is a growing threat today.",PAFA
Russia,2015,the afghanistan problem has not been resolved.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"the situation there is alarming and gives us no optimism, while some of the yet recently stable and rather well-doing countries in the middle east and north africa – iraq, libya and syria – have now plunged into chaos and anarchy that pose a threat to the whole world.we all know why that happened.",PAFA
Russia,2015,we know who decided to oust the unwanted regimes and brutally impose their own rules.,PAFA
Russia,2015,where has this led them?,PAFA
Russia,2015,"they stirred up trouble, destroyed the countries’ statehood, set people against each other, and then “washed their hands”, as we say in russia, thus opening the way to radical activists, extremists and terrorists.the militants in syria pose a particularly high threat for russia.",PAFA
Russia,2015,many of them are citizens of russia and the cis countries.,PAFA
Russia,2015,they get money and weapons and build up their strength.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"if they get sufficiently strong to win there, they will return to their home countries to sow fear and hatred, to blow up, kill and torture people.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"we must fight and eliminate them there, away from home.this is why it has been decided to launch a military operation there based on an official request from the legitimate syrian authorities.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"our military personnel are fighting in syria for russia, for the security of russian citizens.",PAFA
Russia,2015,the russian army and navy have convincingly demonstrated their combat readiness and their increased capabilities.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"modern russian weapons have proved to be effective, and the invaluable practice of using them in combat conditions is being analysed and will be used to further improve our weapons and military equipment.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"we are grateful to our engineers, workers and all other personnel of our defence companies.russia has demonstrated immense responsibility and leadership in the fight against terrorism.",PAFA
Russia,2015,russian people have supported these resolute actions.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"the firm stance taken by our people stems from a thorough understanding of the absolute danger of terrorism, from patriotism, high moral qualities and their firm belief that we must defend our national interests, history, traditions and values.the international community should have learned from the past lessons.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"the historical parallels in this case are undeniable.unwillingness to join forces against nazism in the 20th century cost us millions of lives in the bloodiest world war in human history.today we have again come face to face with a destructive and barbarous ideology, and we must not allow these modern-day dark forces to attain their goals.we must stop our debates and forget our differences to build a common anti-terrorist front that will act in line with international law and under the un aegis.every civilised country must contribute to the fight against terrorism, reaffirming their solidarity, not in word but in deed.this means that the terrorists must not be given refuge anywhere.",PAFA
Russia,2015,there must be no double standards.,PAFA
Russia,2015,no contacts with terrorist organisations.,PAFA
Russia,2015,no attempts to use them for self-seeking goals.,PAFA
Russia,2015,no criminal business with terrorists.we know who are stuffing pockets in turkey and letting terrorists prosper from the sale of oil they stole in syria.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"the terrorists are using these receipts to recruit mercenaries, buy weapons and plan inhuman terrorist attacks against russian citizens and against people in france, lebanon, mali and other states.",PAFA
Russia,2015,we remember that the militants who operated in the north caucasus in the 1990s and 2000s found refuge and received moral and material assistance in turkey.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"we still find them there.meanwhile, the turkish people are kind, hardworking and talented.",PAFA
Russia,2015,we have many good and reliable friends in turkey.,PAFA
Russia,2015,allow me to emphasise that they should know that we do not equate them with the certain part of the current ruling establishment that is directly responsible for the deaths of our servicemen in syria.we will never forget their collusion with terrorists.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"we have always deemed betrayal the worst and most shameful thing to do, and that will never change.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"i would like them to remember this – those in turkey who shot our pilots in the back, those hypocrites who tried to justify their actions and cover up for terrorists.",PAFA
Russia,2015,i don’t even understand why they did it.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"any issues they might have had, any problems, any disagreements even those we knew nothing about could have been settled in a different way.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"plus, we were ready to cooperate with turkey on all the most sensitive issues it had; we were willing to go further, where its allies refused to go.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"allah only knows, i suppose, why they did it.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"and probably, allah has decided to punish the ruling clique in turkey by taking their mind and reason.but, if they expected a nervous or hysterical reaction from us, if they wanted to see us become a danger to ourselves as much as to the world, they won’t get it.",PAFA
Russia,2015,they won’t get any response meant for show or even for immediate political gain.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"they won’t get it.our actions will always be guided primarily by responsibility – to ourselves, to our country, to our people.",PAFA
Russia,2015,we are not going to rattle the sabre.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"but, if someone thinks they can commit a heinous war crime, kill our people and get away with it, suffering nothing but a ban on tomato imports, or a few restrictions in construction or other industries, they’re delusional.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"we’ll remind them of what they did, more than once.",PAFA
Russia,2015,they’ll regret it.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"we know what to do.we have mobilised our armed forces, security services and law enforcement agencies to repel the terrorist threat.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"everyone must be aware of their responsibility, including the authorities, political parties, civil society organisations and the media.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"russia’s strength lies in the free development of all its peoples, its diversity, the harmony of cultures, languages and traditions, mutual respect for and dialogue between all faiths, including christians, muslims, judaists and buddhists.we must firmly resist any manifestation of extremism and xenophobia while defending our ethnic and religious accord, which is the historical foundation of our society and the russian statehood.in 2016 we will hold elections to the state duma.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"i would like to remind party leaders, all participants of the upcoming election campaign and all the social and political forces about the following words of our famous historian, nikolai karamzin: “those who have no respect for themselves cannot hope to be respected by others.",PAFA
Russia,2015,that does not mean that love for our homeland must blind us into saying that we are better than all others in everything we do.,PAFA
Russia,2015,but russians must know their value.”,PAFA
Russia,2015,"yes, we can debate ways to solve this or that issue.",PAFA
Russia,2015,but we must remain united and remember what is most important for us: russia.the election campaign must be honest and transparent and respect the law and the electorate.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"at the same time, it must be conducted so as to win public trust in the election results and legitimacy.colleagues, i expect that a considerable part of the parliamentary candidates’ election programmes will be devoted to the issue of corruption, which is a major concern for society.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"corruption is hindering russia’s development.officials, judges, law enforcement officers and deputies at all levels are obliged to submit their income and expense declarations and declare their property and assets, including outside russia.from now on, state and municipal officials will also have to disclose information about the contracts they plan to sign with the companies of their relatives and friends.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"situations with a possible conflict of interest will be closely monitored by the regulatory and law enforcement authorities, as well as civil society.just recently participants in the russian popular front’s project for fair public procurement told me about the instances of abuse and blatant violations they have uncovered.",PAFA
Russia,2015,i ask the prosecutor general’s office and the law enforcement authorities to promptly react to this information.the law must be hard on those who are guilty of premeditated crimes against human lives and the interests of society and the state.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"but the law must be lenient to those who have slipped up.today, nearly half of the criminal cases brought to court concern petty crimes or misdemeanours, but those who committed them, including very young people, go to prison for them.a prison term and even a prison record usually have a highly negative impact on these people’s lives, often creating a situation in which they commit new crimes.i ask the state duma to approve the supreme court’s proposal that some offences in the criminal code are decriminalised and that misdemeanour is reclassified as an administrative offence, with an important reservation: a repeated offence must be classified as a criminal act.we must also work to enhance the independence and objectivity of our courts.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"in light of this, i suggest strengthening the role of juries and expanding the list of crimes that can be submitted to them.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"it’s not always easy to find 12 jurors, and although i know the position of human rights organisations, which insist on 12-member juries, forming such juries is not easy and it is also expensive.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"therefore, i suggest cutting the number of jury members from 12 to 5–7, on the condition that they take their decisions autonomously and independently.colleagues, last year we faced some serious economic challenges.",PAFA
Russia,2015,oil and other products we traditionally offer for export fell in price.,PAFA
Russia,2015,the access of russian financial institutions and companies to global financial markets was restricted.,PAFA
Russia,2015,i know that many people are experiencing hardships today.,PAFA
Russia,2015,these economic issues are affecting incomes and the general quality of life.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"i understand very well that people are wondering when we are going to overcome these hardships and what needs to be done in order to accomplish this.the current situation is complicated but, as i have said before, not critical.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"in fact, we can already see some positive trends.",PAFA
Russia,2015,industrial production and the national currency are generally steady.,PAFA
Russia,2015,there is a slight decline in inflation.,PAFA
Russia,2015,we can see a significantly lower capital flight as compared to 2014.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"however, this doesn’t mean that we just calm down and wait for everything to miraculously change, or that we can just sit quietly in expectation of rising oil prices.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"essentially, such an approach would be unacceptable.",PAFA
Russia,2015,we must be prepared for low commodity prices and external restrictions to last much longer.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"by changing nothing, we will simply run out of reserves and the economic growth rates will linger around zero.this is not the only issue to consider.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"busy with the immediate tasks, we must not overlook general global development trends.",PAFA
Russia,2015,the global economy is rapidly changing shape.,PAFA
Russia,2015,new trade associations are forming.,PAFA
Russia,2015,we are experiencing a period of radical change in the sphere of technology.this is a crucial moment when countries need to compete to secure their roles in the global division of labour for decades ahead.,PAFA
Russia,2015,we can and must become one of the leaders.,PAFA
Russia,2015,russia has no right to be vulnerable.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"we must have a strong economy, excel in technology and advance our professional skills.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"we must fully use our current advantages, as there are no guarantees that we will have them tomorrow.clearly, the authorities must hear the public out and explain the nature of the problems people face and the reasons behind the government’s actions, treating civil society and business as equal partners.what areas should we focus on?",PAFA
Russia,2015,"first, competitive manufacturing is still concentrated mostly in the commodities and mining sector.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"we’ll only be able to achieve our ambitious goals in security and social development, to create modern jobs and improve the living standards of millions of our people if we change the structure of our economy.importantly, we do have effective industrial and agricultural operations, as well as small and medium-sized businesses.",PAFA
Russia,2015,our goal is to have the number of these kinds of companies grow fast in all sectors.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"our programmes for import substitution and export support, manufacturing retrofitting and professional training should be geared to achieving this goal.second, we need to bear in mind that a number of industries are now at risk, including primarily the construction, automotive, and light industries, as well as railway engineering.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"to address this, the government will need to come up with special support programmes.",PAFA
Russia,2015,financial resources for this purpose have been set aside.third.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"it is imperative to support low-income households and socially vulnerable groups of citizens, and finally adopt fair principles of providing social assistance that is made available to those who really need it.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"in particular, it is necessary to take into account the individual needs of people with disabilities, and focus on their training and employment.we have done a lot to improve demography, education, and healthcare.",PAFA
Russia,2015,the key benchmarks in these areas were outlined in the corresponding executive orders of may 2012.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"of course, life is ever changing, and, given current complications, our responsibility for people’s welfare only increases, so i’d like to ask you to take these executive orders seriously.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"we must strive to fulfil them.fourth, it is imperative to achieve a balanced budget.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"this, of course, is not an end in itself, but a critical prerequisite for macroeconomic stability and our financial independence.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"as you may recall, by the end of the 2016 federal budget year, the deficit should not exceed 3 percent, even if revenue is lower than expected.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"please take a note of this, colleagues, members of the state duma and the federation council, the federal assembly in general.",PAFA
Russia,2015,this is important.,PAFA
Russia,2015,i just mentioned that financial stability and the independence of our country are completely interrelated.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"please keep these basic considerations in mind.budget planning, in fact, planning each budget cycle must begin with a clear identification of priorities.",PAFA
Russia,2015,we must make government programmes play the decisive role in this process again.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"it is essential that we tighten our control over public funds, including federal and regional subsidies to industrial and agricultural enterprises.",PAFA
Russia,2015,i believe that they should be transferred to the end user only through treasury accounts.,PAFA
Russia,2015,government revenue must be used strictly as planned.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"”grey“ schemes used in paying customs duties, excise taxes on alcohol, tobacco, and fuels and lubricants siphon off hundreds of billions of rubles from the budget annually.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"this is outright theft.i propose forming a single system for administering tax, customs and other fiscal payments.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"there are a variety of options to go about this, and we have discussed them on many occasions.",PAFA
Russia,2015,i expect the government to submit specific proposals.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"here again, i would like to emphasise that the tax environment for business should remain unchanged in the coming years.fifth.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"we need to further strengthen trust between the government and business, to improve the business climate in russia.this year we have mostly completed the plans outlined in the national entrepreneurial initiative.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"the dynamics are good, but we certainly shouldn’t stop yet.the government, together with the agency for strategic initiatives and leading business associations, should continue their systematic work to improve the conditions for doing business, constantly monitoring how laws are carried out locally.",PAFA
Russia,2015,i believe free enterprise to be the most important aspect of economic and social well-being.,PAFA
Russia,2015,entrepreneurial freedom is something we need to expand to respond to all attempts to impose restrictions on us.that is why we have given such a broad authority to the newly created federal corporation for the development of small and medium business.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"i would like to ask all ministries, departments, governors, heads of all russian regions, state-owned companies and banks to provide all the necessary assistance to it.polls show that businesses see no qualitative progress in the regulators’ work.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"yet, all the necessary instructions for this have been issued, even more than once.",PAFA
Russia,2015,we repeat ourselves and our attempts to reduce their powers.,PAFA
Russia,2015,we reduce them in one area – they simply grow again in another.,PAFA
Russia,2015,a whole army of inspectors continues to hinder the operation of good businesses.,PAFA
Russia,2015,i am not saying that control is not necessary.,PAFA
Russia,2015,business does require regulation.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"but i ask the government commission for administrative reform to work out, together with business associations, proposals on eliminating redundant and overlapping functions of regulatory agencies, and submit them by july 1, 2016.",PAFA
Russia,2015,i would like to cite some figures supplied by one of our business associations.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"during 2014, the investigative authorities opened nearly 200,000 cases on so-called economic crimes.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"but only 46,000 of 200,000 cases were actually taken to court, and 15,000 cases were thrown out during the hearings.",PAFA
Russia,2015,simple math suggests that only 15 percent of all cases ended with a conviction.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"at the same time, the vast majority, over 80 percent, or specifically, 83 percent of entrepreneurs who faced criminal charges fully or partially lost their business – they got harassed, intimidated, robbed and then released.",PAFA
Russia,2015,this certainly isn’t what we need in terms of a business climate.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"this is actually the opposite, the direct destruction of the business climate.",PAFA
Russia,2015,i ask the investigative authorities and the prosecutor’s office to pay special attention to this.i would like to emphasise that prosecutors should make greater use of the tools available to check the quality of investigations.,PAFA
Russia,2015,i know that discussions have been going on for a long time about the prosecutor office’s needs.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"as you know, we have separated the investigative authorities and the prosecutor's office in order to ensure independent investigations are carried out; it was a conscious decision.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"today, i remind you, the prosecutor’s office has the authority to cancel a decision to institute criminal proceedings, or waive the indictment, or even refuse to support the case in court.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"we must learn to use what is available; only then we will be able to analyse what is happening in practice.in addition, i believe that suspects in economic cases should be detained only as a last resort measure; for the most part investigators should opt for release on bail, travel restrictions or house arrest.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"the role of law enforcement and the judicial system is to protect the economy and community from fraud and criminals, and to protect the rights, property and dignity of all those who obey the law and conduct their business honestly.there is one more point i’d like to make.",PAFA
Russia,2015,last year we announced the so-called capital amnesty to return financial assets to russia.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"yet, businesses seem in no hurry to take advantage of that opportunity, which suggests that the procedure proposed is too complicated, while guarantees it provides are still insufficient.",PAFA
Russia,2015,i follow the public discussions on the issue.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"the word is, that what we have already done and the decisions we made previously are slightly better than the solutions we’ve offered in years past, but it is definitely not enough today.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"i ask the government to organise consultations, including further consultations with the business community, with the supreme court, with law enforcement agencies, and in short order make the appropriate adjustments.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"i also suggest extending the capital amnesty itself for another six months.colleagues, the state will fund the necessary assistance to those who are ready to go forward and become leaders.",PAFA
Russia,2015,we are building such a system in our dialogue with the business community based on its requirements and the tasks facing our country.the industry development fund is already supporting import substitution programmes.,PAFA
Russia,2015,these programmes are needed by entrepreneurs.,PAFA
Russia,2015,i suggest increasing its authorised capital by another 20 billion roubles.we are also guaranteeing stable tax rates and other basic terms for investors who are ready to finance import substitution projects.,PAFA
Russia,2015,this is included in mechanisms such as the special investment contract.,PAFA
Russia,2015,i suggest granting the regions the right to reduce profit tax to zero under such contracts.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"some governors directly request this to allow investors to cover their capital outlays on developing new production lines.obviously, we are aware of the regional governors’ concerns.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"the regions should be motivated to consolidate their economic base, so an increase in regional profits from implementing these projects should not lead to a reduction in federal subsidies.we are ready to guarantee the demand for the goods produced under these programmes and projects.",PAFA
Russia,2015,i propose giving the government the right to purchase on a non-competitive basis up to 30 percent of the products manufactured under special investment contracts.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"whatever remains should go to the free markets, including those abroad, to motivate these companies, to monitor the quality of their products and reduce overheads.as you know, when other countries carried out these kinds of programmes, the terms for state support were even tougher: it was mandatory for a certain percentage of goods produced to be sold abroad.",PAFA
Russia,2015,what for?,PAFA
Russia,2015,to motivate producers to manufacture quality products.we’re saying that we will guarantee demand in our own market.,PAFA
Russia,2015,our terms are somewhat different from those in other countries with tougher terms.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"that said, we must assume that these products will be highly competitive on the international market.",PAFA
Russia,2015,let me emphasise again that we will support expressly competitive domestic production lines.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"no one should be working under the illusion that under the guise of import substitution it’s possible to build a substandard, out of date product and pawn it off to the state or to our people and make them pay a premium price for it.",PAFA
Russia,2015,russia needs companies that are capable not only of providing the country with quality products but also of taking on foreign markets.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"the russian export centre was established to help those who are ready for this effort.in addition, i suggest making the growth of non-energy exports one of the key indicators of the performance of industry-related agencies and the government as a whole.i think it would be appropriate to implement the business community’s initiative and create a technological development agency to help companies acquire domestic and foreign patents and licenses for engineering services.",PAFA
Russia,2015,access to foreign markets and the expansion of russian manufacturing should become a natural strategy for the development of the nation’s business sector and the entire russian economy.,PAFA
Russia,2015,we should put stereotypes aside and believe in our own capabilities.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"if we work with this attitude, we are certain to see a result.our agriculture sector is a positive example.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"just a decade ago we imported almost half of our food products and critically depended on imports, whereas now russia has joined the exporters’ club.",PAFA
Russia,2015,last year russia’s agricultural exports totalled almost $20 billion.,PAFA
Russia,2015,this is a quarter more than our proceeds from arms sales or about one third of our profits from gas exports.,PAFA
Russia,2015,our agriculture has made this leap in a short but productive period.,PAFA
Russia,2015,many thanks to our rural residents.i believe we should set a national goal — fully provide the internal market with domestically produced foods by 2020.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"we are capable of feeding ourselves from our own land, and importantly, we have the water resources.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"russia can become one of the world’s largest suppliers of healthy, ecologically clean quality foods that some western companies have stopped producing long ago, all the more so since global demand for such products continues to grow.to fulfil these ambitious goals, we need to concentrate our resources on primary support for highly efficient farms.",PAFA
Russia,2015,this approach should underlie the programme for the development of the agro-industrial complex.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"this includes large, medium and small companies – all of them must be efficient.",PAFA
Russia,2015,i would like the agriculture ministry to pay special attention to this.it is necessary to put to use millions of hectares of arable land that is now idle.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"they belong to large land owners, many of whom show little interest in farming.",PAFA
Russia,2015,how many years have we been talking about this?,PAFA
Russia,2015,yet things are not moving forward.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"i suggest withdrawing misused agricultural land from questionable owners and selling it at an auction to those who can and want to cultivate the land.i would like to ask the government to prepare specific proposals, including draft regulations and standards by june 1, 2016.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"i would also like to ask the state duma deputies and all members of the federal assembly to make amendments to the related laws over the next year and adopt laws to make this possible at the next autumn session.we also need our own technology for the production, storage and processing of agricultural produce, our own seed and pedigree stock.",PAFA
Russia,2015,this is a very important goal.,PAFA
Russia,2015,we are still vulnerable in these areas.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"i ask you to get leading research centres, the russian academy of sciences and businesses which are successfully putting advanced technology into practice involved in this process.in my previous address, i announced the launch of the national technology initiative, spanning 15–20 years, but practical work is already underway.",PAFA
Russia,2015,it shows that we have plenty of strong teams capable of offering and following through on innovative ideas.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"in areas such as neutron technology, robotics in aviation and the transport sector in general, energy storage and distribution systems, russia has every chance of breaking through to global markets in the near future, within the next few years.development institutions should be geared towards achieving priority goals, primarily those related to technological modernisation.",PAFA
Russia,2015,we have over two dozen of them.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"unfortunately, many of them, to put it bluntly, have turned into dumping grounds for bad debts.",PAFA
Russia,2015,it is essential to streamline them and optimise the structure and mechanisms of this work.,PAFA
Russia,2015,i know that both the government and the central bank are actively working on this.we should make a more active use of the investment potential of domestic savings for economic modernisation.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"i ask the central bank and the government to submit proposals on the development of the corporate bond market, something we have discussed many times.",PAFA
Russia,2015,it is essential to simplify the procedure for the issue and acquisition of corporate bonds.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"to make it worthwhile for investors, individuals to invest in the development of the domestic real sector, i propose exempting the coupon income on these bonds from taxation, including from income tax for individuals.dozens of major projects are being implemented or are about to be launched in industry, agriculture, transport and housing construction.",PAFA
Russia,2015,they should have a positive impact not only on separate sectors but also stimulate the comprehensive development of entire territories.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"these are primarily private projects.to expedite their effective implementation it is important to make pinpoint amendments to laws, lift administrative barriers and assist the development of infrastructure and the process of entering foreign markets.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"these issues often extend beyond the scope of just one government agency, so i propose putting in place a mechanism to support the most important projects.",PAFA
Russia,2015,a special agency can be established for this.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"i ask prime minister dmitry medvedev to submit proposals on the work of this agency.incidentally, one such project could be the creation of major private russian companies that specialise in online trade so that russian goods are delivered via the internet to all countries in the world.",PAFA
Russia,2015,we do have a great deal to deliver.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"colleagues, we are interested in broad business cooperation with our foreign partners, and we welcome investors who focus on long-term work on the russian market, even though the current circumstances they face aren’t always favourable.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"we highly appreciate their positive attitude to our country, and the fact that they see advantages for growing their respective businesses in our country.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"russia is involved in integration processes designed to open additional avenues for expanding economic ties with other countries.we have reached the next level of cooperation within the eurasian economic union by creating a common space, with free movement of capital, goods and labour.",PAFA
Russia,2015,we have reached a basic agreement on combining eurasian integration with the chinese silk road economic belt.,PAFA
Russia,2015,a free trade zone with vietnam was established.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"next year, we will host the russia-asean summit in sochi, and i am sure we will be able to work out a mutually beneficial agenda for cooperation.i propose holding consultations, in conjunction with our colleagues from the eurasian economic union, with the sco and asean members, as well as with the states that are about to join the sco, with the view of potentially forming an economic partnership.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"together, our states make up nearly a third of the global economy in terms of purchasing power parity.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"such a partnership could initially focus on protecting investments, streamlining procedures for the cross-border movement of goods, joint development of technical standards for next-generation technology products, and the mutual provision of access to markets for both services and capital.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"of course, this partnership should be based on principles of equality and mutual interest.for russia, this partnership will open new possibilities for increasing exports of food and energy, as well as offering services in engineering, education, healthcare, and tourism to the asia-pacific region, allowing us to play the leading role in forming new technology markets, and re-orienting major global trade flows to russia.we will continue to upgrade our transport infrastructure and expand major logistic centres, such as the azov-black sea and the murmansk transport hubs, modern ports in the baltic sea and the russian far east.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"we will consolidate the system of inter-regional air transport, including in northern and arctic regions.",PAFA
Russia,2015,we will review in detail the situation with inland waterways and river routes during a forthcoming state council meeting.the northern sea route should become a link between europe and the asia-pacific region.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"to enhance its competitiveness, we will extend the preferential regime of the free port of vladivostok to key far eastern harbours, as requested by the entrepreneurs who operate in this strategically important russian region.the socioeconomic development of this region is a major national priority.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"investors have shown great practical interest in the new methods of operation we have proposed, including priority development areas.i instruct the government to expedite decisions on levelling off energy rates for the far eastern regions where they are considerably above average national rates, and i urge the parliament to promptly hear the draft law on the free allocation of land plots to people in the far east.over the past few years, major investments have been made in the development of khabarovsk and vladivostok, and people there have noticed the improvements.",PAFA
Russia,2015,komsomolsk-on-amur must become one more rapidly developing centre in the far east.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"it is a city with a rich history and modern high-tech industries, which turn out civilian products that enjoy high demand and also work fruitfully for the defence sector.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"but this city’s urban and social infrastructure has been neglected.i’m referring to the city’s face and its sports, culture, healthcare and education facilities, none of which are consistent with the potential of komsomolsk-on-amur.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"this is why it is difficult to attract talented young professionals there, which the regional companies badly need.",PAFA
Russia,2015,i believe that we can use resources under the on-going programmes to address the problems of komsomolsk-on-amur without delay.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"of course, we can’t do this overnight, but we at least must understand what we need to accomplish and how fast work must proceed.colleagues, we have a long-term agenda that must be independent of election cycles and the prevailing situation.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"these strategic goals include preserving the nation, bringing up our children and helping them develop their talents, which constitutes the basis of the power and future of any country, including russia.i’d like to begin with demography.",PAFA
Russia,2015,we’ve registered a natural increase in population for the past three years.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"it has been modest, but present nevertheless.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"what i would like to highlight is that, according to forecasts, we should have seen a demographic collapse due to the demographic echo of the 1990s, which demographers have predicted, including at the un.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"but this hasn’t come to pass, primarily because half of the new-borns today are second or third children.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"russian families want to have children, they believe in their future and in their country, and they are confident that the state will help them.",PAFA
Russia,2015,the maternity capital programme ends next year.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"over 6.5 million families have enjoyed its benefits, including in crimea and sevastopol.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"but we know that our efforts in this sphere have not been sufficient to close the demographic wound of the past.of course, we realise that this will be hard on the budget, that the programme needs major funding.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"we said in the past that we need to analyse the figures to see if we can shoulder this burden, as the financiers say, if we can guarantee the payment of these allocations.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"yes, we can do this, despite the current challenges.",PAFA
Russia,2015,i believe that we must extend the maternity capital programme for at least two years.a major demographic policy measure is the development of preschool education.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"over the past three years, 800,000 new places have been created at kindergartens.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"practically in all parts of russia, such institutions are available for children between the ages of three and seven.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"i know that the prime minister has paid special, personal attention to this.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"thank you, mr medvedev.however, so far, individual families – many families – continue to encounter problems placing children in kindergartens.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"as long as these problems exist, we cannot say that the issue has been closed.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"i ask both the government and regional authorities to pay special attention to this.now, healthcare.",PAFA
Russia,2015,the main achievement of our entire policy in this sphere is that we are seeing an increase in average life expectancy.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"over the past decade, it has increased by more than five years and this year, according to preliminary estimates, should exceed 71 years.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"nevertheless, there are still quite a few problems that have to be dealt with.next year, the russian healthcare system will transition completely to an insurance-based system.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"it is the direct responsibility of insurance companies operating in the compulsory medical insurance system to uphold patients’ rights, including in situations where they are refused free medical care without a reason.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"if an insurance company does not do this, it should be held accountable, including being banned from working in the compulsory medical insurance system.",PAFA
Russia,2015,i ask the government to ensure stringent oversight in this regard.next.,PAFA
Russia,2015,we have significantly expanded the scope of high-tech medical care.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"it may be recalled that in 2005, 60,000 high-tech operations were performed in russia – 60,000! – compared to 715,000 in 2014.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"for the first time in the country’s history, a significant part of such operations are carried out without there being a waiting list, and this is indeed a major achievement.however, it is important to understand that certain operations are expensive.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"as a general rule, they are performed at leading federal medical centres and clinics.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"to finance such operations, i propose establishing within the compulsory medical insurance system… we have thought about this a great deal – whether we should provide additional funding to the system.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"the deputies, government ministers and governors know what happens in reality.",PAFA
Russia,2015,the compulsory medical insurance system is a territorial system and it supports primarily territorial healthcare institutions.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"naturally, underfinancing is a matter of concern for the heads of major federal clinics, where the majority of high-tech operations are in fact performed.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"so, to finance these centres and perform such operations, i propose instituting a special federal component within the compulsory medical insurance system.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"i request that the relevant amendments to the law be adopted during the spring session.even so, this is not enough because people must not suffer while we make these decisions.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"it is necessary to ensure continuous financing of high-tech medical care, including with direct support from the federal budget until this decision is made.as you also know, the ambulance service has been significantly upgraded as part of the healthcare national project.",PAFA
Russia,2015,we have procured a large number of modern ambulance vehicles and other equipment.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"naturally, as time goes on, the auto fleet needs maintenance and renovation.",PAFA
Russia,2015,ten years have passed.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"this is the regions’ responsibility and they are duty bound to fulfil this task and find the necessary reserves.when we did this 10 years ago, i remember well, we agreed that we will make an initial injection of federal funding, and then the regions will take over the responsibility and keep the financing at a certain level.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"but this never happened, which is unfortunate.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"i understand that there may be issues, but like i said many times before, it is imperative to get our priorities straight.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"it was the wrong thing to do to wait for everything to fall apart, and then expect to be bailed out again with the money from the federal budget.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"however, the way things are now, it looks like we will have to do it again.",PAFA
Russia,2015,but that's not what we agreed upon.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"in any case, i ask the government and the regional authorities to get back to this issue and resolve it jointly.people are complaining that they often cannot understand why certain hospitals, schools, cultural or social centres and institutions are being closed or merged.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"we keep talking about the need to restructure the network, which is, in some cases, oversized.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"yes, that’s a fact.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"but we must proceed very carefully and be fully aware of the fact that in order for us to be able to reach certain indicators, closing rural medical centres is not always the best option.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"unfortunately, such things happen.",PAFA
Russia,2015,people then have to travel 100 kilometres to get medical attention.,PAFA
Russia,2015,this is outrageous!,PAFA
Russia,2015,please make sure that things are done right.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"i ask the government to draft and adopt a methodology for the most efficient distribution of social institutions by march 1, 2016.",PAFA
Russia,2015,it should be mandatory for use in the regions.,PAFA
Russia,2015,we must find a legally valid formula that will allow us to do so.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"in matters such as providing assistance to the elderly or people with disabilities, or supporting families and children, it is imperative to show more trust in civil society and non-profit organisations.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"often, they work more effectively and efficiently, showing genuine concern for the people.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"also, there’s less red tape in their work.i would like to propose a number of concrete solutions based on the results of the active citizens’ forum community, which took place in november.first, we will launch a special programme of presidential grants to support non-profit organisations working in small towns and villages.second, the non-profit organisations that have established themselves as reliable partners of the state will receive the legal status of a ”non-profit organisation – provider of socially useful services,“ and a number of incentives and preferences.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"finally, i believe that making up to 10 percent of the regional and municipal social programmes’ funding available to non-profit organisations is the right thing to do.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"that way, non-profit organisations will be able to participate in providing social services that are financed from the budget.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"we believe we know well the current legislation, and we are not imposing anything on anyone, but i’d like to ask heads of the regions and municipalities to bear this in mind in their work.colleagues, as you may recall, there was a meeting with children in sochi at the sirius centre for gifted children on september 1.",PAFA
Russia,2015,our children and young adults are really interesting and goal-oriented people.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"we must do our best to make sure that today's students get an excellent education, have opportunities to be creative, choose a profession to their liking, and are able to self-actualise regardless of their geographical location or level of their parents’ income.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"all children must have equal opportunities for a successful start in life.every year, schools have more and more students.",PAFA
Russia,2015,there will be 3.5 million more of them over the next decade.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"it's great, it's very good, but it is also important to make sure that this increase does not affect the quality of education and learning conditions, and that the current level continues to improve.",PAFA
Russia,2015,schools need more space for students.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"i asked the government to put together, in conjunction with the regions, a specific plan of action in this regard.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"a decision was made to release up to 50 billion rubles from the federal budget next year to repair, renovate and build new schools.i suggest we take a broader look at these issues.",PAFA
Russia,2015,comfortable buildings are not enough to get a good education.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"we need professional and motivated teachers, ground-breaking educational programmes and, of course, opportunities for the children to engage in creative activities, sports and extracurricular activities.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"of course, we should use the best of what former palaces of pioneers and young technicians' clubs had to offer.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"we must build our work on an innovative and up-to-date foundation with the participation of businesses, higher education institutions and universities.i will now note a positive fact, such as the growing interest of young people in engineering jobs and blue-collar occupations, the vocations of the future.",PAFA
Russia,2015,competition for enrolment in engineering universities has almost doubled in the past two years.,PAFA
Russia,2015,the worldskills international (wsi) will take place in kazan in 2019.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"by the way, russia was the first to hold such contests for young people aged 10 to 17 years.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"it is important to make sure that such tournaments become a road map for school children, for those who are just choosing their trades.",PAFA
Russia,2015,we must establish a whole system of national competitions for blue-collar workers.,PAFA
Russia,2015,i suggest we call this system “the young professionals.”,PAFA
Russia,2015,"this is a very important task.in a nutshell, russian schools, additional and professional education, and support for children’s creative work should be aligned with the country’s future, the requirements of people, young people in this case, and the demands of the economy in the context of its prospects.",PAFA
Russia,2015,these guys will have to resolve even more complicated tasks and should be ready to be the best.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"they should become not only successful in their careers but also simply decent people with a firm moral and ethical background.colleagues, we have repeatedly faced a historical choice of which road to take to further development.",PAFA
Russia,2015,we crossed another milestone in 2014 when crimea and sevastopol were reunified with russia.,PAFA
Russia,2015,"russia declared a voce piena its status as a strong state with a millennium-long history and great traditions, as a nation consolidated by common values and common goals.we are acting with the same confidence now, at a time when russia is waging an expressly open, direct struggle against international terrorism.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"we are making and implementing decisions, knowing that only we can cope with the tasks facing us, but only if we act together.i will cite a quotation that seemed stunning even to me.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"these words were said by a man who was far removed from politics, dmitry mendeleyev, who expressed these thoughts more than a hundred years ago: “we will be immediately destroyed if we are divided.",PAFA
Russia,2015,"our strength lies in our unity, our warriors, our benign domesticity that multiplies the numbers of our people; our strength lies in the natural growth of our intrinsic wealth and love of peace.”",PAFA
Russia,2015,these are wonderful words that are pertinent to us today.at the same time russia is a part of a global world that is changing rapidly.,PAFA
Russia,2015,we understand well the complexity and scale of existing problems – both foreign and domestic.,PAFA
Russia,2015,there are always difficulties and obstacles on the path to progress and development.,PAFA
Russia,2015,we will respond to all challenges; we will be creative and productive; we will work for the common good and for the sake of russia.,PAFA
Russia,2015,we will move forward in unity and working together we will achieve success.,PAFA
Russia,2015,thank you.(,PAFA
Russia,2015,anthem of the russian federation.),PAFA
Russia,2016,"good afternoon colleagues, members of the federation council, state duma deputies, citizens of russia, today, as usual in these annual addresses, i will speak about our tasks in the economy, the social sector, domestic and foreign policy.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"this year’s address will focus particularly on the economy, social issues, and domestic policy.we have to address all of these different matters in complicated and highly unusual conditions, which is not a unique event in our history.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"the people of russia have shown convincingly once again that they can rise to the difficult challenges and protect and defend their national interests, sovereignty, and independent course.colleagues, i have already said publicly on other occasions what i want to say today, but let me say it again now.",PAFA
Russia,2016,our people have united around patriotic values.,PAFA
Russia,2016,we see this unity and we should thank them for it.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"they have united around these values not because everyone is happy and they have no demands, on the contrary, there is no shortage of problems and difficulties.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"but people have an understanding of their causes and, most importantly, are confident that together we can overcome these problems.",PAFA
Russia,2016,it is this readiness to work for our country’s sake and this sincere and deep-seated concern for russia that form the foundation of this unity we see.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"people expect at the same time to have broad and equal opportunities for self-realisation and for making reality their business, creative, and civil initiatives.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"they expect respect for their person, their rights, freedoms, and labour.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"the principles of justice, respect, and trust are universal.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"we are consistent in defending these principles on the international stage, and, as we see, not without result.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"but we must put the same effort into guaranteeing these principles here at home, with regard to every individual and to society as a whole.people take any injustice and untruth very much to heart.",PAFA
Russia,2016,this is a distinguishing feature of our culture in general.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"our society resolutely rejects arrogance, conceit, insolence and selfishness, no matter in who they see it.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"our people place greater value on qualities such as responsibility, high moral standards, concern for public interests, and readiness to listen to others and respect their opinion.this was reflected in the election campaign that took place this year.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"as you know, i supported in my 2012 address the idea of returning to a mixed model for elections to the state duma.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"this was a principled step towards meeting public opinion’s demands.i think that our course of developing the political system, the institutions of direct democracy, and of making elections more competitive is completely justified, and will certainly continue.the state duma has bolstered its role as a representative body and the legislative branch of power’s authority has strengthened in general.",PAFA
Russia,2016,we must support and confirm this with concrete action.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"this concerns all political forces represented in the parliament.united russia, of course, bears particular responsibility here.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"incidentally, the party is celebrating its 15th anniversary at this time.",PAFA
Russia,2016,united russia has a constitutional majority in the state duma and is the government’s main support in the parliament.,PAFA
Russia,2016,we must organise work together in such a way as to ensure that all promises and commitments made to our people are honoured.,PAFA
Russia,2016,our people decided the election campaign’s result and chose the road of constructive development.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"they proved that we live in a healthy society that is confident in its fair and just demands, has ever stronger immunity against populism and demagogy, and values highly the importance of solidarity, closeness and unity.i am not talking, of course, about any kind of dogmas or a false unity put on for show, and i am certainly not talking about imposing a particular world view.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"we have already gone through all of this in our history, as you know, and we have no intention of returning to the past.",PAFA
Russia,2016,but this does not mean that we can juggle eloquent words and use talk of freedom as a cover for insulting others’ feelings and national traditions.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"someone might consider themselves more progressive, intelligent and cleverer than someone else, but if this is the case, be respectful towards others, and this would be the natural thing to do.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"at the same time, i think it is unacceptable to take an aggressive attitude in return, all the more so if it degenerates into vandalism and breaking the law.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"the state authorities will respond with firmness to such cases.tomorrow, the council for culture will meet, and we will certainly discuss these issues that provoke broad discussion, and will talk about the principles of mutual responsibility of civil society representatives and arts world figures.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"but let me emphasise that whether in culture, politics, the mass media, public life, or in debates on economic issues, no one can ban freedom of thought and the freedom to openly express one’s position.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"let me say again that when we speak of solidarity and unity, what we mean is conscious and natural consolidation of our people in the interests of russia’s successful development.",PAFA
Russia,2016,is it possible to achieve major strategic goals in a fragmented society?,PAFA
Russia,2016,is it possible to resolve our tasks with a parliament that instead of productive work spends its time on competing ambitions and fruitless argument?,PAFA
Russia,2016,can we develop successfully on the shaky foundation of a weak state and apathetic government controlled from abroad and that no longer has the people’s trust?,PAFA
Russia,2016,the answer is clearly no.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"in recent years, we have seen a number of countries where this kind of situation has opened the road to adventurists, coups, and ultimately, anarchy.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"everywhere, the result is the same: human tragedies and victims, degradation and ruin, and disappointment.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"it is worrying to see that around the world, even in the seemingly most prosperous countries and stable regions, we witness the emergence of an ever greater number of new divisions and conflicts on political, ethnic, religious and social lines.",PAFA
Russia,2016,this is all unfolding against the background of the very serious migration crisis that countries in europe and elsewhere face today.,PAFA
Russia,2016,we know well the consequences that these great upheavals can bring.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"unfortunately, our country went through many such upheavals and their consequences in the 20th century.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"next year, 2017, will mark the 100th anniversary of the february and october revolutions.",PAFA
Russia,2016,this is a good moment for looking back on the causes and nature of these revolutions in russia.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"not just historians and scholars should do this; russian society in general needs an objective, honest and deep-reaching analysis of these events.",PAFA
Russia,2016,this is our common history and we need to treat it with respect.,PAFA
Russia,2016,this is something that the outstanding russian and soviet philosopher alexei losev wrote about.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"“we know the thorny road our country has travelled,” he wrote.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"“we know the long and tiring years of struggle, want and suffering, but for our homeland’s sons, this is all their native, inalienable heritage.”",PAFA
Russia,2016,"i am sure that the vast majority of our people have precisely this attitude towards their homeland, and we need history’s lessons primarily for reconciliation and for strengthening the social, political and civil concord that we have managed to achieve.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"it is unacceptable to drag the grudges, anger and bitterness of the past into our life today, and in pursuit of one’s own political and other interests to speculate on tragedies that concerned practically every family in russia, no matter what side of the barricades our forebears were on.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"let’s remember that we are a single people, a united people, and we have only one russia.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"colleagues, the basis of our entire policy is to take care of people and increase human capital as russia’s most important resource.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"therefore, our efforts are aimed at supporting the traditional values and the family, at [implementing] demographic programmes, improving the environment and people’s health, and promoting education and culture.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"you know, i cannot but say a few words about what is happening in reality, about what we have here and what we have achieved.",PAFA
Russia,2016,the natural population growth continues.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"in 2013 – the demographers have the term fertility rate – it was 1.7 in russia, which is higher than in the majority of european countries.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"for example, it is 1.2 in portugal, 1.3 in spain and greece, 1.4 in austria, germany and italy, and 1.5 in the czech republic.",PAFA
Russia,2016,these are 2013 figures.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"in 2015, the total fertility rate will be even higher in russia – 1.78 – the rise is slight but it is still a rise.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"we will continue to introduce changes in the social sphere so that the system meets more of people’s expectations and needs, and becomes more modern and just.",PAFA
Russia,2016,the social spheres should attract skilled professionals and talented young people.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"that is why, we are raising specialists’ salaries and improving their working conditions.let me note that competition to enrol in medical and teacher training universities grows steadily (whereas not so long ago it was hovering around zero).",PAFA
Russia,2016,"in 2016, it was 7.8 persons for the teaching professions, and after the 2016 enrolment the general competition for state-financed openings was almost 28 applications per opening.",PAFA
Russia,2016,god grant all of them – the young specialists – good health and success in their future pursuits.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"i remember well how my colleagues and i discussed hi-tech medical aid projects and networks of perinatal centres, which we lacked at that time.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"in 2018, russia will have 94 such centres.",PAFA
Russia,2016,today our doctors save newborns in the most complicated cases.,PAFA
Russia,2016,we have reached the level of the advanced countries in these indicators as well.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"back in 2015, russia’s infant mortality indicators were 6.5 per 1,000 live births, whereas the european region of the world health organisation had 6.6; this means that our [indicator] was slightly better.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"after 10 months in 2016, russia reached the level of 5.9.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"over the past decade, the number of high-tech medical services has increased by a factor of 15.",PAFA
Russia,2016,hundreds of thousands of complex operations are performed not only at the leading federal centres but also at regional hospitals.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"while in 2005, when we launched the programme, 60,000 people in russia received high-tech medical assistance, in 2016 the number will be 900,000.",PAFA
Russia,2016,it is also essential to move forward.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"still, compare: 60,000 and 900,000.",PAFA
Russia,2016,some difference.,PAFA
Russia,2016,next year we will need to introduce mechanisms to ensure stable financing of high-tech assistance.,PAFA
Russia,2016,this will make it possible to make it even more accessible and reduce waiting time for operations.,PAFA
Russia,2016,on the whole – to put it bluntly – problems in the healthcare sector remain and there are still plenty of them.,PAFA
Russia,2016,they are related mostly to the primary care level.,PAFA
Russia,2016,its development should be given priority.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"patients are often confronted with waiting lines, a perfunctory attitude and indifference.",PAFA
Russia,2016,doctors are overworked and it is difficult to get an appointment with the required specialist.,PAFA
Russia,2016,what often happens is that outpatient clinics are provided with the most modern equipment but medical specialists simply lack qualifications to use that equipment.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"starting next year, regular retraining programmes will be organised at federal and regional medical centres and universities.",PAFA
Russia,2016,a specialist will now obtain an advanced training voucher and will be able to choose where to undergo training.,PAFA
Russia,2016,we will also continue to enhance the it level of the public healthcare system to facilitate the procedure of scheduling doctor’s appointments and keeping records.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"it is important to free doctors from routine tasks, from the need to fill in bundles of reports and statements and give them more time for attending to patients.",PAFA
Russia,2016,information technology will also be used to significantly tighten oversight over the market of vital medications.,PAFA
Russia,2016,this will make it possible to get rid of counterfeit and illegal products and deal with inflated prices in the procurement of medications for hospitals and outpatient clinics.,PAFA
Russia,2016,i propose connecting all of our country’s hospitals and outpatient clinics to high-speed internet over the next two years.,PAFA
Russia,2016,this will enable doctors even in a remote town or village to use the advantages of telemedicine and quickly receive consultations from their colleagues at regional or federal clinics.,PAFA
Russia,2016,i would like to bring this to the attention of the communications and mass media ministry.,PAFA
Russia,2016,the minister has assured me that this task is absolutely realistic and feasible.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"i just mentioned this in my address, and the whole country will now follow the issue carefully.considering russia’s geography, its vast expanses and certain poorly accessible areas, russia needs a well-equipped air ambulance service.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"next year, the air ambulance programme will cover 34 of the country’s regions, which will receive funding from the federal budget.first of all, i am referring to siberia, the north and the far east.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"for this purpose (the parliament members should know this, as it was partly their initiative), in 2017, we will allocate 3.3 billion rubles to pay for aviation services as part of the air ambulance development project (the proposal should be adopted in the second reading).",PAFA
Russia,2016,"colleagues, in every corner of our great country, children have to be able to study in a pleasant, user-friendly, modern environment, so we will continue the programme for the reconstruction and renovation of schools.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"there will be no more rundown and dilapidated school buildings with no basic amenities.it is necessary to finally resolve the problem of the third shift, and hopefully eliminate second shifts as well.",PAFA
Russia,2016,we should certainly make extra effort to improve the qualifications of teachers.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"as you know, a programme is being implemented to expand the number of students served by educational institutions in 2016.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"this programme is planned for 2016−2025, with 25 billion roubles envisaged annually.incidentally, we all know that it is primarily the regions’ responsibility.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"however, we decided to support the regions in this important initiative.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"overall, from 2016 to 2019, we plan to create 187,998 new openings for students in schools.at the same time, the greatest concern for parents and teachers, and the general public as well is the content of the educational process and how well school education meets two basic goals that academician dmitry likhachev listed: to give knowledge and to foster morality.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"he rightly believed that morality is the basis that determines the viability of society: its economic, public, and creative sustainability.it is certainly important to preserve the depth and solidity of national education.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"compositions have been returned to the school curriculum, and more attention is being paid to the humanities.yet, the hours of tuition according to the school curriculum will clearly not be enough here.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"we need projects in the theatre, cinema, television and museums, and on the internet, that are of interest to young people, that attract the attention of young people to the national classical literature, culture and history.our schools must promote creativity.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"the children must learn to think independently, work both on their own and as part of a team, address unusual tasks and formulate and achieve goals, which will help them have an interesting and prosperous life.great many experiments have been held in russian schools and abroad.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"we should consider experiments carefully, but we certainly must move forward.",PAFA
Russia,2016,we must promote the culture of research and engineering work.the number of cutting edge science parks for children will increase to 40 within two years.,PAFA
Russia,2016,they will serve as the basis for the development of a network of technical project groups across the country.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"companies, universities and research institutes should contribute to this, so that our children will see clearly that all of them have equal opportunities and an equal start in life, that russia needs their ideas and knowledge and that they can prove their mettle in russian companies and laboratories.we can see the success of the sirius educational centre for gifted children.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"i believe that we need a network of such centres, and i propose that the regional authorities consider creating centres for gifted children at their best universities and schools.at the same time, there are several things i would like to stress.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"our education system must be based on the principle that all children and teenagers are gifted and can succeed in science, in creative areas and sport, in careers and in life.",PAFA
Russia,2016,our task is to help them develop their talents.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"when they are successful, russia is successful too.colleagues, i view the young generation as russia’s reliable foundation in a turbulent and complicated 21st century.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"i believe that they are able not just to rise to challenges but also to make their contribution to the development of the intellectual, technological and cultural agenda of global development.it is not surprising that so many students at schools and universities take part in volunteer projects in such vital areas as patient care, assistance to the seniors and people with disabilities, education, sport, culture, local history, search parties, and the protection of nature and animals.it is a trait of our times that large numbers of people are now ready to contribute to all kinds of charity initiatives, such as petitions on social media and in the media to collect funds for treating the ill or helping children.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"many people are quick to respond to such calls and do so sincerely without seeking to gain any profit.sometimes it is even surprising to see that people who do not make that much money have the urge to help those in need.i ask the civic chamber and the agency for strategic initiatives to become proactive in supporting volunteer organisations, charities and non-profits.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"through their commitment and generosity, people who contribute to such projects promote collective efforts that russia needs so much right now.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"they create significant social potential that must be used effectively.it is necessary to remove all barriers that undermine the development of the volunteer movement, and also provide every assistance non-profit organisations might need.",PAFA
Russia,2016,the key decisions in this respect have already been taken.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"starting next year, non-profits with the required experience will be authorised to provide social services funded from the budget.colleagues, i would now like to call on many of you, and i want to be sure that governors and municipal authorities hear what i say.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"i ask you not to be, as they say, greedy, to refrain from working only with state-run institutions, and enable non-profit organisations to provide social services as much as possible.",PAFA
Russia,2016,it is very important to establish cordial relations with people.,PAFA
Russia,2016,i propose that we all keep an eye on these issues.what we all want is to improve the quality of social services by engaging non-profits in this sphere.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"i instruct the government and the parliament to finalise efforts to devise a clear legal framework for non-profit organisations as providers of socially important services and establish requirements in terms of their competence, without creating additional red tape, of course.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"we must value the people’s demanding, engaged and proactive attitude in this respect.i would like to once again address many of you with the appeal to not hide in your offices and not fear dialogue with the people, but go to meet them, speak with them honestly and openly, and support their initiatives.",PAFA
Russia,2016,this is particularly important on urban development issues and matters concerning preserving the historical appearance and creating a modern living environment.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"unfortunately, such issues are sometimes decided in the corridors, and when this happens, it is hard not to ask, “are you sure that what you are proposing, based only on the opinions heard in officials’ offices, is the best proposal?",PAFA
Russia,2016,"is it not better to consult with the people and ask them what they want to see in their streets, yards, parks and embankments, sports fields and children’s playgrounds?”",PAFA
Russia,2016,"next year, we will send 20 billion rubles for urban development programmes to the regions, including in the single industry towns.",PAFA
Russia,2016,it is a matter of principle that residents should take part in deciding how this money should be spent and which projects should take priority.,PAFA
Russia,2016,i ask the russian popular front to take an active part in this work too.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"we need to organise effective oversight of this work so as to ensure the concrete results that people want to see, and we must support people who wish to join in these urban development projects.it is important that civil society takes an active part in deciding issues such as improving environmental protection legislation, protecting rare plant and animal species, and establishing a humane system for dealing with stray animals.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"we have declared next year, 2017, the year of the environment.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"i am instructing the government to draft programmes for protecting such unique symbols of russia’s nature as the volga, lake baikal, and lake teletskoye in altai.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"throughout the country, we need to clean up polluted areas and clear the dumps that have grown up on the outskirts of many towns, as we heard recently from russian popular front activists.",PAFA
Russia,2016,this problem exists not just in big towns but also in small settlements.moscow and st petersburg are already carrying out large-scale road modernisation programmes.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"starting next year, we will begin similar projects in other big cities too, in urban areas that are home to around 40 million people.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"over the next two years, at least half of the roads should be modernised.",PAFA
Russia,2016,i will not go further into the details now.,PAFA
Russia,2016,the decision has been taken and the needed funds earmarked.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"now, we just need to work effectively.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"we will also pay the needed attention to important federal roads and to building the bridge to crimea, which is an infrastructure project of national importance.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"this bridge’s construction is going to schedule.colleagues, two years ago, we encountered serious economic challenges and a difficult situation on global markets.",PAFA
Russia,2016,we found ourselves facing sanctions that were an attempt to get us to dance to another’s tune and ignore our own fundamental national interests.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"but let me say again that the main reasons for our economic slowdown are to be found above all in our internal problems, and above all in the lack of investment resources, modern technology, professional human resources, insufficient competition, and shortcomings in our business climate.",PAFA
Russia,2016,the real sector of the economy has stopped falling now and we have seen a small increase in industrial production.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"last year, our gdp fell by around 3.7 percent, but i think that this year, the figure will be small.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"over the first 10 months of 2016, it came to 0.3 percent, and i think the final figure will be close to this.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"the support programmes for a number of industrial sectors, including the housing market, have played a big part.",PAFA
Russia,2016,i will say more about this now.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"we see the increase in industrial production, and it is small, but the trend is a positive one and we should certainly work now to keep it going.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"concerning the housing market, more than 85 million square metres of housing came onto the market in 2015.",PAFA
Russia,2016,this was a historic record for our country.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"this housing must be sold now, and of course, we need to increase people’s purchasing power.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"i will say more about this too, in relation to our mortgage support programmes.",PAFA
Russia,2016,we shall continue to provide targeted assistance to economic sectors still facing a negative situation.,PAFA
Russia,2016,i already mentioned that modest growth in industrial production is underway now.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"we have seen a slight overall decline in the automotive industry, although trucks have shown an increase of 14.7 percent, light commercial vehicles, up 2.9 percent, and buses, up 35.1 percent.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"in railway engineering, there is a 21.8 percent growth, and freight cars are up 26 percent.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"agricultural machinery and equipment have shown very good momentum, 26.8 percent.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"the light industry is also demonstrating an upward trend.we have ensured macroeconomic stability, which is very important, and have maintained financial reserves.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"the central bank gold and currency reserves have not decreased, but have even grown.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"whereas on january 1, 2016 they totalled $368.39 billion, now they stand at $389.4, almost 400 billion.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"here, too, we can see positive dynamics.we expect a significant decrease in inflation by the end of this year, to below 6 percent.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"here, too, i would like to cite a few figures.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"if you remember, the inflation rate in 2015 was 12.9 percent.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"i hope that it will not rise above 6 percent this year, will stop around 5.8 percent.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"obviously good, positive dynamics.allow me to remind you that the lowest inflation rate was recorded in 2011, 6.1 percent.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"i will repeat, this year it might be even lower.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"this means that next year, we could really achieve the target of 4 percent.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"this is a very good prerequisite for achieving substantial growth relying on a healthy economy.however, i would like to emphasise that stabilisation does not mean an automatic transition to a sustainable recovery.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"if we do not address the underlying problems of the russian economy, if we do not launch new growth factors at their full force, it will stagnate for years, and we will have to constantly scrimp and save, to delay development.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"we cannot afford that.we will follow another path, which requires a clear statement of objectives and phased, system-based work towards achieving these objectives.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"this approach has yielded significant positive results more than once, and in a fairly short period of time.",PAFA
Russia,2016,there was a time when we thought our agriculture issues would exist forever.,PAFA
Russia,2016,we know what was said about this and how it offended our farmers when we spoke about agriculture as a kind of black hole that can swallow any amount of money and still produce no results.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"no, it turned out, even that sector could be rearranged.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"we found weighted solutions, adopted a state programme, created a flexible system of support for agricultural producers and agribusinesses, and today farming is a successful industry that feeds the country and is gaining international markets.but as the proverb goes, every cloud has a silver lining.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"our partners imposed the sanctions i mentioned, and we took measures in response and at the same time ended up helping our agricultural producers on the domestic market.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"they should remember though that this cannot and probably will not continue forever, and in any case, consumers need a competitive market environment.",PAFA
Russia,2016,our producers should therefore make the most of the current favourable situation.agricultural produce exports bring in more revenue today than arms exports.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"only recently, we would probably have scarcely imagined such a thing possible.",PAFA
Russia,2016,i have already spoken publicly about this and can say it again here today.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"incidentally, as far as our arms exports go, we are still a serious contender on this market.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"our exports came to $14.5 billion in 2015, and our agricultural produce exports came to $16.2 billion.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"this year, we expect a figure of $16.9 billion, which is very good.",PAFA
Russia,2016,let’s thank our agriculture sector workers for this result.,PAFA
Russia,2016,much depends on the regions when it comes to developing the agriculture sector.,PAFA
Russia,2016,i think we should give them greater independence in setting the priorities for using federal subsidies for the agriculture sector.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"the volume of subsidies should be pegged to increases in cultivated land, yields, and other quantitative indicators of effective production.",PAFA
Russia,2016,this would encourage producers to bring idle agricultural land under cultivation and start using advanced agricultural technology.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"here, i want to stress that if we give the regions more independence in using federal budget money and federal support, this places greater responsibility on them for producing results, effectively investing the resources received, strengthening their own economic base, resolving social problems and problems in the housing and utilities sector.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"in order to give our farmers greater opportunities for finding markets, we need to pay greater attention to supporting agricultural cooperatives.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"i ask the agricultural ministry, rosselkhozbank and rosagroleasing to work on this matter, as well as the corporation for small and medium business development that will receive a capital injection of 13 billion rubles next year.",PAFA
Russia,2016,we have carried out far-reaching modernisation at our defence industry enterprises.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"this has resulted in increased production and, particularly important, in a significant increase in labour productivity.",PAFA
Russia,2016,the defence industry has posted very good results and gives a good example.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"in 2016, we expect growth in the defence industry to reach 10.1 percent, and a labour productivity increase of 9.8 percent.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"we must direct the defence industry to produce up-to-date competitive civilian products for healthcare, energy, aviation and shipbuilding, space exploration and other high-tech industries.",PAFA
Russia,2016,the share of civilian products must increase to at least one-third of the defence industry’s total output within the next 10 years.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"we have recently held a meeting on this issue, or rather several meetings, and i want to share our plans with you.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"in 2016, civilian goods will reach 16.1 percent of the defence industry’s output, and we plan to slightly increase this percentage by 2020.",PAFA
Russia,2016,the increase will be relatively small because the defence ministry has placed many rearmament contracts with the industry.,PAFA
Russia,2016,the share of civilian goods will reach 30 percent in 2025 and at least 50 percent in 2030.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"i instruct the government to organise systemic work to achieve these goals with support from our development institutions, including vnesheconombank (veb), the russian export centre and the industry development fund.the it industry is one of the most rapidly developing sectors, which is heartening.",PAFA
Russia,2016,russian it companies have doubled their exports over the past five years.,PAFA
Russia,2016,i have just cited the figures for the defence industry and agriculture: the figure for the defence industry is $14.5 billion.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"our it exports were almost zero only recently, but they have risen to $7 billion now.the it industry has also improved other performance indicators, such as revenue and tax payments, in part due to reduced insurance payment.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"the finance ministry has not recommended me to say that all these achievements were due to incentives, and so i am telling you that we also used other support instruments, although it should be admitted that incentives are very important for supporting our it companies.",PAFA
Russia,2016,this instrument has allowed them to effectively use their innovative intellectual potential.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"at the beginning of their development in 2010, the it companies’ tax payments amounted to slightly over 28 billion rubles, while two years later the figure reached 54 billion rubles.",PAFA
Russia,2016,you can judge the growth for yourself.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"considering the incentives, the national shortfall in revenue was only 16 billion rubles.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"in other words, even the federal budget benefited from the it companies’ growth.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"to maintain this positive trend, i propose that we extend these incentives to 2023.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"i am confident that the it industry can become one of our key export sectors within 10 years.on the whole, we have good potential for increasing non-commodity exports.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"at the same time we see protectionism growing in the world and, unfortunately, trade barriers being raised.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"i can tell you that i recently had a meeting with my colleagues in lima, peru and we discussed world trade issues.",PAFA
Russia,2016,one of the main problems is growing protectionism.,PAFA
Russia,2016,but what does this mean for us?,PAFA
Russia,2016,it means that we should fight for access to external markets more actively and decisively.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"intense international competition will temper and strengthen our economy and ensure russian companies reach a new level of efficiency, the quality of goods and services and labour productivity.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"the examples i cited earlier show that we are already changing the economic structure in a focused way, modernising corresponding sectors and creating new ones, and establishing modern companies that can work on international markets.",PAFA
Russia,2016,it is essential to continue moving in this direction systematically and assertively.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"what is needed are not abstract scenarios, which are mostly irrelevant, but a professional, thoroughly calculated development forecast.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"it is important to define clearly how a better business climate, major investment projects, an expansion of non-commodity exports, and support for small and medium-sized businesses will contribute to economic growth and what the role of regions and particular production sectors will be.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"i direct the government, together with the leading business associations, no later than may 2017, to develop a detailed plan of action through 2025, the implementation of which will make it possible to achieve economic growth rates higher than in the [rest of the] world as early as 2019−2020, and therefore strengthen russia’s positions in the global economy.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"ladies and gentlemen, to reiterate, it is important that this plan be supported and trusted by the business community so that entrepreneurs become actively involved in its implementation.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"today, there is obviously a growing demand in society for an expansion of economic freedoms (we have talked about that more than once), stable, steady and predictable rules of doing business, including the tax system.",PAFA
Russia,2016,it may be recalled that in 2014 we took the decision not to change the existing tax requirements for business over the next four years.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"we did not review them despite the changes in the economic situation and that, without a doubt, has had a positive impact on companies’ performance.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"at the same time, we should steer our tax system to work toward the main objective: to stimulate business activity, ensure economic growth and investment, and create a competitive environment for the development of our companies.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"it is necessary to streamline the existing fiscal benefits, making them more targeted, and abandon ineffective instruments.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"i suggest that within the next year we carry out a detailed and comprehensive review of proposals to fine-tune the taxation system, and we should by all means involve business associations in this effort.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"despite the domestic political timetable, we still need to draft and adopt in 2018 all relevant amendments to laws and the tax code so that they can come into force on january 1, 2019, setting new, stable long-term rules.at the same time, i am asking the government to explore ways to improve mechanisms that guarantee stability of the budget and public finances, while delivering on all our commitments regardless of external factors, including the price of oil and gas.moving on, we have overhauled the legal framework that regulates business activity.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"at the current stage, it is important to ensure that the adopted provisions are enforced, especially in the regions.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"let me draw your attention to the fact that in every region of the country the basic services provided to businesses, such as construction permits, infrastructure access and so on and so forth, should be consistent with the requirements as per the federal laws and the best regional practices.colleagues, we discussed this issue during a recent meeting held, i believe, in yaroslavl.",PAFA
Russia,2016,this issue cannot be treated superficially.,PAFA
Russia,2016,this is an extremely important area for our joint work.,PAFA
Russia,2016,we will monitor developments in the regions very closely and evaluate the performance of regional authorities using these indicators.,PAFA
Russia,2016,this is a major task that has to be achieved as early as next year.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"by doing so, we will make sure that all russian regions operate within a single business environment and all provide quality services to the business community.for many years now, we have been discussing the issue of streamlining the activities of supervision and regulatory bodies.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"beginning next year, they will become much more transparent by releasing to the public data on who inspects whom, how frequently, and what are the results achieved.this will provide an opportunity to promptly respond to abuses and every violation of entrepreneurs’ rights by an inspector.",PAFA
Russia,2016,i will not go through the list of all the decisions that were adopted to this effect.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"there are quite a few of them, so all we need is to make sure that they are implemented.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"we must do away with instructions that have nothing to do with the quality of services or security, while creating unsurmountable barriers for businesses.let me draw to the government’s attention that the regulatory and supervisory bodies should speed up their work to introduce a risk evaluation-based approach that makes it possible to reduce substantially the number of inspections while making them more effective.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"i add that the inspection bodies should concern themselves not just with identifying violations, but also with prevention, and not just through formal measures, but in substance and, particularly important, provide consultative assistance to entrepreneurs, especially to those who are just starting their business.",PAFA
Russia,2016,i have already given the direct instruction to make sure that self-employed people’s work is not considered unlawful business activity.,PAFA
Russia,2016,we should not start creating problems for these people for invented pretexts.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"in order to exclude the possibility of this kind of situation arising, i ask you within the coming year to formulate a clear legal status for self-employed people and give them the chance to work in calm and regular fashion.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"every person engaged in honest business, whether self-employed or as hired labour, should know that the state authorities and society are on their side.",PAFA
Russia,2016,justice is not about putting everyone in exactly the same conditions.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"it means giving people greater freedom, creating conditions for pursuing activity that brings respect, prosperity and success.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"everything that limits these opportunities and violates people’s rights is unjust.in last year’s address, i spoke about pressure on business from some people in the law enforcement agencies.",PAFA
Russia,2016,this sort of action often leads to successful businesses collapsing and people having their assets taken from them.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"i want to thank the deputies for supporting the draft law that considerably toughens criminal penalties against law enforcement personnel for fabricating cases, including with the aim of hindering the work of businesspeople.i want to say a few words about the fight against corruption.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"over recent years, we have seen a fair number of headline-making cases against officials at the local, regional and federal levels.",PAFA
Russia,2016,i stress that the vast majority of civil servants are honest and decent people who work for the good of our country.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"but neither one’s office, nor connections in high places or past services can serve as a shield for corrupt officials.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"at the same time, and i want to stress this point, no one has the right to pronounce a person’s guilt or innocence before the court has delivered its verdict.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"unfortunately, it has become common practice here to raise a fuss in the media over these headline-grabbing cases.",PAFA
Russia,2016,we see that people from the law enforcement agencies are often also guilty of this.,PAFA
Russia,2016,i want to stress the point that the fight against corruption is not a show.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"it requires professionalism, and a serious and responsible approach.",PAFA
Russia,2016,only then will it produce results and receive society’s broad support.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"colleagues, it is obvious that the external constraints and domestic borrowing rate increase have reduced the availability of financial resources for businesses and individuals.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"nevertheless, the banking system has been able to replace foreign loans to our companies and stabilise the situation, and this is an obvious fact.now we need to reinforce business activity, the implementation of major economic projects, the available funding, especially since inflation is going down as i already said – this creates objective conditions for making bank loans cheaper.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"i repeat, the situation has improved slightly, but only for individual sectors.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"overall, lending to the economy is still showing unstable dynamics.we injected 827 billion rubles into the banking system as part of the 2015−2016 anti-crisis support programme.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"according to estimates, this resource allowed banks to significantly increase lending to the non-financial sectors.however, the volume of these loans has not grown this year, but even went down slightly.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"i know about the calculations in rubles and in foreign currency, but the decline is still there, even taking into account the exchange rate difference.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"i would like those experts who believe the exchange rate differences are important to take note of this.indeed, it is clear that the ruble rate has changed against the dollar and the euro, and this must be taken into account, but even with this in mind, all the same, the decline in lending is evident.there is certainly no doubt that we need to stimulate lending to the real sector.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"but the key question remains, what methods and means should we use to do so?",PAFA
Russia,2016,"obviously, only stable banks with a solid capital reserve are in a position to develop lending.this year, russian banks have regained their profitability.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"the sector’s profit for the 10 months of last year was 193 billion rubles, and rose almost four-fold, to 714 billion rubles for the same period this year.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"furthermore, thanks to the central bank’s consistent and decisive efforts, the banking system is being cleared of outfits that break the law, violate clients’ rights, and carry out dubious financial operations.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"many of them, at least the weak players, have left the market.",PAFA
Russia,2016,the central bank has made an effort to clean up the banking system and continues this work now.,PAFA
Russia,2016,this forms a good foundation for rapid pick-up in the economy and for developing lending to the real sector.,PAFA
Russia,2016,a number of countries have offered banks incentives to stimulate lending to the real sector of the economy.,PAFA
Russia,2016,some countries are also discussing the possibility of setting limits on how much borrowed funds banks can place in financial instruments.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"i am not saying that we should copy blindly everything that is done abroad, all the more so as the russian economy and its structure differ considerably from other countries that are taking these measures, but we can and should analyse these practices and borrow what would be suitable here.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"in many countries, a non-banking financial sector works with success.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"we should develop this sector here too, as this would enable us to bring more money from investors and citizens into the economy through bonds and other mechanisms.",PAFA
Russia,2016,this is something we have been discussing for quite some time now.,PAFA
Russia,2016,i hope that the central bank and the government will draft proposals on developing the financial market.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"of course, this work should focus on our economic growth tasks and any changes made should not lead to the emergence of macroeconomic imbalances or to bubbles in the economy.",PAFA
Russia,2016,it is very important to support lending for small businesses.,PAFA
Russia,2016,this lending continues to fall for now.,PAFA
Russia,2016,what additional steps should we take to change this?,PAFA
Russia,2016,the financial authorities think that this situation can be remedied.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"big banks, for reasons of the scale and complexity of their operations, apply strict requirements in accordance with international standards (some experts think that these standards are overly strict for our situation, but let’s not go into the details of this debate now), but small regional banks that carry out the vital function of lending to small businesses and the general public usually have simpler banking operations and so could work according to simplified regulations and requirements.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"these banks account for only 1.5 percent of total banking assets, and so this would not create any risks for the banking system as a whole.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"this kind of differentiated banking system regulation would enable clients to go to the bank that best suits their needs, and small businesses would not have to compete with big companies for credit resources.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"of course, our fundamental requirement has not changed: each level of the banking system must be healthy and stable, so that the clients and investors will be confident of the safety of their funds.colleagues, to move up to a higher development level in the economy and social sector we need our own advanced research and scientific solutions.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"we must focus on the sectors where a powerful technological potential is accumulating for the future, that is, digital and other cross-cutting technologies that now determine all spheres of life.",PAFA
Russia,2016,the countries that generate such technologies will get a lasting advantage and an opportunity to generate huge technological revenues.,PAFA
Russia,2016,those who fail to do this will be placed in a dependent and disadvantaged position.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"cross-cutting technologies are technologies that can be applied in all sectors, such as digital, quantum, robotic, neural and other technologies.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"however, we should be wary of the inherent risks of the digital technology.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"we must strengthen our protection against cyber threats and greatly enhance the stability of all infrastructure elements, the financial system and state governance.i propose launching a large-scale system-wide programme to develop an economy of a new technological generation, the so-called digital economy.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"we will rely on russian companies and russian scientific, research and engineering centres to implement this programme.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"russia’s national and technological independence, in fact, our future depend on this.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"we need to conduct an inventory to remove managerial, legal and any other barriers that hinder the advance of our business to existing and emerging high-tech markets.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"we must allocate sufficient financial resources for these projects, including by setting this task to the refurbished veb (bank for development).",PAFA
Russia,2016,"we will need skilled personnel, engineers and workers, who will be ready to fulfil next-generation tasks.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"this is why we are cooperating with businesses to create an up-to-date system of secondary vocational education and college and vocational school teacher training based on advanced international standards.we will increase the percentage of state-financed students at engineering, it and other key departments on which our economic development depends.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"next year, our leading universities, including in the regions, will establish competence centres, which will provide intellectual and personnel support to projects that are connected with the emergence of new sectors and markets.fundamental research is a powerful factor in accumulating scientific and technological expertise required for economic growth and social development.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"it faces a dual task: to assess and predict future trends and offer the best solutions to the emerging challenges.in science, just as in every other sector, we will promote competition and support the strongest, those who are able to produce practical results.",PAFA
Russia,2016,the russian academy of sciences and all research organisations should take this into account.,PAFA
Russia,2016,we will continue building the research infrastructure that will allow us to perform large-scale scientific tasks.over 200 laboratories have already been established under the mega grants programme.,PAFA
Russia,2016,it would be no exaggeration to say that they are operating on a global level.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"they are led by scientists who determine the trends of global scientific development (incidentally, many of them are our compatriots who went abroad in the past).",PAFA
Russia,2016,recently i met with a group of such researchers.,PAFA
Russia,2016,now many of them are spending most of their time in russian laboratories.,PAFA
Russia,2016,they are successful and enjoy their work.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"they can see for themselves that russia is setting interesting scientific tasks, and creating a sound research base and decent working conditions.but, of course, people have the right to understand that there is a horizon of work and planning and in this context i would ask you to ensure long-term funding for productive research projects, in particular, using the resources of the russian science foundation.it is very important to support russia’s talented young scientists and there are many of them.",PAFA
Russia,2016,they should have an opportunity to establish their research teams and laboratories.,PAFA
Russia,2016,a special category of seven-year grants will be launched for this purpose.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"another 3.5 billion roubles will be allocated for these purposes, as well as the development of the research infrastructure and the opening of new laboratories in 2017 alone, in addition to the already announced budget for science.needless to say, the activities of research centres should be closely integrated with the education system, the economy and high-tech companies.",PAFA
Russia,2016,we must turn our research projects into successful commercial products.,PAFA
Russia,2016,this has always been a weak spot for us.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"a lot of time passes from developments to their introduction and sometimes even… this applies not only to our time, and not even to the soviet time.",PAFA
Russia,2016,things were the same in the russian empire.,PAFA
Russia,2016,we must overcome this trend and we can do this.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"to resolve this issue, we launched the national technology initiative two years ago.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"it is called upon to ensure the leading positions for russian companies and products in the most promising markets of the future.colleagues, all of what i said now, all of these priorities are set out in the national science and technology development strategy.",PAFA
Russia,2016,i have signed the executive order approving it.you all know that we have encountered attempts to pressure us from abroad over these last years.,PAFA
Russia,2016,i mentioned this twice.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"they have used every means: from spreading myths about russian aggression, propaganda and meddling in others’ elections to persecuting our athletes, including our paralympic athletes.but, as i said, every cloud has a silver lining, and the doping scandal, i am sure, will help us to put in place the most advanced system here in russia for fighting this scourge.",PAFA
Russia,2016,i say this based on the fact that our national doping prevention programme will be ready at the start of next year.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"what i want to say is that everyone has more than had their fill now of media campaigns carried out to order, the fabrication and publication of compromising material, and moralising lectures.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"if need be, we can lecture whoever, but we understand our responsibility and we have a sincere desire to take part in resolving global and regional problems, in situations, of course, where our involvement is fitting, wanted and needed.",PAFA
Russia,2016,we do not want confrontation with anyone.,PAFA
Russia,2016,we have no need for it and neither do our partners or the global community.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"unlike some of our colleagues abroad, who consider russia an adversary, we do not seek and never have sought enemies.",PAFA
Russia,2016,we need friends.,PAFA
Russia,2016,but we will not allow our interests to be infringed upon or ignored.,PAFA
Russia,2016,we want to and will decide our destiny ourselves and build our present and future without others’ unasked for advice and prompting.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"at the same time, we desire well-intentioned and equal dialogue and we affirm the principles of justice and mutual respect in international affairs.",PAFA
Russia,2016,we are ready for a serious discussion on building a stable system of international relations for the 21st century.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"sadly, the decades that have passed since the end of the cold war have been wasted.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"we support security and development opportunities not just for the select few, but for all countries and peoples, and we support respect for international law and global diversity.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"we oppose any monopoly, whether it be a claim to exceptionality or attempts to bend the international trade rules to suit one’s own needs, limit freedom of speech and, in fact, introduce censorship to the global information space.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"we were always reproached for supposedly imposing censorship here in russia, but now we see that others are taking this road themselves.russia is proactive in promoting a positive agenda in international organisations and informal associations, including the un, the group of twenty and apec.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"together with our partners we also promote our own frameworks, such as the csto, brics and the sco.",PAFA
Russia,2016,further strengthening cooperation within the eurasian economic union and with other cis countries has always been a foreign policy priority for russia.russia attaches great importance to the idea of building a multi-level integration model for eurasia in the form of a greater eurasian partnership.,PAFA
Russia,2016,we are already discussing this idea on various international and regional levels.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"i am confident that we can have conversation with the european union countries, where the demand for political and economic independence is currently on the rise.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"this is what we see judging by election results.there is great potential for russia in terms of cooperation with the asia-pacific region, as we saw at this year’s eastern economic forum.",PAFA
Russia,2016,i ask the government to make sure that all decisions regarding the development of the russian far east are implemented without exception.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"let me reiterate that russia is proactive in its eastern policy not because of any momentary considerations we may have, not because of the cooling in relations with the united states or the european union, but for the reason that it serves russia’s long-term interests and is consistent with the global development trends.in today’s challenging environment, the comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation between russia and china have become one of the key factors in ensuring global and regional stability.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"this partnership can be regarded as a model for shaping a world order free from the domination of a single country, no matter how strong it is, and taking into account the interests of all countries in harmony.today, china is about to become the world’s largest economy, so it is very important that every year adds new large-scale projects in various areas, including trade, investment, energy and high technology, to our mutually beneficial cooperation.developing a special privileged strategic partnership with india is another major foreign policy priority for russia.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"in october 2016, goa hosted russian-indian top-level talks, confirming that our countries have great potential for strengthening cooperation in a number of areas.russia also expects to achieve substantial progress in relations with japan, our eastern neighbour.",PAFA
Russia,2016,we welcome the commitment of the country’s leaders to promote economic ties with russia by launching joint projects and programmes.russia is also ready to work with the new us administration.,PAFA
Russia,2016,it is important to put bilateral relations back on track and to develop them on an equal and mutually beneficial basis.cooperation between russia and the united states in addressing global and regional issues will benefit the whole world.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"we have a shared responsibility to ensure international security and stability, to strengthen non-proliferation regimes.i would like to emphasise that attempts to break the strategic parity are extremely dangerous and can lead to a global catastrophe.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"we must not forget about it even for a second.i certainly count on joining efforts with the united states in the fight against real rather than fictional threats, international terrorism being one of them.",PAFA
Russia,2016,that is the task our servicemen are fulfilling in syria.,PAFA
Russia,2016,terrorists have suffered significant losses.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"the russian army and navy have shown convincingly that they are capable of operating effectively away from their permanent deployment sites.by the way, we also appreciate the work that special services and divisions are carrying out inside the country to combat terrorism.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"we have suffered casualties, too.",PAFA
Russia,2016,all of that is certainly in the focus of our attention.,PAFA
Russia,2016,we will continue this work.,PAFA
Russia,2016,"i want to thank all of our military for their professionalism and dignity, their courage and bravery, for the fact that you, russian soldiers, cherish your own and your country’s honour.colleagues,when people feel they are doing the right thing, they act in close solidarity, and advance with confidence along the chosen path.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"in recent years, we have had a hard time, but these trials have made us even stronger, truly stronger, helped us better and more clearly define those areas in which our efforts must be even more persistent and vigorous.while overcoming the current difficulties, we have created a foundation for further movement forward.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"we never stopped working on the development agenda, which is extremely important.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"that is, we did not get bogged down in some trivia of the day, like dealing with survival issues, but we thought about the development agenda and contributed to it.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"this agenda is coming to the forefront today.the country’s future depends on us, on all our citizens’ work and talent, on their responsibility and success.",PAFA
Russia,2016,"we will certainly achieve our goals, resolve the challenges of today and tomorrow.thank you very much.(",PAFA
Russia,2016,anthem of the russian federation.),PAFA
Russia,2018,"citizens of russia, members of the federation council and state duma,today’s address is a very special landmark event, just as the times we are living in, when the choices we make and every step we take are set to shape the future of our country for decades to come.it is at such turning points that russia has proven, time and again, its ability to develop and renew itself, discover new territories, build cities, conquer space and make major discoveries.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"this unwavering forward-looking drive, coupled with traditions and values, ensured the continuity in the thousand-year-long history of our nation.we have gone through major challenging transformations, and were able to overcome new and extremely complex economic and social challenges, preserved the unity of our country, built a democratic society and set it on the path to freedom and independence.we ensured sustainability and stability in almost all areas of life, which is critical for a huge and multi-ethnic country like ours with its complex federative structure and diversity of cultures, with historical divides that are still alive in people’s memory and major challenges russia had to face over the course of its history.however, sustainability is the foundation of development but not its guarantee.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"we have no right to allow a situation when the stability that has been achieved would lead to complacency, all the more so as many problems remain unresolved.today, russia ranks among the world’s leading nations with a powerful foreign economic and defence potential.",PAFA
Russia,2018,but we have not yet reached the required level in the context of accomplishing our highly important task and guaranteeing people’s quality of life and prosperity.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"but we must do this, and we will do this.as i said in the past, the state’s role and positions in the modern world are not determined only or predominantly by natural resources or production capacities; the decisive role is played by the people, as well as conditions for every individual’s development, self-assertion and creativity.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"therefore, everything hinges on efforts to preserve the people of russia and to guarantee the prosperity of our citizens we must achieve a decisive breakthrough in this area.i repeat, a solid foundation has been created for this.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"therefore, we can now set and accomplish new tasks.",PAFA
Russia,2018,we already have substantial experience in implementing ambitious programmes and social projects.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"the russian economy has proved its resilience, and the current stable macro-economic situation opens up new opportunities for surging ahead and maintaining long-term growth.finally, the world is now accumulating a tremendous technological potential making it possible to achieve a real breakthrough in improving the people’s quality of life and modernising the economy, the infrastructure and state governance and administration.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"how effectively we will able to use the colossal potentialities of the technological revolution, and how we will respond to its challenges depends on us alone.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"in this sense, the next few years will prove decisive for the country’s future.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"i reiterate, these years will be decisive.i will tell you why.",PAFA
Russia,2018,what i will say now has no connection to the domestic political cycle or even the presidential election.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"no matter who is elected president, each russian citizen and all of us together must be able to see what is going on in the world, what is happening around us, and what challenges we are facing.the speed of technological progress is accelerating sharply.",PAFA
Russia,2018,it is rising dramatically.,PAFA
Russia,2018,those who manage to ride this technological wave will surge far ahead.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"those who fail to do this will be submerged and drown in this wave.technological lag and dependence translate into reduced security and economic opportunities of the country and, ultimately, the loss of its sovereignty.",PAFA
Russia,2018,this is the way things stand now.,PAFA
Russia,2018,the lag inevitably weakens and erodes the human potential.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"because new jobs, modern companies and an attractive life will develop in other, more successful countries where educated and talented young people will go, thereby draining the society’s vital powers and development energy.as i have said, changes concern the entire civilization, and the sheer scale of these changes calls for an equally powerful response.",PAFA
Russia,2018,we are ready to provide it.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"we are ready for a genuine breakthrough.my confidence is based on the results we have achieved together, even though they may seem modest at first glance, as well as on the unity of russian society and, most importantly, on the huge potential of russia and our talented and ingenious people.in order to move forward and to develop dynamically, we must expand freedom in all spheres, strengthen democratic institutions, local governments, civil society institutions and courts, and also open the country to the world and to new ideas and initiatives.it is high time we take a number of tough decisions that are long overdue.",PAFA
Russia,2018,we need to get rid of anything that stands in the way of our development and prevents people from fully unleashing their potential.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"it is our obligation to focus all resources and summon all our strength and willpower in this daring effort that must yield results.otherwise, there will be no future for us, our children or our country.",PAFA
Russia,2018,it is not a question of someone conquering or devastating our land.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"no, that is not the danger.",PAFA
Russia,2018,the main threat and our main enemy is the fact that we are falling behind.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"if we are unable to reverse this trend, we will fall even further behind.",PAFA
Russia,2018,this is like a serious chronic disease that steadily saps the energy from the body and destroys it from within step by step.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"quite often, this destructive process goes unnoticed by the body.we need to master creative power and boost development so that no obstacles prevent us from moving forward with confidence and independently.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"we must take ownership of our destiny.colleagues,what should be our priority?",PAFA
Russia,2018,"let me reiterate that i believe that the main, key development factor is the well-being of the people and the prosperity of russian families.let me remind you that in 2000, 42 million people lived below the poverty line, which amounted to nearly 30 percent – 29 percent of the population.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"in 2012, this indicator fell to 10 percent.poverty has increased slightly against the backdrop of the economic crisis.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"today, 20 million russian nationals live in poverty.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"of course, this is much fewer than the 42 million people in 2000, but it is still way too many.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"there are even working people who have to live very modest lives.for the first time in our recent history, the minimum wage was equated with the subsistence level.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"this provision will come into force on may 1, 2018, and will benefit about 4 million people.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"this is an important step but it still falls short of offering a fundamental solution.we need to upgrade the employment structure that has become inefficient and archaic, provide good jobs that motivate people, improve their well-being and help them uncover their talents.",PAFA
Russia,2018,we need to create decent well-paid jobs.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"this would help deliver on one of the key objectives for the next decade, which is to guarantee sustained long-term real income growth, and to reduce the poverty rate by at least one half over the next six years.it is our moral duty to provide all-round support to members of the older generation, who have made a tremendous contribution to national development.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"senior citizens must have worthy conditions for a long, active and healthy life.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"most importantly, we must raise pensions and index them regularly, so that they outpace inflation.",PAFA
Russia,2018,we will also strive to reduce the gap between the size of pensions and pre-retirement wages.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"and, of course, we must raise the quality of healthcare and social support for senior citizens and help people who are alone and those facing problems in life.we need to address all these issues using a comprehensive approach.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"as i see it, the future new government will have to draft a special programme for the systematic support of senior citizens and for improving their quality of life.we consider every person important and valuable.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"people need to know that they are needed, and they must live a long and healthy life and enjoy their grandchildren and great-grandchildren.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"they need to see their children grow up and become successful in a powerful, rapidly developing and successful country that is attaining new development levels.russia must firmly assert itself among the five largest global economies, and its per-capita gdp must increase by 50 percent by the middle of the next decade.",PAFA
Russia,2018,this is a very difficult task.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"i am confident that we are ready to accomplish it.of course, life expectancy is a highly important fundamental parameter for gauging the well-being of citizens and the country.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"in 2000, russia posted a life expectancy of just over 65 years, with men’s life expectancy falling below 60 years.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"this is not just low, it is a tragedy, and this parameter is tragically inadequate.in the past few years, russia has been posting a major increase in average life expectancy levels, which is among the highest in the world.",PAFA
Russia,2018,we have managed to accomplish this task.,PAFA
Russia,2018,life expectancy levels have increased by over seven years and now total 73 years.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"but, of course, this is not enough either.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"today, we must set an entirely new goal.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"by the end of the next decade, russia must confidently join the club of countries posting a life expectancy of 80-plus years, which includes japan, france and germany.at the same time, life expectancy levels for people living a healthy, active and full life, when they are not hampered and pinned down by illness, must grow faster than planned.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"i am confident that we can achieve this goal, considering the positive trends of the previous years.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"for this purpose, the whole of russia will have to make a quantum leap in its development, so that the life of every person is transformed.colleagues,we need to create a modern living environment and transform cities and villages across the country.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"in doing so, we must make sure that they preserve their identity and historical heritage.",PAFA
Russia,2018,we already have positive experience in renovating the urban environment and infrastructure.,PAFA
Russia,2018,let me elaborate on this point.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"cities like kazan, vladivostok and sochi have already benefited from upgrades of this kind.",PAFA
Russia,2018,change is underway in many regional capitals and smaller cities.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"overall, we now know how to do it.i propose launching a large-scale spatial development programme in russia, which would include developing cities and other communities by at least doubling spending in this area over the next six years.it is obvious that the effort to develop cities and other communities goes hand in hand with the need to overcome challenges in other areas, including healthcare, education, environment and transport.",PAFA
Russia,2018,initiatives in all these segments will require additional funding.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"i will talk about this matter further in my address.urban renovation should be supported by the introduction of state-of-the-art construction technology and materials, modern architectural solutions, digital technology for social services, transport and utilities sectors.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"among other things, this would make the housing and utilities sector more transparent and efficient, so that people receive quality services at a reasonable cost.this large-scale project brings the promise of better economic and social development prospects, a modern living environment, and a favourable climate for cultural and civil initiatives, for small businesses and start-ups.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"all this would facilitate the emergence of a large and creative middle class in russia.of course, a lot will depend on municipal and local authorities and whether they will be receptive to new ideas.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"the ability to respond to the diverse needs of various generations, including families with children, retirees and people with disabilities, will also be instrumental.",PAFA
Russia,2018,people must have a decisive say in the future of their cities and villages.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"we have discussed this many times, including at meetings with heads of municipalities.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"today, i am not saying it just to check the box.",PAFA
Russia,2018,i ask you to bring it to the attention of decision-makers at all levels.it is important that the development of cities becomes the driving force for the whole country.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"russia is a country with a vast territory, and its active, dynamic life cannot be concentrated in several metropolitan cities.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"big cities must distribute their energy, and serve as a support for the balanced, harmonious spatial development of the whole of russia.therefore, there is an urgent need for an appropriate modern infrastructure.",PAFA
Russia,2018,i will return to this later.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"however, it is obvious that developed utilities is what will enable residents of small towns and villages to take advantage of all the opportunities and modern services that are available in big cities, and smaller towns will be closely integrated into russia’s single social and economic space.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"at the same time, we will support initiatives that will help our small towns and villages to preserve their cultural identity, to re-discover their unique potential in a new way.particular attention will be paid to the social and infrastructural development of rural areas.",PAFA
Russia,2018,russian agriculture has already become a globally competitive industry.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"therefore, people who work for this success should live a comfortable and modern life.colleagues,i understand how important it is for everyone, for every family, to have their own house, their own home.",PAFA
Russia,2018,i know this is the problem of problems in russia.,PAFA
Russia,2018,it lingers from decade to decade.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"how many times governments promised and tried, sincerely tried to resolve it.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"but we can and must do it now.in 2017, three million families in russia improved their living conditions.",PAFA
Russia,2018,now we need to reach a stable level (i emphasise this: it is the first time in the history of modern russia) – to a level where at least five million families improve their housing conditions annually.,PAFA
Russia,2018,this is a difficult task – to jump from three million to five.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"we reached 3.1 million last year, but we need to make it five.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"yet, it is an attainable goal.i see three key factors for increasing the affordability of housing.",PAFA
Russia,2018,the first is the growth of people’s incomes.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"i have spoken about this in the past, and we must ensure this.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"next, a decrease in mortgage interest rates and, of course, an increased supply in the housing market.i would like to remind you of something that few people remember, which is that only 4,000 mortgage loans were issued in 2001.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"only 4,000.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"the interest rate was as high as 30 percent, including on foreign currency loans.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"by the way, half of the mortgage loans were issued in foreign currency.",PAFA
Russia,2018,few people could afford to take out mortgage loans then.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"last year, the number of mortgage loans almost reached one million.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"in december, the average interest rate on ruble loans for the first time decreased to below 10 percent.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"we know, of course, that loan terms are individual and may differ from one borrower to another.",PAFA
Russia,2018,but we must continue to lower the average interest rate to 7–8 percent.,PAFA
Russia,2018,we held long discussions on the figure i should say here.,PAFA
Russia,2018,i am sure that the target figure should be 7 percent.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"in the next six years, mortgage loans must become accessible to the majority of russian families, working people and young professionals.here are some more figures.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"in the 1950s through 1970s, we annually built approximately 60 million square metres of housing a year.",PAFA
Russia,2018,the figure rose to 70 million by the late 1990s.,PAFA
Russia,2018,now we annually build around 80 million square metres of housing every year.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"we built even more housing in some years, but the average figure is 80 million.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"we must move forward and reach new heights in this sphere, that is, increase the volume of housing built every year from 80 million to 120 million square metres.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"this is an ambitious but realistic goal, given new technologies, the experience our construction companies have accumulated, as well as new materials.",PAFA
Russia,2018,the rise from 80 to 120 million square metres is what we need and can achieve.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"i will tell you why: if we want 5 million families to receive new housing every year, we must reach the figure of 120 million square metres.those who invest their money in housing projects must be securely protected.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"we should gradually proceed from unit construction to project financing, when developers and banks, but not people, shoulder the risks.i also propose revising the personal property tax.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"it must be fair and affordable.some people, including those in this hall, tried to convince me that this tax should be based on the market value of property.",PAFA
Russia,2018,they told me that using obsolete valuation by the technical inventory bureau is an anachronism.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"but it turned out in reality that cadastral value, which should be comparable to market value, often exceeded it by far.",PAFA
Russia,2018,this was not the agreement.,PAFA
Russia,2018,and the people did not expect this from us.we must revise the mechanism for calculating the tax and also the calculation of the cadastral value of property.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"one way or another, it must not exceed the real market value.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"all decisions regarding this must be taken without delay in the first six months of this year.colleagues,we must penetrate the whole country with advanced communications to develop cities, towns, to enhance business activity and to meld together russia’s entire territory.the crimean bridge will open to cars in just a few months and to trains next year.",PAFA
Russia,2018,this will stimulate the development of crimea and the entire russian black sea region.we have overhauled federal roads.,PAFA
Russia,2018,now we must modernise regional and local routes.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"i am not going to talk about the figures now, but i know them.",PAFA
Russia,2018,it is a fact that federal roads have mostly been renovated.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"the situation is somewhat worse with regional roads, and it is completely unacceptable with local roads.",PAFA
Russia,2018,i address this to regional and city heads: you must constantly focus your attention on the roads.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"you must improve the quality of road construction using advanced technology and solutions, infrastructure mortgage loans and life cycle contracts.of course, another critical task is to improve safety on the roads and to decrease the mortality rate in road accidents to the minimum.overall, in the next six years, we must almost double the spending on road construction and repairs in russia and to allocate more than 11 trillion roubles for this from all sources.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"this is a lot; keep in mind that we have allocated 6.4 trillion rubles in 2012–2017, but we need 11 trillion.large eurasian transport corridors will also be developing.",PAFA
Russia,2018,an automobile road that will become part of the europe – asia-pacific corridor is already under construction.,PAFA
Russia,2018,our chinese and kazakhstani partners involved in this project together with us have already completed their part.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"their sections have already been opened, so we need to speed up our work.the throughput capability of the baikal-amur mainline and the trans-siberian railway will grow 1.5 times, up to 180 million tonnes, in six years.",PAFA
Russia,2018,it will take seven days for containers from vladivostok to reach the western borders of russia.,PAFA
Russia,2018,this is just one of the infrastructure projects that will bring quick economic returns.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"it includes freight, so all investment will be paid off very quickly and will contribute to these regions’ development.the volume of transit shipments on our railways must grow almost fourfold.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"this means that russia will become a global leader in transit shipping between europe and asia.in 1990, the ports of the soviet union had an aggregate capacity of 600 million tonnes, but after the country broke apart, we lost almost half.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"in the early 2000s, russian ports could handle only 300 million tonnes.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"over the last 17 years, this figure has tripled.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"in early 2017, the aggregate port capacity in russia exceeded 1 billion tonnes for the first time in history.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"as you can see from the charts, this exceeds the level reached by the soviet union by more than two thirds.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"by the way, these are the figures for early 2017, and the capacity currently stands at 1,025 billion tonnes.we need to further expand this capacity, including by increasing the capacity of railway links to ports in the azov and black sea basin 1.5-fold to 131 million tonnes.the northern sea route will be the key to developing the russian arctic and far east.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"by 2025, cargo traffic along this route will surge tenfold to 80 million tonnes.",PAFA
Russia,2018,our goal is to make it a truly global and competitive transport route.,PAFA
Russia,2018,let me remind you that the northern sea route was used more actively in soviet times compared to how we have been using it so far.,PAFA
Russia,2018,we will definitely develop this route and reach new horizons.,PAFA
Russia,2018,i have no doubt about it.we will continue our proactive policy to attract investment and create social and economic growth centres in russia’s far east.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"we will create all the conditions to ensure a people-friendly living environment, so that people move to this region and its population grows.a number of large-scale industrial projects have been launched in the arctic.",PAFA
Russia,2018,they comply with the highest environmental standards.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"we are strengthening the research, transport, navigation and military infrastructure, which is expected to guarantee russia’s interests in this strategic region.",PAFA
Russia,2018,russia builds cutting-edge nuclear icebreakers.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"we have had the most powerful icebreaker fleet in the world, and this will remain so.we will renovate and expand the network of regional airports across russia.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"in six years, half of the regions will be connected between each other by direct flights.",PAFA
Russia,2018,the situation where you had to make a connection in moscow when flying to a neighbouring region will become a thing of the past.,PAFA
Russia,2018,we are already working on this.,PAFA
Russia,2018,this includes efforts to develop aviation and airports.the spatial development strategy will serve as a foundation for preparing a comprehensive plan to modernise and expand the backbone traffic infrastructure.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"i believe this to be a priority for the future government.russia must not just become the world’s key logistics and transport hub, but also, which is very important, a global centre for the storage, processing, transfer and reliable protection of large volumes of information, so-called big data.overall, infrastructure development must take into account global technological changes.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"in other words, the projects we are now considering must include practical solutions for combining infrastructure with drones and digital marine and air navigation, as well as use ai to streamline logistics.likewise, we must introduce new technologies for the generation, storage and relay of energy.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"in the next six years, we plan to attract some 1.5 trillion rubles in private investment for modernising our power generation sector.",PAFA
Russia,2018,all power systems throughout the country must convert to digital technology.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"we must use the so-called distributed generation method to supply electricity to remote areas.by 2024, high-speed internet will be available throughout the country.",PAFA
Russia,2018,we will complete the construction of fibre optic lines in the majority of populated areas with a population of more than 250 people.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"small remote towns in the extreme north, siberia and the russian far east will access internet via a network of russian satellites.we will use advanced telecommunications to give our people access to the digital world.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"as we know, this is more than just modern services, online education and telemedicine, although all this is very important.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"more than that, people will be able to use digital space to conduct research, organise volunteer and project groups or run companies.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"in our vast country, this combination of talent, competencies and ideas amounts to a huge ground-breaking resource.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"colleagues,a crucial task facing every one of us is to make advanced high-quality healthcare widely accessible.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"we must be guided by the highest international standards in this area.in 2019–2024, we need to spend over 4 percent of the gdp each year to develop the healthcare system.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"at the same time, the goal we must bear in mind is 5 percent.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"in absolute terms, this means that healthcare spending must double.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"in addition, we must find new funding opportunities that would not limit economic growth.i would like to thank doctors, paramedics and nurses for their difficult and highly necessary work.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"a great deal depends on these people, as well as on teachers, counsellors and cultural workers, and they must receive decent salaries.we have done a lot to implement the 2012 may executive orders.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"i must say that there were several failures, but overall, despite the demanding targets of these orders, without them we would not have had the results we can see today.",PAFA
Russia,2018,we must always set ambitious tasks.we must not lose the positions we have already attained.,PAFA
Russia,2018,i am referring to the level of wages.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"wages in the public sector must continue growing, as well as the quality of work and skills of the people working in healthcare, education and other areas that define people’s wellbeing.in recent years, we have optimised the hospital network in the country.",PAFA
Russia,2018,this was done in order to build an effective healthcare system.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"however, in some case, i have to say this today, too many administrative changes were introduced: hospitals in small towns and villages have been closed.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"no one proposed an alternative, and people were left with practically no medical aid.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"the only advice they were given was, “go to the city to get treatment there.”",PAFA
Russia,2018,i must say that this is unacceptable.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"they forgot about the main thing: the people, their interests and needs, equal opportunities and justice.this must not happen in healthcare or any other area.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"we must provide, or restore where necessary, easy access to primary healthcare.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"we can do this, but we should have done this from the very beginning, when we started the reforms.this must be done as quickly as possible.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"in the period from 2018 to 2020, we must ensure that each small town with a population of 100 to 2,000 people has a paramedic station and an outpatient clinic.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"for villages with less than 100 people – we also have villages as small as that – we will organise mobile medical units, all-terrain vehicles with all the necessary diagnostic equipment.these projects should be closely monitored.",PAFA
Russia,2018,i consider them extremely important.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"and i also ask the russian popular front to stay in contact with people, to keep an eye on the situation on the ground.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"at the same time, outpatient clinics and paramedic stations, regional healthcare facilities and leading medical centres should be linked into a single digital network so that the entire national healthcare system is involved in helping each person.disease prevention is a vitally important task.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"in the 1990s, this work was largely neglected.",PAFA
Russia,2018,we began to restore it.,PAFA
Russia,2018,we need to provide all people with a real opportunity to have a complete physical at least once a year.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"this is also important for encouraging a responsible attitude to one's own health.modern diagnostics will reduce mortality among the working age population, and consolidate the positive trends in treating cardiovascular disorders.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"we can see these positive trends, which is very good.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"but we also need to fight other threats such as cancer.colleagues, i think that practically every one of us has relatives or friends or friends of friends afflicted with this disease – cancer.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"i propose to implement a special national cancer programme, to involve scientists and the national pharmaceutical industry, to modernise oncological centres, to build a modern system from early diagnosis to timely effective treatment that will protect people.",PAFA
Russia,2018,we have positive experience in this area.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"we must reach the cutting-edge, the highest level of all the key indicators that show the effectiveness of cancer care – experts should know what they are.colleagues,medical assistance alone is not enough to protect public health.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"we must also ensure high standards of environmental safety across russia.a long a healthy life is hard to achieve when millions of people drink substandard water, when we see black snow, as it happened in krasnoyarsk, and when people in large industrial centres such as cherepovets, nizhny tagil, chelyabinsk or novokuznetsk do not see the sun for weeks on end.we have tightened environmental requirements for companies, which should reduce industrial pollution.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"starting in 2019, 300 industrial enterprises with a negative impact on the environment must convert to the best available environmentally friendly technology, and all enterprises in the high environmental risk group must do this starting in 2021.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"we had a go at this problem many times, and every time our companies complained about the difficulties involved.",PAFA
Russia,2018,there is no going back now.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"i want everyone to know that we will not delay this programme any longer.we also need to modernise our thermal power plants, boiler houses and utility services, build bypass routes to ease transit traffic congestion in large cities, as well as use low-impact public service vehicles.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"the authorities and public volunteers have reported some 22,000 landfill sites.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"we must address this problem as a priority, starting with the removal and reclamation of landfill sites within city limits.",PAFA
Russia,2018,we must seriously improve the quality of drinking water.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"in some small towns, water is only available for several hours a day.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"we must use defence industry technologies to settle these problems.we will launch conservation projects for the unique natural systems of lake baikal and lake teletskoye, as well as the entire volga basin, which will help improve living conditions for nearly half of russia’s population.we will establish 24 new nature reserves and natural parks.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"they should be open for ecotourism, which is important for encouraging a caring and responsible attitude to nature.colleagues,the year 2018 in russia has been declared the year of volunteers.",PAFA
Russia,2018,it is highly symbolic that the year started with the adoption of a law whereby authorities at all levels were tasked with assisting volunteers.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"today, proactive and concerned citizens and socially-minded npos contribute to addressing crucial issues.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"it is the involvement of the people in national affairs and their civic engagement, as well as cultural, moral and spiritual values that make us a single people capable of achieving ambitious goals.it is essential that we preserve our identity in the era of major technological shifts.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"in this regard, culture has a key role to play as a national civilisational code that can unlock the human creative potential.i propose launching a programme to establish cultural, educational and museum complexes in the regions.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"they will offer concert venues, drama, music and dance schools and other creative institutions, as well as exhibition spaces where the country’s leading museums can display their treasures.",PAFA
Russia,2018,why store so many works of art in museum warehouses?,PAFA
Russia,2018,i am talking about centres of culture that would be open to young people and people of all ages.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"the first project of this kind will be carried out in vladivostok, and other regions and cities across russia will be selected at a later time.colleagues, our children want to see a forward-looking russia.",PAFA
Russia,2018,you can find many sincere reflections along these lines in school essays.,PAFA
Russia,2018,having bold dreams always helps if you are seeking to achieve an ambitious goal.,PAFA
Russia,2018,we must help every child discover his or her talent and help them live up to their potential.,PAFA
Russia,2018,the future of russia is in its classrooms.,PAFA
Russia,2018,schools must respond to the current challenges in order for the country to do the same.international experts agree that russia has one of the best primary school systems in the world.,PAFA
Russia,2018,we will keep up our proactive efforts to develop general education at all levels.,PAFA
Russia,2018,let me emphasise that every child should have access to a quality education.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"equal educational opportunities are a powerful driver in terms of promoting national development and social justice.we need to shift to completely new education methods, including personalised learning, in order to cultivate in our children a readiness for change and creative curiosity, and teach them to work in teams, which is very important in the modern world, and other life skills applicable to the digital era.",PAFA
Russia,2018,we will absolutely support talented teachers who are motivated to pursue continuous professional growth.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"and, of course, we need to build an open and modern system for school management selection and training.",PAFA
Russia,2018,school administrators are the ones in charge of building a strong faculty and productive morale.we will continue to enhance the comprehensive system to support and develop our children’s creative skills and talents.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"this system must extend to the entire country and incorporate the resources of such projects as sirius and quantorium, as well as extracurricular education centres and children’s creative centres all over russia.we need to build a modern career guidance system where schools partner with universities, research groups and successful companies.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"i propose starting a new early career guidance programme for schoolchildren, ticket to the future, from the next academic year.",PAFA
Russia,2018,the programme will allow kids to try out real jobs in major russian companies.,PAFA
Russia,2018,we will allocate 1 billion rubles for this project this year alone.i believe mentorship is another important aspect to improve.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"only by bringing together advanced knowledge and moral foundations, by ensuring a true partnership and mutual understanding between generations can we become stronger.colleagues, today knowledge, technology and expertise make the most important competitive advantages.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"they are the key to a real breakthrough and improved quality of life.as soon as possible, we need to develop a progressive legal framework and eliminate all barriers for the development and wide use of robotic equipment, artificial intelligence, unmanned vehicles, e-commerce and big data processing technology.",PAFA
Russia,2018,and this legal framework must be continuously reviewed and be based on a flexible approach to each area and technology.we have all the resources to promptly implement 5g and internet of things technologies.we need to build our own digital platforms.,PAFA
Russia,2018,it goes without saying that they should be compatible with the global information space.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"this would pave the way to reorganising manufacturing processes, financial services and logistics, including using blockchain technology, which is very important when it comes to financial transactions, property rights, etc.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"these initiatives have real-world application.we need to start making or localising key technologies and solutions, including those used in developing the arctic and the sea shelf, and building new energy, transport and urban infrastructure systems.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"this is also important in areas related to improving the quality of life, such as cutting-edge rehabilitation tools for people with disabilities.it is our duty to support high-technology companies, offer start-ups a favourable environment and introduce new industrial solutions.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"i am talking about a user-friendly infrastructure, taxation systems, technical regulations and venture financing.technological development should be firmly rooted in fundamental research.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"over the recent years, we have been able to expand research, and are now leading in a number of areas.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"the russian academy of sciences and russia’s leading research institutions made a major contribution to achieving this.building on the advances made in the preceding years, including in developing the research infrastructure, we need to take our research to a new level.",PAFA
Russia,2018,projects to build cutting-edge mega science research facilities are already underway in gatchina and dubna.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"the council for science and education has adopted a decision recently to build a powerful synchrotron collider at the novosibirsk akademgorodok and a new generation collider in protvino, moscow region.with these facilities, russia will become one of the world’s leading countries in terms of the capability and performance of its research infrastructure.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"these units will give a serious competitive edge to russian research teams and high-technology companies, for example for developing new medications, materials and microelectronics.of course, this infrastructure and ambitious research projects will not fail to attract our compatriots and researchers from abroad.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"in this regard, we need to create a legal framework that would enable international research teams to operate in russia.large research and education centres should begin working to full capacity.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"they will integrate the possibilities of universities, academic institutions, and high-tech companies.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"such centres are already being set up in kazan and samara, tomsk and novosibirsk, yekaterinburg and tyumen, vladivostok and kaliningrad, and other cities.it is important to focus them on the implementation of major interdisciplinary projects, including in such a promising field as genome research.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"a cardinal breakthrough in this area will pave the way to developing new methods for diagnosing, preventing and treating many diseases, and will expand the selection possibilities in agriculture.we need to reinforce the superiority of the national mathematics school.",PAFA
Russia,2018,it gives russia a strong competitive edge in the age of digital economy.,PAFA
Russia,2018,international mathematics centres will also provide platforms for such work.,PAFA
Russia,2018,these are already operating in kazan and novosibirsk.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"following the adopted decisions, we will open more in st petersburg, moscow and sochi.young russians are already proving their leadership in science and in other areas.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"last year, russian schoolchildren won 38 medals at international academic competitions.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"our teams triumphantly won the olympiad in natural sciences and robotics, the worldskills competition, and our students showed the best results in programming for the twelfth time.based on the best practices and experience, we need to quickly modernise the vocational education system, achieve qualitative changes in the training of students, especially in the advanced areas of technological development, to establish the ‘applied bachelor’ level in those vocational professions that actually require an engineering degree, and also to organise centres for advanced professional retraining and professional growth.i also propose creating the most convenient and attractive conditions for talented young people from other countries to enrol at our universities.",PAFA
Russia,2018,they already come to study here.,PAFA
Russia,2018,but we also need to create conditions for the best foreign graduates of our universities to work in russia.,PAFA
Russia,2018,this fully applies to foreign scientists and qualified specialists.i think we need to seriously improve the procedure for granting russian citizenship.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"the focus should be on the foreign nationals russia needs: on young, healthy and well-educated people.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"for them, we need to create a simplified system for obtaining russian citizenship.colleagues,to ensure breakthrough development and upgrade education, healthcare and the quality of the urban environment and infrastructure, it will be necessary to allocate considerable additional funds in the next six years for these purposes.question: at what expense?",PAFA
Russia,2018,where do we get these funds?,PAFA
Russia,2018,"first of all, it is essential to clearly prioritise these tasks and enhance the efficiency of government spending.",PAFA
Russia,2018,it is necessary to involve private companies more actively in funding major projects.,PAFA
Russia,2018,the future government will have to establish new taxation rules as soon as possible.,PAFA
Russia,2018,they should be stable and fixed for the next few years.let me emphasise that we need such fiscal solutions that would ensure budget revenues at all levels and guarantee the implementation of all social commitments.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"importantly, they should encourage rather than impede economic growth.",PAFA
Russia,2018,it is the build-up of economic potential of the country and each of its regions that is the main source of additional resources.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"to achieve this, our economic growth rates should exceed those of the world’s.",PAFA
Russia,2018,this is a difficult task but not instance case of wishful thinking.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"this is a fundamental condition for a breakthrough in resolving social, infrastructure, defence and other tasks.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"the new government should set itself the goal of reaching such growth rates as its key guideline.in the last few years, we have enhanced the sustainability of our economy.",PAFA
Russia,2018,the dependence of the economy on hydrocarbon prices has been substantially reduced.,PAFA
Russia,2018,we have increased our gold and currency reserves.,PAFA
Russia,2018,inflation has dropped to a record low level – just over two percent.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"of course, we all understand that the growth of prices for many basic necessities is much higher.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"this should be strictly monitored by different agencies, including the anti-monopoly service.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"but on the whole, this low inflation level creates additional opportunities for development.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"let me remind you that quite recently, in 2015, inflation was almost 13 percent – 12.9 percent to be exact.in effect, russia has formed a new macroeconomic reality with low inflation and general economic sustainability.",PAFA
Russia,2018,for the people this is a condition for real income growth and cheaper mortgage loans.,PAFA
Russia,2018,for entrepreneurs it means predictability in business and cheaper loans.,PAFA
Russia,2018,business should also adapt to these new macroeconomic conditions.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"finally, it makes it possible to attract long-term loans and private investment into large-scale infrastructure projects.now we have an opportunity, without speeding up inflation, and maintaining a careful and responsible approach, to gradually cut interest rates and make loans more affordable.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"i count on the support of the bank of russia in that, while making its decisions, implementing monetary policy measures and developing financial markets, it will work in contact with the government in the interests of the common goal of creating a proper environment for increasing the economic growth rates.in order to further change the national economy structure and improve its competitiveness, it is imperative to use the sources of growth at a fundamentally different level.",PAFA
Russia,2018,where are they?,PAFA
Russia,2018,"first of all, it is important to increase labour productivity on a new technological, managerial and personnel basis.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"we are still lagging noticeably behind in terms of this indicator.it is necessary to ensure that labour productivity in medium-sized and large enterprises of basic industries, such as manufacturing, construction, transport, agriculture and trade, grows at a rate of at least 5 percent per year, which will allow us to reach the level of the leading world economies by the end of the next decade.i want to emphasise that increasing productivity is also about higher wages and, hence, increased consumer demand.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"in turn, this constitutes an additional driver for economic growth.all our actions should push companies to produce technically complex products and to implement more efficient technologies.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"it is necessary to make an inventory of subsidies and other instruments for direct support of industries, and to target them on making competitive goods.increased investment is the second source of growth.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"we have already set the task of bringing it up to 25 percent of the gdp, and then to 27 percent.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"unfortunately, this goal has not been achieved yet.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"to ensure sustainable growth, we need to do so at all costs.",PAFA
Russia,2018,i hope that the new government in conjunction with the bank of russia will present a concrete plan of action in this area.investment should be primarily used for upgrading and technologically re-equipping the industries and retrofitting the manufacturing industry.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"we need to ensure the highest dynamics here, to reach a level where, on average, every second enterprise within a year carries out technological changes.",PAFA
Russia,2018,that is when the renewal effort in the economy and industry will be noticeable.promoting small businesses is the third large-scale reserve of economic growth.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"by the middle of the next decade, their contribution to the country's gdp should approach 40 percent, and the number of employed there should grow from 19 million to 25 million people.one of the main problems facing entrepreneurs is access to financial resources.",PAFA
Russia,2018,there is a government programme in place for small production businesses that offers loans with only 6.5 percent interest.,PAFA
Russia,2018,i think this programme must continue.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"overall, this support mechanism must become widely available.finally, another source of growth is the development of non-resource exports.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"it is necessary to remove all administrative barriers and create the most favourable conditions for the companies entering foreign markets.within the next six years, we must double the amount of non-resource and non-energy exports to reach $250 billion – specifically, increase machine engineering exports to $50 billion.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"exports of services, including education, healthcare, tourism and transport, must reach $100 billion per year.in the early 2000s, we were deeply dependent on food imports.",PAFA
Russia,2018,the situation has turned around completely.,PAFA
Russia,2018,now we are on the verge of more changes.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"in just four years from now, we plan to be supplying more food to global markets than we will be importing from abroad.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"we need to increase exports of meat and high-added value products, as well as to make the country more self-sufficient in beef, milk and vegetable supplies.i want to stress that development of the agricultural industry is strongly related to commodity production.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"however, this development must not be at the expense of small farms and their workers.",PAFA
Russia,2018,we must support family businesses and farmers.,PAFA
Russia,2018,we will develop cooperative agriculture and create conditions for residents of rural areas to increase their income.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"every now and then we hear about problems with people’s interests being affected, i am aware of them.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"such cases must be taken very seriously.nevertheless, i want to say thank you to the agricultural industry workers for the record-breaking harvest of 134 million tonnes.",PAFA
Russia,2018,note that it is more than the record harvest in the soviet union.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"in 1978, the ussr produced 127.4 million tonnes.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"now it is common for russia to exceed 100 million tonnes.clearly, such a large harvest has a downside as well.",PAFA
Russia,2018,the prices have gone down; there are some storage and transport issues.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"we have established discount rates on transporting crops by railway until july 1, 2018, to support our producers.it is necessary to consider extending this measure to the next harvesting seasons as well as to arrange additional deliveries to the urals, siberia and the regions far away from ports.",PAFA
Russia,2018,we must help those who want and can process crops locally.,PAFA
Russia,2018,added value needs to be increased.,PAFA
Russia,2018,then we can go into the livestock industry with this product.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"we will certainly discuss these and other problems reported by agricultural workers at the agricultural producers’ forum in march, and will elaborate on additional measures to support the industry.colleagues,in order for the economy to operate at its full capacity, we need to radically improve the business climate and guarantee entrepreneurial freedom and competition.let me highlight a fundamental point in this regard.",PAFA
Russia,2018,the state must gradually reduce its share in the economy.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"in this connection, it has to be noted that the state has taken over a number of financial assets in an effort to revive the banking sector.",PAFA
Russia,2018,these initiatives are headed in the right direction and have my support.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"that said, these assets should be put on the market and sold without delay.we need to get rid of everything that enables corrupt officials and law enforcement officers to pressure businesses.",PAFA
Russia,2018,the criminal code should not serve as a tool for settling corporate disputes.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"these should be referred to administrative and arbitration courts.i ask the working group on monitoring and analysing law enforcement practice in entrepreneurial activity, together with the supreme court, law enforcement agencies, the prosecutor’s office and representatives of the business community to draft specific proposals on this subject.",PAFA
Russia,2018,this matter should not be approached in a light-minded manner.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"all the proposals must undergo careful examination and approval, and this should be done as soon as possible.at the same time, criminal law should be strictly enforced in the case of offences infringing upon the interests of citizens or society or violating economic freedoms.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"i am referring to offences against property and assets held by citizens, illegal takeovers, competition law violations, tax evasion and embezzlement of public funds.i would now like to move on to another important subject.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"while the number of various inspections seems to be declining, during meetings with businesses i often hear that radical change has yet to materialise.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"the presence of inspectors at enterprises should become the exception, and be limited to high-risk facilities.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"otherwise, remote monitoring methods can be used.",PAFA
Russia,2018,the entire control and oversight system should move to a risk-oriented approach within two years.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"let me remind you that the relevant legislative framework is already in place.it is important to support start-up entrepreneurs, to help people take the first step, so that they can open their own businesses with just one click, make the compulsory payments, receive services and loans online.sole proprietors and self-employed individuals who use digital services, generally need to be freed from reporting, and allowed to pay taxes via a simple transaction in automatic mode.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"as for businesses that use cash register equipment, their tax reporting needs to be simplified.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"you know, this is just a routine issue, at first glance, but this tedious routine is what prevents us from moving forward vigorously.",PAFA
Russia,2018,we need to do everything to clean out this space.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"i will add that the intensive introduction of digital technologies and platforms will allow us to make consistent progress towards greater transparency and away from shadow economy.now i would like to address all representatives of russian business, those who run their own small business, a family enterprise or a farm, an innovative company or a large industrial enterprise.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"i know, i know we still have a lot to do.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"and i assure you, we will do everything to give our entrepreneurs new opportunities to expand production, to open businesses and to create modern jobs.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"but at the same time i expect that russian business will increase its contribution to the country's breakthrough development, and respect for entrepreneurial work in society will grow.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"it is very important.colleagues, we need to build modern services for business, but this is not all; the system for interaction between the state and society, between the state and the people should be clear and understandable, convenient and comfortable.we have already set up a network of multifunctional centres.",PAFA
Russia,2018,a person anywhere in the country can now use public services as a one-stop-shop.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"allow me to remind you that it was a special programme which we have developed and implemented.we need to move forward, to ensure the provision of virtually all public services in real time via remote services within six years.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"all document circulation between state agencies should be digitised, which is important both for the state agencies and for citizens, so as not to browse the internet for hours looking for information.",PAFA
Russia,2018,it will be possible to get everything in one place.,PAFA
Russia,2018,i will add that digitalisation of the entire public administration system and its greater transparency is also a powerful factor in fighting corruption.government officials of all levels should be interested in improving their efficiency and be strictly focused on obtaining concrete results.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"by the way, we are always talking about corruption and officials.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"i have to say, and i do not have the right to not say this: the vast majority of our public servants are honest, decent and goal-oriented people.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"however, what i said will help everyone, including government officials and users of government services.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"this line of thinking should be used to rebuild the public service system, where appropriate, and to introduce project work methods.of course, it is necessary to ensure the advancement of modern professional personnel in the government and municipal service, business, the economy, science and industry, in all spheres.as you may be aware, the first leaders of russia competition took place, and a number of other projects are being implemented to support young workers, entrepreneurs, innovators, volunteers, schoolchildren and students.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"they brought together hundreds of thousands of young people from all regions, and became an important step in their lives and professional careers.i want to emphasise: for all those who want to work, show themselves, and are ready to honestly serve the fatherland and the people, and to succeed, russia will always be a country of opportunity.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"this is the guarantee of our successful development and confident movement forward.all the projects and the priorities that i mentioned today, such as spatial development, investment in infrastructure, education, healthcare, the environment, innovative technologies and research, measures to support the economy, to promote talent, the youth, all of this is designed to work for one strategic task – russia’s breakthrough development.at the same time, we cannot forget about reliably ensuring its security.colleagues,the operation in syria has proved the increased capabilities of the russian armed forces.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"in recent years, a great deal has been done to improve the army and the navy.",PAFA
Russia,2018,the armed forces now have 3.7 times more modern weapons.,PAFA
Russia,2018,over 300 new units of equipment were put into service.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"the strategic missile troops received 80 new intercontinental ballistic missiles, 102 submarine-launched ballistic missiles and three borei nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines.",PAFA
Russia,2018,twelve missile regiments have received the new yars intercontinental ballistic missile.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"the number of long-range high-precision weapons carriers has increased by 12 times, while the number of guided cruise missiles increased by over 30 times.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"the army, the aerospace forces and the navy have grown significant stronger as well.both russia and the entire world know the names of our newest planes, submarines, anti-aircraft weapons, as well as land-based, airborne and sea-based guided missile systems.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"all of them are cutting-edge, high-tech weapons.",PAFA
Russia,2018,a solid radar field to warn of a missile attack was created along russia’s perimeter (it is very important).,PAFA
Russia,2018,huge holes appeared after the ussr disintegrated.,PAFA
Russia,2018,all of them were repaired.a leap forward was made in the development of unmanned aircraft; the national defence control centre was established; and the operational command of the far maritime zone was formed.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"the number of professional service members has increased by 2.4 times, and the availability of equipment in the armed forces grew from 70 percent to 95–100 percent.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"the years-long queue for permanent housing was eliminated, and the waiting period was cut by 83 percent.now, on to the most important defence issue.i will speak about the newest systems of russian strategic weapons that we are creating in response to the unilateral withdrawal of the united states of america from the anti-ballistic missile treaty and the practical deployment of their missile defence systems both in the us and beyond their national borders.i would like to make a short journey into the recent past.back in 2000, the us announced its withdrawal from the anti-ballistic missile treaty.",PAFA
Russia,2018,russia was categorically against this.,PAFA
Russia,2018,we saw the soviet-us abm treaty signed in 1972 as the cornerstone of the international security system.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"under this treaty, the parties had the right to deploy ballistic missile defence systems only in one of its regions.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"russia deployed these systems around moscow, and the us around its grand forks land-based icbm base.together with the strategic arms reduction treaty, the abm treaty not only created an atmosphere of trust but also prevented either party from recklessly using nuclear weapons, which would have endangered humankind, because the limited number of ballistic missile defence systems made the potential aggressor vulnerable to a response strike.",PAFA
Russia,2018,we did our best to dissuade the americans from withdrawing from the treaty.,PAFA
Russia,2018,all in vain.,PAFA
Russia,2018,the us pulled out of the treaty in 2002.,PAFA
Russia,2018,even after that we tried to develop constructive dialogue with the americans.,PAFA
Russia,2018,we proposed working together in this area to ease concerns and maintain the atmosphere of trust.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"at one point, i thought that a compromise was possible, but this was not to be.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"all our proposals, absolutely all of them, were rejected.",PAFA
Russia,2018,and then we said that we would have to improve our modern strike systems to protect our security.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"in reply, the us said that it is not creating a global bmd system against russia, which is free to do as it pleases, and that the us will presume that our actions are not spearheaded against the us.the reasons behind this position are obvious.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"after the collapse of the ussr, russia, which was known as the soviet union or soviet russia abroad, lost 23.8 percent of its national territory, 48.5 percent of its population, 41 of the gdp, 39.4 percent of its industrial potential (nearly half of our potential, i would underscore), as well as 44.6 percent of its military capability due to the division of the soviet armed forces among the former soviet republics.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"the military equipment of the russian army was becoming obsolete, and the armed forces were in a sorry state.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"a civil war was raging in the caucasus, and us inspectors oversaw the operation of our leading uranium enrichment plants.for a certain time, the question was not whether we would be able to develop a strategic weapon system – some wondered if our country would even be able to safely store and maintain the nuclear weapons that we inherited after the collapse of the ussr.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"russia had outstanding debts, its economy could not function without loans from the imf and the world bank; the social sphere was impossible to sustain.apparently, our partners got the impression that it was impossible in the foreseeable historical perspective for our country to revive its economy, industry, defence industry and armed forces to levels supporting the necessary strategic potential.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"and if that is the case, there is no point in reckoning with russia’s opinion, it is necessary to further pursue ultimate unilateral military advantage in order to dictate the terms in every sphere in the future.basically, this position, this logic, judging from the realities of that period, is understandable, and we ourselves are to blame.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"all these years, the entire 15 years since the withdrawal of the united states from the anti-ballistic missile treaty, we have consistently tried to reengage the american side in serious discussions, in reaching agreements in the sphere of strategic stability.we managed to accomplish some of these goals.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"in 2010, russia and the us signed the new start treaty, containing measures for the further reduction and limitation of strategic offensive arms.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"however, in light of the plans to build a global anti-ballistic missile system, which are still being carried out today, all agreements signed within the framework of new start are now gradually being devaluated, because while the number of carriers and weapons is being reduced, one of the parties, namely, the us, is permitting constant, uncontrolled growth of the number of anti-ballistic missiles, improving their quality, and creating new missile launching areas.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"if we do not do something, eventually this will result in the complete devaluation of russia’s nuclear potential.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"meaning that all of our missiles could simply be intercepted.despite our numerous protests and pleas, the american machine has been set into motion, the conveyer belt is moving forward.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"there are new missile defence systems installed in alaska and california; as a result of nato’s expansion to the east, two new missile defence areas were created in western europe: one has already been created in romania, while the deployment of the system in poland is now almost complete.",PAFA
Russia,2018,their range will keep increasing; new launching areas are to be created in japan and south korea.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"the us global missile defence system also includes five cruisers and 30 destroyers, which, as far as we know, have been deployed to regions in close proximity to russia’s borders.",PAFA
Russia,2018,i am not exaggerating in the least; and this work proceeds apace.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"so, what have we done, apart from protesting and warning?",PAFA
Russia,2018,how will russia respond to this challenge?,PAFA
Russia,2018,"this is how.during all these years since the unilateral us withdrawal from the abm treaty, we have been working intensively on advanced equipment and arms, which allowed us to make a breakthrough in developing new models of strategic weapons.let me recall that the united states is creating a global missile defence system primarily for countering strategic arms that follow ballistic trajectories.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"these weapons form the backbone of our nuclear deterrence forces, just as of other members of the nuclear club.as such, russia has developed, and works continuously to perfect, highly effective but modestly priced systems to overcome missile defence.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"they are installed on all of our intercontinental ballistic missile complexes.in addition, we have embarked on the development of the next generation of missiles.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"for example, the defence ministry and enterprises of the missile and aerospace industry are in the active phase of testing a new missile system with a heavy intercontinental missile.",PAFA
Russia,2018,we called it sarmat.,PAFA
Russia,2018,sarmat will replace the voevoda system made in the ussr.,PAFA
Russia,2018,its immense power was universally recognized.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"our foreign colleagues even gave it a fairly threatening name.that said, the capabilities of the sarmat missile are much higher.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"weighing over 200 tonnes, it has a short boost phase, which makes it more difficult to intercept for missile defence systems.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"the range of the new heavy missile, the number and power of its combat blocs is bigger than voevoda’s.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"sarmat will be equipped with a broad range of powerful nuclear warheads, including hypersonic, and the most modern means of evading missile defence.",PAFA
Russia,2018,the high degree of protection of missile launchers and significant energy capabilities the system offers will make it possible to use it in any conditions.could you please show the video.(,PAFA
Russia,2018,video plays.),PAFA
Russia,2018,"voevoda’s range is 11,000 km while sarmat has practically no range restrictions.as the video clips show, it can attack targets both via the north and south poles.sarmat is a formidable missile and, owing to its characteristics, is untroubled by even the most advanced missile defence systems.but we did not stop at that.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"we started to develop new types of strategic arms that do not use ballistic trajectories at all when moving toward a target and, therefore, missile defence systems are useless against them, absolutely pointless.allow me to elaborate on these weapons.russia’s advanced arms are based on the cutting-edge, unique achievements of our scientists, designers and engineers.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"one of them is a small-scale heavy-duty nuclear energy unit that can be installed in a missile like our latest x-101 air-launched missile or the american tomahawk missile – a similar type but with a range dozens of times longer, dozens, basically an unlimited range.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"it is a low-flying stealth missile carrying a nuclear warhead, with almost an unlimited range, unpredictable trajectory and ability to bypass interception boundaries.",PAFA
Russia,2018,it is invincible against all existing and prospective missile defence and counter-air defence systems.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"i will repeat this several times today.in late 2017, russia successfully launched its latest nuclear-powered missile at the central training ground.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"during its flight, the nuclear-powered engine reached its design capacity and provided the necessary propulsion.now that the missile launch and ground tests were successful, we can begin developing a completely new type of weapon, a strategic nuclear weapons system with a nuclear-powered missile.roll the video, please.",PAFA
Russia,2018,(video plays.),PAFA
Russia,2018,you can see how the missile bypasses interceptors.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"as the range is unlimited, the missile can manoeuvre for as long as necessary.as you no doubt understand, no other country has developed anything like this.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"there will be something similar one day but by that time our guys will have come up with something even better.now, we all know that the design and development of unmanned weapon systems is another common trend in the world.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"as concerns russia, we have developed unmanned submersible vehicles that can move at great depths (i would say extreme depths) intercontinentally, at a speed multiple times higher than the speed of submarines, cutting-edge torpedoes and all kinds of surface vessels, including some of the fastest.",PAFA
Russia,2018,it is really fantastic.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"they are quiet, highly manoeuvrable and have hardly any vulnerabilities for the enemy to exploit.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"there is simply nothing in the world capable of withstanding them.unmanned underwater vehicles can carry either conventional or nuclear warheads, which enables them to engage various targets, including aircraft groups, coastal fortifications and infrastructure.in december 2017, an innovative nuclear power unit for this unmanned underwater vehicle completed a test cycle that lasted many years.",PAFA
Russia,2018,the nuclear power unit is unique for its small size while offering an amazing power-weight ratio.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"it is a hundred times smaller than the units that power modern submarines, but is still more powerful and can switch into combat mode, that is to say, reach maximum capacity, 200 times faster.the tests that were conducted enabled us to begin developing a new type of strategic weapon that would carry massive nuclear ordnance.please play the video.",PAFA
Russia,2018,(video plays.),PAFA
Russia,2018,"by the way, we have yet to choose names for these two new strategic weapons, the global-range cruise missile and the unmanned underwater vehicle.",PAFA
Russia,2018,we are waiting for suggestions from the defence ministry.countries with high research potential and advanced technology are known to be actively developing so-called hypersonic weapons.,PAFA
Russia,2018,the speed of sound is usually measured in mach numbers in honour of austrian scientist ernst mach who is known for his research in this field.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"one mach is equal to 1,062 kilometres per hour at an altitude of 11 kilometres.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"the speed of sound is mach 1, speeds between mach 1 and mach 5 is called supersonic, and hypersonic is above mach 5.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"of course, this kind of weapon provides substantial advantages in an armed conflict.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"military experts believe that it would be extremely powerful, and that its speed makes it invulnerable to current missile and air defence systems, since interceptor missiles are, simply put, not fast enough.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"in this regard, it is quite understandable why the leading armies of the world seek to possess such an ideal weapon.friends, russia already has such a weapon.the most important stage in the development of modern weapons systems was the creation of a high-precision hypersonic aircraft missile system; as you already know for sure, it is the only one of its kind in the world.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"its tests have been successfully completed, and, moreover, on december 1 of last year, these systems began their trial service at the airfields of the southern military district.the unique flight characteristics of the high-speed carrier aircraft allow the missile to be delivered to the point of discharge within minutes.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"the missile flying at a hypersonic speed, 10 times faster than the speed of sound, can also manoeuvre at all phases of its flight trajectory, which also allows it to overcome all existing and, i think, prospective anti-aircraft and anti-missile defence systems, delivering nuclear and conventional warheads in a range of over 2,000 kilometres.",PAFA
Russia,2018,we called this system kinzhal (dagger).,PAFA
Russia,2018,"video, please.(",PAFA
Russia,2018,video plays.),PAFA
Russia,2018,"but this is not all i have to say.a real technological breakthrough is the development of a strategic missile system with fundamentally new combat equipment – a gliding wing unit, which has also been successfully tested.i will say once again what we have repeatedly told our american and european partners who are nato members: we will make the necessary efforts to neutralise the threats posed by the deployment of the us global missile defence system.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"we mentioned this during talks, and even said it publicly.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"back in 2004, after the exercises of the strategic nuclear forces when the system was tested for the first time, i said the following at a meeting with the press (it is embarrassing to quote myself, but it is the right thing to say here):so, i said: “as other countries increase the number and quality of their arms and military potential, russia will also need to ensure it has new generation weapons and technology.in this respect, i am pleased to inform you that successfully completed experiments during these exercises enable us to confirm that in the near future, the russian armed forces, the strategic missile forces, will receive new hypersonic-speed, high-precision new weapons systems that can hit targets at inter-continental distance and can adjust their altitude and course as they travel.",PAFA
Russia,2018,this is a very significant statement because no country in the world as of now has such arms in their military arsenal.”,PAFA
Russia,2018,"end of quote.of course, every word has a meaning because we are talking about the possibility of bypassing interception boundaries.",PAFA
Russia,2018,why did we do all this?,PAFA
Russia,2018,why did we talk about it?,PAFA
Russia,2018,"as you can see, we made no secret of our plans and spoke openly about them, primarily to encourage our partners to hold talks.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"let me repeat, this was in 2004.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"it is actually surprising that despite all the problems with the economy, finances and the defence industry, russia has remained a major nuclear power.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"no, nobody really wanted to talk to us about the core of the problem, and nobody wanted to listen to us.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"so listen now.unlike existing types of combat equipment, this system is capable of intercontinental flight at supersonic speeds in excess of mach 20.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"as i said in 2004, in moving to its target, the missile’s gliding cruise bloc engages in intensive manoeuvring – both lateral (by several thousand km) and vertical.",PAFA
Russia,2018,this is what makes it absolutely invulnerable to any air or missile defence system.,PAFA
Russia,2018,the use of new composite materials has made it possible to enable the gliding cruise bloc to make a long-distance guided flight practically in conditions of plasma formation.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"it flies to its target like a meteorite, like a ball of fire.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"the temperature on its surface reaches 1,600–2,000 degrees celsius but the cruise bloc is reliably guided.play the video, please.(",PAFA
Russia,2018,video plays).,PAFA
Russia,2018,for obvious reasons we cannot show the outer appearance of this system here.,PAFA
Russia,2018,this is still very important.,PAFA
Russia,2018,i hope everyone understands this.,PAFA
Russia,2018,but let me assure you that we have all this and it is working well.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"moreover, russian industrial enterprises have embarked on the development of another new type of strategic weapon.",PAFA
Russia,2018,we called it the avangard.we are well aware that a number of other countries are developing advanced weapons with new physical properties.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"we have every reason to believe that we are one step ahead there as well – at any rate, in the most essential areas.we have achieved significant progress in laser weapons.",PAFA
Russia,2018,it is not just a concept or a plan any more.,PAFA
Russia,2018,it is not even in the early production stages.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"since last year, our troops have been armed with laser weapons.i do not want to reveal more details.",PAFA
Russia,2018,it is not the time yet.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"but experts will understand that with such weaponry, russia’s defence capacity has multiplied.here is another short video.(",PAFA
Russia,2018,video plays.),PAFA
Russia,2018,"those interested in military equipment are welcome to suggest a name for this new weaponry, this cutting-edge system.of course, we will be refining this state-of-the-art technology.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"obviously, there is far more in development than i have mentioned today.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"but this is enough for now.i want to specifically emphasise that the newly developed strategic arms – in fact, new types of strategic weapons – are not the result of something left over from the soviet union.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"of course, we relied on some ideas from our ingenious predecessors.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"but everything i have described today is the result of the last several years, the product of dozens of research organisations, design bureaus and institutes.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"thousands, literally thousands of our experts, outstanding scientists, designers, engineers, passionate and talented workers have been working for years, quietly, humbly, selflessly, with total dedication.",PAFA
Russia,2018,there are many young professionals among them.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"they are our true heroes, along with our military personnel who demonstrated the best qualities of the russian army in combat.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"i want to address each of them right now and say that there will absolutely be awards, prizes and honorary titles but, because i have met many of you in person many times, i know you are not after awards.",PAFA
Russia,2018,the most important thing is to reliably ensure the security of our country and our people.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"as president and on behalf of the russian people, i want to say thank you very much for your hard work and its results.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"our country needs them so much.as i have already said, all future military products are based on remarkable advances that can, should and will be used in high-technology civilian sectors.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"i would like to stress that only a country with the highest level of fundamental research and education, developed research, technology, industrial infrastructure and human resources can successfully develop unique and complex weapons of this kind.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"you can see that russia has all these resources.we will expand this potential and focus on delivering on the ambitious goals our country has set itself in terms of economic, social and infrastructure development.",PAFA
Russia,2018,effective defence will serve as a guarantee of russia’s long-term development.let me reiterate that each of the armament systems i referred to is uniquely important.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"even more importantly, taken together all these advances enable the defence ministry and general staff to develop a comprehensive defence system, in which every piece of new military equipment will be assigned a proper role.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"on top of strategic weapons that are currently on combat alert and benefit from regular updates, russia will have a defence capability that would guarantee its security in the long term.of course, there are many things that we have to do in terms of military construction, but one thing is already clear: russia possesses a modern, high-technology army that is quite compact given the size of the territory, centred on the officer corps, who are dedicated to their country and are ready to sacrifice anything for its people.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"sooner or later, other armies will also have the technology, the weapons, even the most advanced ones.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"but this does not worry us, since we already have it and will have even better armaments in the future.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"what matters is that they will never have people or officers like the russian pilot major roman filipov.i hope that everything that was said today would make any potential aggressor think twice, since unfriendly steps against russia such as deploying missile defences and bringing nato infrastructure closer to the russian border become ineffective in military terms and entail unjustified costs, making them useless for those promoting these initiatives.it was our duty to inform our partners of what i said here today under the international commitments russia had subscribed to.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"when the time comes, foreign and defence ministry experts will have many opportunities to discuss all these matters with them, if of course our partners so desire.for my part, i should note that we have conducted the work to reinforce russia's defence capability within the current arms control agreements; we are not violating anything.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"i should specifically say that russia's growing military strength is not a threat to anyone; we have never had any plans to use this potential for offensive, let alone aggressive goals.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"we are not threatening anyone, not going to attack anyone or take away anything from anyone with the threat of weapons.",PAFA
Russia,2018,we do not need anything.,PAFA
Russia,2018,just the opposite.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"i deem it necessary to emphasise (and it is very important) that russia's growing military power is a solid guarantee of global peace as this power preserves and will preserve strategic parity and the balance of forces in the world, which, as is known, have been and remain a key factor of international security after wwii and up to the present day.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"and to those who in the past 15 years have tried to accelerate an arms race and seek unilateral advantage against russia, have introduced restrictions and sanctions that are illegal from the standpoint of international law aiming to restrain our nation's development, including in the military area, i will say this: everything you have tried to prevent through such a policy has already happened.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"no one has managed to restrain russia.now we have to be aware of this reality and be sure that everything i have said today is not a bluff ‒ and it is not a bluff, believe me ‒ and to give it a thought and dismiss those who live in the past and are unable to look into the future, to stop rocking the boat we are all in and which is called the earth.in this connection, i would like to note the following.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"we are greatly concerned by certain provisions of the revised nuclear posture review, which expand the opportunities for reducing and reduce the threshold for the use of nuclear arms.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"behind closed doors, one may say anything to calm down anyone, but we read what is written.",PAFA
Russia,2018,and what is written is that this strategy can be put into action in response to conventional arms attacks and even to a cyber-threat.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"i should note that our military doctrine says russia reserves the right to use nuclear weapons solely in response to a nuclear attack, or an attack with other weapons of mass destruction against the country or its allies, or an act of aggression against us with the use of conventional weapons that threaten the very existence of the state.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"this all is very clear and specific.as such, i see it is my duty to announce the following.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"any use of nuclear weapons against russia or its allies, weapons of short, medium or any range at all, will be considered as a nuclear attack on this country.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"retaliation will be immediate, with all the attendant consequences.",PAFA
Russia,2018,there should be no doubt about this whatsoever.,PAFA
Russia,2018,there is no need to create more threats to the world.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"instead, let us sit down at the negotiating table and devise together a new and relevant system of international security and sustainable development for human civilisation.",PAFA
Russia,2018,we have been saying this all along.,PAFA
Russia,2018,all these proposals are still valid.,PAFA
Russia,2018,russia is ready for this.our policies will never be based on claims to exceptionalism.,PAFA
Russia,2018,we protect our interests and respect the interests of other countries.,PAFA
Russia,2018,we observe international law and believe in the inviolable central role of the un.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"these are the principles and approaches that allow us to build strong, friendly and equal relations with the absolute majority of countries.our comprehensive strategic partnership with the people’s republic of china is one example.",PAFA
Russia,2018,russia and india also enjoy a special privileged strategic relationship.,PAFA
Russia,2018,our relations with many other countries in the world are entering a new dynamic stage.russia is widely involved in international organisations.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"with our partners, we are advancing such associations and groups as the csto, the shanghai cooperation organisation and brics.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"we are promoting a positive agenda at the un, g20 and apec.",PAFA
Russia,2018,we are interested in normal and constructive cooperation with the united states and the european union.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"we hope that common sense will prevail and our partners will opt for honest and equal work together.even if our views clash on some issues, we still remain partners because we must work together to respond to the most complex challenges, ensure global security, and build the future world, which is becoming increasingly interconnected, with more and more dynamic integration processes.russia and its partners in the eurasian economic union seek to make it a globally competitive integration group.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"the eaeu’s agenda includes building a common market for electricity, oil, petroleum products and gas, harmonising financial markets, and linking our customs authorities.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"we will also continue to work on a greater eurasian partnership.colleagues, this is a turning period for the entire world and those who are willing and able to change, those who are taking action and moving forward will take the lead.",PAFA
Russia,2018,russia and its people have expressed this will at every defining moment in our history.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"in just 30 years, we have undergone changes that took centuries in other countries.we will continue to confidently chart our own course, just as we always have.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"we will stick together, as we always have.",PAFA
Russia,2018,our unity is the most durable foundation for future progress.,PAFA
Russia,2018,"in the coming years, it is our goal to further strengthen this unity so that we are one team that understands that change is necessary and is ready to devote its energy, knowledge, experience and talent to achieving common goals.challenges and big goals give special meaning to our lives.",PAFA
Russia,2018,"we must be bold in our plans and actions, take responsibility and initiative, and grow stronger, which means being of use to our families, children, the whole country; changing the world and our country for the better; and creating the russia that we all dream about.",PAFA
Russia,2018,only then will the next decade and the entire 21st century undoubtedly be an age of outstanding triumphs for russia and our shared success.,PAFA
Russia,2018,i believe it will be so.,PAFA
Russia,2018,thank you.,PAFA
