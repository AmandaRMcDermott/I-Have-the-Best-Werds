"MoscowColleagues,Yesterday we paid farewell to First President of Russia Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin. I ask you to honour his memory with a minute of silence. * * *Deputies and members of the Federation Council,As you know, this tradition of making an annual address to the Federal Assembly — in effect a direct address to the people of Russia — was established by the 1993 Constitution, the Constitution adopted on the initiative of President Yeltsin. He believed it was crucially important to maintain a direct and open dialogue with the people. He believed in the need for public debate on state policy priorities and problems. He considered this to be a valuable instrument for bringing society together, a valuable instrument for building genuine democracy. Our country at that time was deeply divided by complex social conflicts, confrontation between parties and ideologies. Separatism represented a real threat to Russia’s security and territorial integrity. And as if this were not enough, resources for resolving the country’s most urgent and vital problems were in drastically short supply. But it was precisely during this difficult period that the foundations for future change were laid. We have worked together for many years to overcome the serious consequences of the transition period, to overcome the negative effects of far-reaching but not always straightforward transformation. In untangling the complex knots of social, economic and political problems, we have at the same time built a new life. As a result, the situation in the country is gradually, slowly, step by step, changing for the better. Not only has Russia now made a full turn-around after years of industrial decline, it has become one of the world’s ten-biggest economies. People’s real incomes have more than doubled since 2000. The income gap between our citizens is still unacceptably wide, but the measures taken over recent years have reduced the extent of poverty in Russia by almost half. We realise that we are still only at the beginning of the difficult road to our country’s full and genuine recovery. The more firmly our society pulls together, the quicker and more confidently we will complete this journey. The spiritual unity of the people and the moral values that unite us are just as important a factor for development as political and economic stability. It is my conviction that a society can set and achieve ambitious national goals only if it has a common system of moral guidelines. We will be able to achieve our goals only if we maintain respect for our native language, for our unique cultural values, for the memory of our forebears and for each page of our country’s history. This national treasure is the foundation for strengthening our country’s unity and sovereignty. It is the foundation for our everyday life and the basis on which we can build our economic and political relations. One of this year’s most important events is the election to the State Duma. What principle importance and unifying significance does this election have for our society? Above all, the results of this election will objectively reflect the level of support among the Russian public for the policies we have been following. Essentially, this election will decide whether the current policies will continue or not, for the implementation of our strategic plans depends directly on the composition of the parliament after December 2. These strategic plans include the formation of an effectively functioning civil society and development of an effective state able to ensure security and a decent life for our people. They also include the development of free and socially responsible enterprise, the fight against corruption and terrorism, modernisation of the armed forces and law enforcement agencies, and finally, a much more influential role for Russia in world affairs. This year will be the first time that the State Duma elections will take place according to the proportional system. In other words, only political parties will take part in the election. The parties’ lists of candidates will be divided into regional groups so that voters will know exactly who is competing to represent their interests in parliament. This amounts to a revolutionary change and it was a conscious choice that we made in order to achieve real democratisation of the electoral system. It needs to be said frankly that the old system of single-seat electoral districts did not stop influential regional organisations from pushing through their ‘own’ candidates, making use of the administrative resource at their disposal. We have still not overcome this problem, but the new system does considerably reduce the possibilities for using such methods. Practice shows that the proportional system gives the opposition greater opportunities to expand its representation in the legislative assemblies. This is easily proven through examples, or through statistics, to be more precise. In the three years that this system has been used at regional level, the number of party factions in local parliaments has increased almost four-fold. Today they account for almost two thirds of all members of the regional parliaments. Moreover, the abolition of the minimum voter-turnout requirement (the subject of much debate, you will recall) has not led to a decrease in political activeness, and indeed, voter turnout has been even higher than in previous election campaigns. I am certain that the new election rules will not only strengthen the role of political parties in forming a democratic system of power, but will also encourage greater competition between the different parties. This in turn will strengthen and improve the quality of Russia’s political system. Based on the outcome of the elections, the political parties will be entitled to state financing. Russia’s taxpayers have the right to rest assured that their money will not be spent on empty populist promises or on undermining the foundations of our state system. To be frank, our policy of stable and gradual development is not to everyone’s taste. Some, making skilful use of pseudo-democratic rhetoric, would like to return us to the recent past, some in order to once again plunder the nation’s resources with impunity and rob the people and the state, and others in order to deprive our country of its economic and political independence. There has been an increasing influx of money from abroad being used to intervene directly in our internal affairs. Looking back at the more distant past, we recall the talk about the civilising role of colonial powers during the colonial era. Today, ‘civilisation’ has been replaced by democratisation, but the aim is the same – to ensure unilateral gains and one’s own advantage, and to pursue one’s own interests. Some are not above using the dirtiest techniques, attempting to ignite inter-ethnic and inter-religious hatred in our multiethnic and democratic country. In this respect, I ask you to speed up the adoption of amendments to the law introducing stricter liability for extremist actions. Greater powers for regional and local authorities constitute one of the main criteria for measuring a society’s degree of political culture and development. Decentralisation of state power in Russia is now at a higher point today than at any other time in our country’s history. In the last year alone, important powers in the areas of urban development, forestry management, land and water relations, wildlife protection, and employment, have been transferred to the regional authorities. Starting next year, the regional authorities will begin exercising powers with regard to the protection and management of historical and cultural monuments of federal significance. Much has also been said about the need to strengthen the links between the upper house of the parliament and the country’s regions. I know that the Federation Council’s current members take their responsibilities very seriously indeed and consistently uphold the regions’ interests in their practical work. At the same time, many of those gathered here today propose passing a law that would allow a region to be represented only by someone who has lived there for at least ten years. I agree with this proposal but only on condition that this change will be introduced gradually, in accordance with the current procedures for rotation of the members of the Federation Council. We do not need any new revolutions. Last year was the first year during which the new law on local self-government was in force. This law considerably expands the powers and possibilities of the local authorities. Overall, I consider it necessary to continue the work to consolidate the economic foundation for local self-government, above all through ensuring the formation of a sufficient revenue base. All of this, of course, does not mean the federal authorities will no longer take responsibility for the quality of life in the regions. But it is important that the power system become more flexible and closer to the people, and that more and more decisions are taken locally. At the same time, all of us without exception, at every level of power, are responsible before the public. I draw your attention to the fact that the federal budget will allocate the regional authorities 153 billion roubles this year so that they can exercise the powers transferred to them. Next year, the money allocated for this purpose will increase to 200 billion roubles. Overall, the regions’ budgets have increased six-fold over the last seven years. We will look later at the priorities for how this money is spent, but the possibilities are considerably greater today than they were before. But along with the transfer of powers and financial resources to the regions, we must also develop an objective system for evaluating the effectiveness of the regional and municipal authorities’ work. The rapid expansion of our national information and media space is also having a beneficial effect on the development of democratic institutions and procedures. The last four years have seen a 40-percent increase in the number of registered print media, and an almost 2.5-fold increase in the number of electronic media outlets. But the leader for growth is without question the Internet. The number of Russians regularly using the Internet has increased more then four-fold over this period and now exceeds 25 million people. It is impossible to imagine the democratic political process without the participation of non-governmental organisations, without taking into account their views and opinions. This exchange of views, this dialogue with the NGOs, is developing consistently today, including through the Public Council’s constructive assistance. The professional influence and the openness of the Council’s members have given NGOs greater influence on lawmaking work, on the activities of the Government and the Federal Assembly, and also on the administrative practices of the state ministries and agencies. The Public Council has become involved in combating xenophobia and cases of bullying and abuse in the armed forces. It is making an important contribution to strengthening legality and protecting human rights. State support for public organisations is also on the increase. Last year, state support totalled 500 million roubles, while this year it will be 2.5 times higher. The number of active NGOs in the country is growing, and so is their membership, the number of volunteers carrying out all kinds of socially important work. Around 8 million people in Russia are now active in NGOs. These are all real indicators that an active civil society is developing in our country. Colleagues, The protracted economic crisis the country has gone through has had severe consequences for our country’s intelligentsia, for the situation in the arts and literature, for our people’s culture and creativity. To be honest, these difficulties have all but led to the disappearance of many of our spiritual and moral traditions. And yet, the absence of cultural beacons of our own, and blindly copying foreign models, will inevitably lead to us losing our national identity. As Dmitry Likhachev wrote, “State sovereignty is also defined by cultural criteria”. Having a unique cultural and spiritual identity has never stopped anyone from building a country open to the world. Russia has made a tremendous contribution to the formation of European and world culture. Our country has historically developed as a union of many peoples and cultures and the idea of a common community, a community in which people of different nationalities and religions live together, has been at the foundation of the Russian people’s spiritual outlook for many centuries now. This year, Russian Language Year, is a good time for us to remember once again that Russian is the language of a historical fraternity of peoples, a true language of international communication. The Russian language not only preserves an entire layer of truly global achievements but is also the living space for the many millions of people in the Russian-speaking world, a community that goes far beyond Russia itself. As the common heritage of many peoples, the Russian language will never become the language of hatred or enmity, xenophobia or isolationism. In my view, we need to support the initiative put forward by Russian linguists to create a National Russian Language Foundation, the main aim of which will be to develop the Russian language at home, support Russian language study programmes abroad and generally promote Russian language and literature around the world. Looking after the Russian language and expanding the influence of Russian culture are crucial social and political issues. Genuine art has a serious educational mission, helps to forge patriotic spirit, promotes moral and family values, respect for work and respect for one’s elders. We have already introduced a system of grants for a number of musical, theatrical and other creative groups. This has helped to stabilise the material situation in the arts community. We will take this positive experience into account in our future work. I believe that not only the state but also the business community can do much to contribute to the revival of Russian cinema and theatre, publishing and literature. And of course, it is also vitally important today to help develop the national cultures of our country’s different peoples, including through support for folklore groups. Turning to another very important matter, our country developed at one time a library system that was unique in the world, but we are forced to recognise that many years of financing shortages have led to its decline. We now need to rebuild this library system on a new and modern basis. I have already made a decision to establish a Presidential Library, which will become an information link binding the entire national library system together. This part of the library development project will be completed by the end of next year. I propose that this library be given the name of Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin, Russia’s First President. The next stage is to use regional libraries as a base for developing regional branches of the Presidential Library. They will be linked together into an information network using common methodological and software programmes.I ask the regional and municipal authorities to ensure this work to develop local information and library networks and strengthen the material and financial base for libraries, including school libraries. Libraries should be not just the storage centres for books, but genuine information, cultural and leisure centres. Carrying out these tasks I have named will require the adoption of a relevant programme and the allocation of funds. I think that support for this project from the Russian Academy of Sciences would also be helpful and timely. Cooperation with the world’s major library centres is another possibility. Our specialists have already held a series of consultations with colleagues from leading libraries in other countries. In the future, this work could eventually lead to the creation of a global library based on digital technology, which would serve as the base for an ambitious international humanitarian project to preserve the cultures and histories of the world’s peoples. I discussed this subject just recently with U.S. President George W. Bush, and we agreed that a project of this kind deserves political support at the highest level. Colleagues,No matter what the tasks we are resolving, be they in the cultural, economic or social spheres, we must look for the most effective solutions and methods. We began implementing the priority national projects 18 months ago. The primary aim of these projects is to invest in people and improve their quality of life. We realised right from the beginning that work on these projects required a particularly carefully tailored management system. At the same time, financing for the national projects was to come to no more than 5–10 percent of total budget spending on the corresponding sectors. The first year of the projects’ implementation has shown that we have succeeded in focusing budget spending on the final result. A whole number of programmes, especially in housing construction and education, are being carried out as joint projects between the federal, regional and local authorities, often with the business community becoming involved as well. Another distinguishing feature of the national projects is their innovative nature. State support is going to development projects linked to the use and introduction of the most advanced technology. This includes, for example, computerisation of the country’s schools and ensuring the provision of Internet access – a programme that should be implemented already this year. This also includes providing healthcare establishments with state-of-the-art equipment, and providing financial support to universities using new teaching methods and concepts. The projects are starting to yield their first results. The Healthcare national project, for example, has brought results in the form of victories, small victories, yes, but victories nonetheless, represented by the lives of thousands of our fellow citizens. The reduction in the death rate and rise in the birth rate that we achieved in 2006 and that has continued in the first months of this year are clear evidence that we are working in the right direction. In this respect, I would like to support the initiative to declare 2008 the Year of the Family in Russia. I hope that this decision will consolidate the efforts of the state and the business community to help strengthen and support the institution of the family and basic family values. The national project in agriculture has not only proven its effectiveness but has also demonstrated the enormous potential of Russia’s agriculture sector. It has helped to develop initiative and enterprise in rural areas. The result is that we have succeeded in checking a number of negative trends for the first time in many years. Moreover, it is clear to all now that agriculture is a promising and potentially technologically advanced sector of our economy. We recently passed a law on agriculture in accordance with which a five-year development programme for the sector is to be drafted (I know how the deputies fought for this law). I ask the Government not to delay its adoption. To give another example, implementation of the national project, Affordable and Comfortable Housing for Russia’s Citizens, has considerably invigorated the construction sector in every area, from low-rise housing to complex development of entire districts and even towns. We have come to the point now when the need to adopt a long-term strategy for mass-scale housing construction for all groups of the population is high on the agenda. We also need to look at a whole range of related issues such as urban development policy, the use of energy-saving and resource-saving technology and a development strategy for the construction industry as a whole. Although the construction industry is growing at record rates (it posted annual growth of more than 15 percent last year), it still cannot keep up with the country’s fast-growing needs. The need for a long-term strategy for the industry is also underscored by the fact that even the ambitious targets set by the national project, such as bringing 80 million square metres of new housing on to the market every year by 2010, are already not enough to meet the needs of our country today. What was once considered an achievement by Soviet standards will no longer be enough to meet demand even in the medium term. We will need to bring at the very least up to 100 million – 130 million square metres of new housing on to the market each year. Ideally, we would need to build at least one square metre of housing per capita every year. While expanding the construction of new housing, we must also not forget about the importance of maintaining existing housing in a decent state. This was a subject we discussed in detail at the State Council Presidium meeting in Kazan. The new Housing Code makes owners fully responsible for the maintenance of their property, but the chronic financing shortages for maintaining housing stock over previous decades makes this too great a burden for the overwhelming majority of new property owners, people who have become property owners after privatising their apartments and who simply do not have the means to carry out this work. Judge for yourselves: of the 3 billion square metres of housing stock in the country, more than half is in need of repair. Some buildings have not only not had any repair work done over the last 15 years, but have not seen repairs in the last 40–50 years. This explains why we are seeing an increase in the amount of dilapidated housing, which now accounts for a total of 93 million square metres, more than 11 million square metres of which – 11.2 million square metres to be precise — is in a state unfit for habitation. The scale of the problem is disastrous, without any exaggeration. There is no other word for it. The red tape involved in organising condominiums, the excessive tax burden they have to bear, and also the excessive burden of repair work are all acting as a brake on putting in place effective mechanisms to reform the housing and municipal services sector. If we wish to move ahead we therefore must find additional sources of financing, at the very least for repairs, and for resolving an issue we cannot delay – that of moving people out of housing that is no longer fit for habitation. It would be amoral for the state to ignore these problems. A country with such big reserves built up through oil and gas revenues cannot accept to see millions of its citizens living in slums. The Government has planned to allocate only 1 billion roubles on moving people out of old and dilapidated housing in 2007. I remember that when we began working on this issue back in 2004, I think it was, only 300 million roubles were allocated, and then the figure rose to 1 billion, and this year it is again 1 billion. The local authorities are spending little more on this, although this is their direct responsibility. Now I would like to come back to what I mentioned earlier, namely that there has been a six-fold increase in the [regional] budgets. I believe that sufficient financing for repairs should be allocated, but as a one-off procedure, in order to launch the mechanism for creating effective property owners’ cooperatives. As for moving people out of dilapidated housing, this should become a long-term programme that would break the negative trends in this sector and help millions of our citizens resolve their housing problems. We need to look the truth in the eyes and recognise that many of our fellow citizens, who have found themselves in very difficult circumstances, are unable to resolve this issue without support from the state. You are aware, of course, that this situation is the root of many of the serious problems we face, problems such as drunkenness, the high death rate, and crime, including juvenile delinquency. Let us also not forget the problem of abandoned children. Of course, the question arises, where will the money come from? First, we have the money. Spending decisions are always just a matter of the choice of priorities at federal and regional level. Second, I have a concrete proposal, namely, to allocate considerable additional revenue to these tasks, including revenue obtained through improved tax collection, from the privatisation of state assets and also, perhaps, from the sale of assets belonging to YUKOS in payment of its debts to the state. It is my view that we should establish a special fund with at least 250 billion roubles in order to effectively reform the housing and municipal services sector. We need to allocate at least 100 billion roubles to programmes to move people out of dilapidated housing. Note that this is twenty times higher than the funding allocated in previous years. At least 150 billion roubles should be spent on repairs to the housing stock. Previously, the federal budget allocated no money for this purpose at all. Not only government officials but also representatives of the parliament and public organisations should be involved in the management of this Fund. Given the seriousness of the problem and the large amount of resources allocated, the Fund should draw up a programme for a 4–5-year period. This programme should focus on encouraging reform of the housing and municipal services sector and on providing assistance to specific individuals. I hope that the members of the national and regional parliaments will exercise reliable control over the spending of these funds, and I ask you to do so, and I also hope that the media and the public will ensure control. I stress too that nobody is relieving the regional and local authorities of their responsibilities in this area. Colleagues,In 2002, we decided to establish the Stabilisation Fund. It was necessary in order to guarantee the execution of budget spending commitments and to reduce inflationary pressure created by high oil prices on the world markets. Time has shown that this policy was correct and justified. We have consistently brought down the inflation rate and this has had a positive impact on the growth of real incomes and has contributed to our economy’s sustainable development. But the nature of the economic tasks at hand today call for adjustments to the Stabilisation Fund’s functions and structure, while continuing to pursue a conservative financial policy. In this respect, in my Budget Address, I proposed a new procedure for using the financial resources obtained through oil and gas revenues. The specific parameters of this new procedure are fixed in the Budget Code. I remind you that all oil and gas revenues will be divided into three components. First is the Reserve Fund, the purpose of which is to minimise the risks to our economy of a sharp drop in energy prices on the world markets, and also to maintain macroeconomic stability and fight inflation, which, as I said, has a direct impact on the growth of people’s real incomes. Second, part of the oil and gas revenues will go into the federal budget, primarily in order to carry out large-scale social programmes. Third, the remaining oil and gas revenue will be placed in the Fund for Future Generations. I think that the money in this Fund should be spent on raising the quality of life of our citizens and developing our economy. This Fund should help bring greater prosperity for our people both now and in the future. In this respect, it would be more correct to call it the National Prosperity Fund. I would like to look now in more detail at how we propose spending the Fund’s resources. Historically, our culture has been based on respect for the people who have raised us and set us on our road in life. A society that does not show respect for its old people has no future. But during the difficult reform years, many pensioners – the vast majority, to be honest – ended up below the poverty line, above all due to the collapse of a pension system that was not adapted to market conditions. We have no right to repeat the mistakes of the past and we must undertake every possible effort to guarantee a decent life for our pensioners in the future. At the same time, we are hearing more and more often that we will not be able to resolve the problem of providing future pensions unless we raise the retirement age. Advocates of this idea base their conclusions on calculations that show a potential deficit in the pension system over 2012–2030 due to the need to index the basic pension at rates exceeding inflation, and also as a result of the problematic demographic situation. It is my conviction that if we act in time to take all the necessary measures, there will not be any crisis in the pension system. I also believe that there is no objective need to raise the retirement age in our country in the foreseeable future, not only because this would not in itself resolve pension provision issues for once and for good, but above all because we still have considerable possibilities we can make use of to ensure that the Pension Fund is better provided for and that would cover any deficit that could arise. This takes us back to the issue of tax collection and to bringing wages out into the open, and I ask the Government to take the appropriate measures in this respect. We also need to create a system of incentives so that people who have reached retirement age can, if they wish, voluntarily continue to work. Allowing people to voluntarily continue to work should, in the future, lead to a considerable increase in pension payments. I think that pensions should increase on average by at least 65 percent over 2007–2009. I also propose that we settle the issue of the so-called ‘Far North’ pensions, so that pensioners – both those who have already resettled from the Far North regions and regions with a similar status, and those who will do so in the future – can keep the greater part of the pensions they previously received. A decision on this matter should be made this year and I ask the Government to do this. As well as indexing pensions, we must also provide incentives for voluntary retirement savings programmes – a very important aspect of pension schemes. In this respect, I propose that some of the money from the National Prosperity Fund be spent on co-financing voluntary retirement savings programmes. What we must do, in essence, is to develop our citizens’ ‘pension capital’. I propose the following scheme: for every 1,000 roubles a person makes in voluntary contributions, the state should add another 1,000 roubles to his personal pension account in the Pension Fund. Of course, so as to ensure that these contributions do not lose their value over time, they should be reliably and profitably invested. I ask the Government to define the maximum amount of this kind of co-financing in order to ensure a fair distribution of funds among the different social groups. In the future, available funds from the National Prosperity Fund could be used to cover an eventual deficit in the pension system if it were to come about. The Fund’s financial resources should be increased to levels that would make it possible to meet the set objectives through the revenue obtained by their effective investment. I will not name any specific figures now – the Government will get nervous if I name them, but it knows what kind of amounts we are talking about. I ask you to ensure that this does not remain just empty words. Together, these measures I have mentioned should ensure that our citizens’ retirement provisions increase and should also guarantee the pension system’s reliable functioning in the long-term perspective. Colleagues, Russia’s rich educational, scientific and creative heritage gives our country clear advantages for creating a competitive economy based on knowledge and intellect, an economy driven not by the rate at which natural resources are exploited, but above all by the ability to come up with new ideas and inventions and introduce them more rapidly than others into everyday life. We have prepared the conditions for implementing precisely this strategy. We have passed the necessary laws and established the necessary structures. Now, using the base we have laid, we must begin setting concrete objectives. In this respect, I want to come back to the question of making use of the National Prosperity Fund. Part of the Fund’s money should be spent on capitalising development institutions, above all the Development Bank, the Investment Fund, the Russian Venture Company and others. For this purpose I propose that 300 billion roubles be allocated this year with further allocations for this work in the years to come. Regarding the projects financed by the development institutions, I think they should be devoted to resolving the biggest tasks our economy faces. First is to remove infrastructure bottlenecks that hinder growth.Second is to make use of natural resources more effective.Third is to modernise and develop high-technology industrial production. I also note one point of principle importance, and that is that budget funds should not become the main source of funding but should above all serve as a catalyst for private investment. The state’s aim in putting budget funds into the economy should be only to provide a shoulder to lean on in areas where the risks for private investors are still too high. The state’s main role should be to help business create a new and genuinely modern production base and encourage the emergence of an increasing number of national public companies.I also want to mention the importance of small business as an economic sector. We have spoken on many occasions of the need to develop small business, and I ask you to pass at the earliest possible date a law on the support and development of small business. I can say with all certainty that where small business is developing well, there is less poverty and the death rate is lower. The statistics confirm this. As small business continues to develop, the structure of our society will change and the middle class will grow. The parasite mentality will fade away and a spirit of initiative will develop as our citizens come to take ever greater responsibility for the results of their labour. Concerning state funds, we should keep in mind that federal, regional and local investment already accounts for around 20 percent of all investment in the country. We must ensure that this investment is used as effectively as possible. The taxpayers have a right to demand that this money bring the expected results. We also need to bring order to the system for concluding state contracts. We need to move over entirely to a system of contracts in which the cost of state procurement orders does not change throughout the contract’s execution. In the vast majority of cases, the allocation of state procurement orders should be conducted through a system of auctions. Now I would like to speak in more detail about the specific projects we propose. These are ambitious and large-scale projects. One of our clear priorities over the coming years is electricity production. Russia has already run up against a shortage of capacity for future growth. We plan to carry out the biggest structural reform project this sector has seen in decades. In essence, our project amounts to a second electrification of the country. We need to increase electricity production by two thirds by 2020. The state and private companies will invest around 12 trillion roubles in this work. We will build new electricity stations and modernise existing stations, and we will also expand the network infrastructure. We also need to change considerably the structure of our electricity production by increasing the share of nuclear, coal-based and hydroelectricity production. Over the entire Soviet period, 30 nuclear power plant units were built, but we plan to build 26 such units over the next 12 years, and to do so using the most advanced technology available. I propose establishing a special corporation to carry out this project, a corporation that would bring together nuclear energy and industrial companies. This corporation will work on the domestic and foreign markets and will also take part in ensuring the state’s defence interests. This will require a special law to be adopted. This is the nuclear energy industry I am talking about here. Russia also has immense hydroelectricity production potential, but it is making less than 20 percent use of this huge potential, while other developed countries are making 70–80 percent use of their hydroelectricity production resources. We must begin building major new hydroelectric stations, above all in Siberia and the Far East. We also possess enormous coal reserves, and we should therefore focus also on increasing the share of new generation coal-based production in our electricity production structure. I hope that the Government’s active work and initiative from the business community will enable us to successfully implement these electricity production development plans. Yet another element in the infrastructure for future growth is an effective transport system. Poor and at times completely inexistent roads severely hamper development. Annual economic losses due to the poor state of our roads are estimated at more than 3 percent of GDP. Just think that we spend 2.7 percent of our GDP on defence each year. The mobility of Russia’s population is almost 2.5 times lower than in other developed countries. You will agree, I am sure, that we can no longer accept to see the decrepit bridge crossings, construction of which began during the Soviet years, or calmly read the tragic figures for the number of road accidents, including fatal accidents, on busy highways such as the Moscow-Don road, for example, used by millions of people, especially in the summer. All of this is absolutely unacceptable. Federal spending on roads has practically doubled since 2005, but given the urgency of the problems I have mentioned and the need to develop the road networks within cities too, I propose that an additional 100 billion roubles be allocated. Overall, I believe that we need to approve a programme for developing the road network through to 2015. The construction of high-quality federal highways and the reconstruction of the roads that form the international north-south and centre-Urals transport corridors in the European part of Russia are definite priorities. Also a priority is work to develop the infrastructure needed to help the Far East and Siberia realise their economic potential. I believe that simply increasing funding is not enough, of course. We need to put in place a legal base that would provide for new and modern methods of financing and the construction and operation of roads. The members of the State Duma and the Government have already put forward the relevant legislative initiatives. We need to act now to implement them as soon as possible. Developing the country’s rail, air and water transport links is just as important a task.We need to adopt a long-term programme for developing our railways, in terms of both domestic and international traffic. The number of airports in Russia has dropped three-fold over the last 15 years. We need to take urgent measures to improve the situation in this area and to begin implementation of a programme to establish aviation transit hubs. I believe that only the most important airports should remain federal property, while the rest should be transferred to the country’s regions. I ask the Government to examine the adoption of a special programme for developing the airport network. We need to raise private investment too, through the privatisation of airport terminals and the concession of airport infrastructure, including runways. I have been talking about the need to develop our sea ports for several years now. But the situation has barely improved at all. Our freight traffic continues to go through foreign ports and this is quite simply unacceptable. The Government, as if on purpose, is not taking any measures. And yet we have been discussing this matter for several years now! I think that this situation results from either an inability to properly set the priorities I have spoken of on several occasions now, or an inability to properly organise the practical work. Both cases are equally bad. Now we must take urgent steps. First of all, we need to draft and adopt investment programmes for developing Russia’s ports. This year, we will settle the issue of allocating land resources for the development of port infrastructure. Finally, we also need to pass the corresponding law and make the decisions regarding the establishment of a number of free port zones offering tax incentives. The development of river transport can play a big part in bringing down costs in the economy. We need to carry out projects to increase the throughput capacity of our internal waterways, including through modernising the Volga-Don and Volga-Baltic canals. I propose that the Government also examine the establishment of an international consortium to build a second section of the Volga-Don canal. This new transport artery would have a significant impact on improving shipping links between the Caspian and the Black Seas. Not only would this give the Caspian Sea countries a route to the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, thus providing them with access to the world’s oceans, it would also radically change their geopolitical situation by enabling them to become sea powers. I have already held preliminary talks on this issue with my colleagues from the countries bordering the Caspian.For Russia, this would be another large-scale and economically advantageous infrastructure project. Another question future generations will have the right to ask us regards the use of our country’s natural resources. Are we really gaining maximum benefit from our natural resources? This question applies not only to oil, gas, and mineral resources, but also to our forestry and water resources. Many of you probably do not know that Russia was the world’s biggest oil producer in 2006, but that we lag behind considerably when it comes to oil refining. The Government needs to draw up a system of measures to encourage the development of refining capacity within the country. Yet another problem is that Russian oil fields burn more than 20 billion cubic metres of accompanying gas every year, and that is the minimum estimate. And yet, elsewhere in the world, there is a whole system of measures that has already proven its effectiveness. We must act urgently to establish the relevant accounting system, increase fines for environmental damage, and also toughen licence demands for natural resource users. Turning to the next issue, the Government has already made a decision to gradually raise export duties on round wood. We do not seek to damage the interests of our foreign partners, but we must work on developing our own wood processing industry. This includes further justified steps to bring down import duties on technical equipment, speeding up the provision of forest tracts and using co-financing programmes to create the necessary infrastructure. We have been discussing the problems of another sector, the fisheries sector, increasingly frequently of late. No visible progress has been made yet in this sector, and yet the priority decisions are obvious and very clear. Most countries have traditionally kept their fisheries closed to foreigners. We should stop allocating quotas to foreign companies and give preference to Russian companies that develop their own processing activities. I also ask the Government to draw up a system of measures for ensuring effective customs control and prevention of poaching and smuggling. I would like to look now at the sectors that will play an important part in developing an innovation-based economy. Russia has historically been a leader in aircraft manufacturing, both military and civilian. Over the last decade, however, we have seen our civilian aircraft manufacturing industry decline. We have adopted a programme to develop this sector and have established the United Aircraft Manufacturing Corporation. This new aircraft manufacturing corporation should become an engine for modernising the entire sector. Ultimately, Russia will develop a modern aircraft manufacturing sector producing the main different types of civilian aircraft. This year, we need to choose an international partner for mutually beneficial cooperation, while continuing to implement the projects already begun. Russia is also a major sea power. We have a fairly well developed sea traffic market , but we have practically stopped building civilian vessels. Over the last decade, our ship owners have placed orders for more than 90 percent of their new vessels with foreign shipyards. If we do not take action now, the shipbuilding sector in our country will go into decline and this will ultimately have a negative impact also on our country’s security, on military shipbuilding. In order to rectify this situation, we have decided to establish the United Shipbuilding Corporation, which will work in all segments of the market, from designing and building ships to carrying out maintenance and repair work. The corporation’s mission is to win itself a decent niche on the global shipbuilding market. This is a goal within our reach. I expect us to decide very soon on state support measures for the shipbuilding sector in Russia. We cannot modernise our economy without also developing science in our country.Last year, a federal law was passed which will see scientific work in state academies take place based on a five-year programme for fundamental research. This programme will be approved by the Government based on proposals made by the Russian Academy of Sciences and other state institutions. A total of 48 billion roubles will be allocated to this fundamental research programme in 2008 and another 8 billion roubles will be allocated to funds supporting fundamental research. I ask that provisions be made to increase these allocations in the future. Special targeted programmes introducing open tenders for state orders for applied scientific research and development constitute another source of funding. Based on the results of these tenders, contracts will be signed with individual scientific organisations and teams. This will also help to encourage the competitive spirit that is essential in science. This thus gives us two sources of financing – through the Academy of Sciences and other institutions, and directly to the scientific centres through open tenders. The targeted programmes represent a total of more than 33 billion roubles in funds for 2008, and this is in addition to the financing through the Academy of Sciences. I also propose that we introduce the practice of holding tenders for development programmes for scientific research institutes, similar to the system of tenders for developing innovation in universities we began using last year. We have the task now of developing our science and technology potential and ensuring it is up to the challenges of global technological development. In this respect, I particularly want to stress the need to establish an effective system of research and development in the area of nanotechnology based on atomic and molecular constructions. For most people today, nanotechnology is as abstract a concept as was nuclear technology back in the 1930s. But nanotechnology is already a key direction in the development of modern industry and science. In the long term, nanotechnology will provide a foundation for raising living standards, strengthening national security and supporting high economic growth rates. Scientists predict that goods making use of nanotechnology will become a part of our everyday lives, and that they will help us to conserve non-renewable natural resources. I recently approved a development strategy for the nanotechnology industry, setting out the main priorities and the legal and organisational mechanisms for creating the infrastructure in this sector. This infrastructure will encompass state scientific centres and universities and also private corporations’ laboratories. The state must make available the necessary resources for the material, technical, personnel and organisational implementation of this work. These funds will be managed by the specially established Russian Nanotechnology Corporation. These funds total at least 130 billion roubles. I ask that you complete the drafting and adoption of the corresponding federal law as soon as possible. I call on you, colleagues, to please do this as swiftly as you can. In total, taking into account the federal targeted programmes, the federal budget will allocate around 180 billion roubles to this work. I draw your attention to the fact that this new area of work will receive funding comparable to the funding we give to science in general, almost the same amount!The main question is that of putting in place the conditions for increasing private investment in nanotechnology development. I hope to see intensive joint work by the Government, the state organisations being formed, and private companies, to carry out specific projects, including in aircraft manufacturing and shipbuilding and in the rocket and space industry, nuclear energy, medical technology and the housing and municipal services sector. Given the scale and unique nature of the nanotechnology project, I think we could propose that the CIS countries also become involved. This could be yet another forward-looking and mutually beneficial project that brings us closer together. Regarding the nanotechnology corporation, I think that its directors should include representatives of both houses of the Federal Assembly. Colleagues,We must continue our work to strengthen the country’s armed forces. Our military reform and development programmes have already brought about significant changes, and this is in large part thanks to the consolidated position of the main political groups and the coordinated work of the executive and legislative branches of power. The implementation of the federal targeted programme, Transition to Contract-based Service in a Number of Military Units, has led to two thirds of armed forces units now being manned by contract servicemen. The length of compulsory military service will be reduced to 12 months starting in January 2008. We will carry out this task. The re-equipment of military units with new and modernised arms and equipment, which will form the basis of the arms programme through to 2020, is going according to plan. We have begun implementing the State Arms Programme for 2007–2015. The bulk of the spending under this programme will go on series procurement of new arms and military equipment. In order to use these funds effectively, contracts will be concluded by a new specially set-up federal agency. The security agencies will all delegate to this new agency their functions for placing procurement orders and paying contracts. One of the most important indicators of the state of the armed forces is the situation with the social protection system for servicemen and their families. Two 15-percent wage increases are planned for servicemen, one in December this year, and one in September 2008. These increases will have a direct impact on military pensions too. Increases to military pensions depend on the level of wages of current servicemen. Yet another matter: last year, more than 40,000 apartments were made available for servicemen and armed forces veterans. By 2010, we should have fully resolved the problem of providing all servicemen and veterans with permanent housing, and by the end of 2012, we should have completed construction of service housing stock. We also need to take additional measures to encourage housing construction for servicemen in the Far East. I say again that we must work consistently to keep strengthening our armed forces, keeping our objectives in this area commensurate with our economic possibilities and with the nature of potential threats and the changes in the international situation. This brings me to the following matter. As you know, the Warsaw Pact countries and NATO signed the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty in 1990. This treaty would have made sense if the Warsaw Pact had continued to exist. But today all that this treaty means is that we face restrictions on deploying conventional forces on our own territory. It is difficult to imagine a situation where the United States, for example, would accept restrictions on such a basis on the deployment of troops on its own territory. However, not only did Russia sign and ratify this treaty, but it has also observed its provisions in practice. We have carried out considerable troop reductions. We no longer have any groups in the northwest of army or corps size. Practically all types of heavy arms have been withdrawn from the European part of the country. We are essentially the only country facing so-called ‘flank restrictions’ in the south and north. Even when the situation flared up in Chechnya, Russia continued to observe its commitments under this treaty and coordinated its action with its partners. But what about our partners? They have not even ratified the adapted treaty, citing the Istanbul Agreements providing for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Georgia and Trans-Dniester. But our country has been working consistently towards resolving these complex tasks. More importantly, the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty is not in any way legally bound to the Istanbul Agreements. This makes us fully justified in saying that in this particular case, our partners are not displaying correct behaviour, to say the least, in their attempts to gain unilateral advantages. While making use of an invented pretext for not ratifying the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty, they are taking advantage of the situation to build up their own system of military bases along our borders. Furthermore, they plan to deploy elements of a missile defence system in the Czech Republic and Poland. New NATO members such as Slovenia and the Baltic states, despite the preliminary agreements reached with NATO, have not signed the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty at all. This creates a real threat and an unpredictable situation for Russia. In this context, I believe that the right course of action is for Russia to declare a moratorium on its observance of this treaty until such time as all NATO members without exception ratify it and start strictly observing its provisions, as Russia has been doing so far on a unilateral basis. It is time for our partners to also make their contribution to arms reductions, not just in word but in deed. At the moment, they are only increasing arms, but it is time for them to start making cutbacks, if only in Europe. I propose that we discuss this problem at the Russia-NATO Council. If no progress can be made through negotiations, then I propose that we examine the possibility of suspending our commitments under the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty (Applause). I was about to say that I call on the Federal Assembly to support this proposal, but I understand from your reaction that you do support it. I also call your attention to the fact that elements of U.S. strategic weapons systems could be deployed in Europe for the first time. It is clear that the U.S. plans to deploy a missile defence system in Europe is not just an issue for bilateral Russian-American relations. This issue, in one way or another, affects the interests of all European countries, including those in NATO. In this respect, this subject should be, and I would even say must be, discussed in the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe as part of this organisation’s political and military dimension. It is time for us to give the OSCE real substance and have it address the issues of genuine concern to the peoples of Europe rather than just hunting for fleas in the post-Soviet area.Incidentally, we support the candidacy of Kazakhstan for the presidency of this organisation and we hope that Kazakhstan’s presidency would help to give the organisation the needed positive boost to its work. Colleagues,Our foreign policy is aimed at joint, pragmatic, and non-ideological work to resolve the important problems we face. In broader terms, what I am speaking about is a culture of international relations based on international law – without attempts to impose development models or to force the natural pace of the historical process. This makes the democratisation of international life and a new ethic in relations between states and peoples particularly important. It also calls for the expansion of economic and humanitarian cooperation between countries. This explains the attention we must pay to building up the common humanitarian space within the CIS, making our work with Russians abroad more effective, and making greater use of cooperation between civil society organisations that has proved its worth. Youth, education, cultural and professional exchanges are all an important part of humanitarian cooperation. As it rebuilds its economic potential and becomes more aware of its possibilities, today’s Russia seeks to develop equal relations with all countries avoiding any attitude of arrogance. We will do no more than defend our economic interests and make use of our competitive advantages in the way that all countries around the world do. We support the development of institutions and mechanisms that give equal consideration to the interests of all partners. This is true for projects in all fields – in the energy sector, in industry, and in the area of international transit. These projects exist and are being implemented. Russia will continue to show initiative in pursuing economic integration in the CIS area and, more broadly, throughout the Eurasian region. We need to bolster the integration processes taking place in the Eurasian Economic Community and in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. This, I stress, is precisely a case where economic development is synonymous with security, including the security of our borders. I would like to reiterate our approach to building the Union State between Russia and Belarus. Russia is open to all forms and models of integration. We are prepared to go as far in this respect as our Belarusian friends are ready to go. The pace at which we build the Union State depends only on the substance and the real depth of the integration processes underway. We are not hurrying anyone. We are ready to hold frank discussions with our partners on any of the problems that arise on the way. But we remain unswervingly committed to our policy of comprehensive development of relations with Belarus in vital areas such as the economy, transport, social protection, healthcare and humanitarian cooperation. Whatever the case, we will act in keeping with the interests of the peoples of both Russia and Belarus. I note also that we are developing an increasingly constructive partnership with the European Union. We believe that all of these positive elements in our relations should now be cemented and developed in the new basic strategic partnership agreement between Russia and the EU. Overall, we need to conduct a serious discussion involving the politicians and members of the business and academic communities on ways to facilitate the free movement of capital, goods, services and labour on the European and Asian continents. Russia, with its geopolitical position, can and will play an important part in this respect and will do all it can to encourage these processes. I propose that we begin this discussion at the International Economic Forum in June 2007 in St Petersburg. In conclusion, I would like to make a small and almost lyrical digression from the purely businesslike format of this Address. My presidential term comes to an end in the spring of 2008 and the next Address to the Federal Assembly will be delivered by the next head of state. In this respect, of course, many of you expected that today’s Address would concentrate mostly on summing up and evaluating what we have accomplished in our work together since 2000. You expected to hear, no doubt, some philosophical recommendations for the future. But I think that it is not proper for us to evaluate our own work, and not time yet for me to set out my political testament. Of course, we should always be thinking about the future. Here in Russia we have this old tradition, a favourite pastime, of searching for a national idea. This is something akin to looking for the meaning of life. It is, generally speaking, a useful and interesting pursuit, and also one that is never-ending. Let us not launch into discussions on such matters today. But I think that many of you will agree with me that in working towards the goals we have set, making use of everything new, modern and innovative in doing so, we must and we also will rest our endeavours upon the moral values that our people have forged over the more than 1,000 years of their history. Only in this case will we be able to set the right course of development for our country, and only in this case will we achieve success. No matter what times we have lived through, be it revolutionary upheavals or the stagnation years, we have almost always yearned for change. True, each of us has our own idea of what kind of change we need, our own priorities, our own preferences and dislikes, and our own vision of the past, present and future. This is natural and understandable, for we are all different. But there is also something that unites us all without exception: we all want things to change for the better. But we do not all know how to achieve this. You and I, all of us present here at the Kremlin today, are not only duty-bound to know how to achieve this, but are duty-bound to do everything possible to come up with plans for practical, concrete action. We must do everything we can to convince the majority of our citizens that these plans are effective and to genuinely involve them in this constructive process. I would like to note in this respect that each of my eight Addresses to the Federal Assembly has not only evaluated the situation in the country and its place in the world, but has also set priorities, including long-term priorities in the social sphere, in the economy, in foreign and domestic policy, and in defence and security. Though perhaps not complete, this constitutes in effect a fairly concrete and substantial conceptual programme for Russia’s development. Its implementation requires constructive work from all sections of society and calls for immense effort and huge financial resources. It is my conviction that our country will take its deserved place in the world, and we will be able to preserve our statehood and our sovereignty, only when our citizens see and feel for themselves and are confident that all of the state’s endeavours aim at protecting their vital interests, at improving their lives and bringing them greater prosperity and security. Only when our people are able to feel proud of their country. Each citizen should feel that he is a part of the nation, involved in its fate. And each citizen should be able to improve his own life through lawful means and add to our nation’s wealth through his labour. All of us who are involved in administrative, public, and all the more so political work, bear particular responsibility. This applies fully to everyone present here today, to the Russian Government, the federal ministers, the regional governors, the members of both houses of parliament, the judges, to the representatives of all the branches of power. We must make the utmost effort and give all our strength to the very last minute of our lawful constitutional mandates and use effectively the time that destiny has given us to serve Russia.Thank you.",2007
"MoscowPresident Vladimir Putin: Distinguished members of the Federal Assembly,Citizens of Russia,The addresses of the last years have set out our main socio-economic policy priorities for the coming decade. Our efforts today focus precisely on the areas that directly determine the quality of life for our citizens. We are carrying out national projects in the areas of healthcare, education, agriculture and housing construction. As you know, the problems in these areas have accumulated not just over a period of years but over entire decades. These are very sensitive issues for people’s lives. We have had to build up considerable strength and resources in order to finally be able to address these problems and focus our efforts on resolving them.A number of laws were passed in order to implement the proposals set out in the Annual Address for last year (2005). These were laws designed to improve our political system, in particular, the law on the Public Chamber, the law on parliamentary investigations and the law giving the party winning the majority in regional elections the right to take part in the process of selecting the regional governor. We likewise adopted a decision that improves relations between the federal, regional and local authorities. In other words, we have concentrated over these last years on ironing out the imbalances that had arisen in our system of state organisation and in the social sphere. Now, as we plan the continued development of our state and political system, we must also take into account the current situation in society. In this respect I note what has become a characteristic feature of our country’s political life, namely, low levels of public trust in some of the institutions of state power and in big business. The reasons for this situation are understandable. The changes of the early 1990s were a time of great hopes for millions of people, but neither the authorities nor business fulfilled these hopes. Moreover, some members of these groups pursued their own personal enrichment in a way such as had never been seen before in our country’s history, at the expense of the majority of our citizens and in disregard for the norms of law and morality.“In the working out of a great national program which seeks the primary good of the greater number, it is true that the toes of some people are being stepped on and are going to be stepped on. But these toes belong to the comparative few who seek to retain or to gain position or riches or both by some short cut which is harmful to the greater good.”These are fine words and it is a pity that it was not I who thought them up. It was Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the President of the United States of America, in 1934. These words were spoken as the country was emerging from the great depression. Many countries have faced similar problems, just as we are today, and many have found worthy ways to overcome them. At the foundation of these solutions was a clear understanding that the state’s authority should not be based on excessive permissiveness, but on the ability to pass just and fair laws and firmly ensure their enforcement. We will continue, of course, to work on raising the prestige of the civil service, and we will continue to support Russian business. But be it a businessman with a billion-dollar fortune or a civil servant of any rank, they all must know that the state will not turn a blind eye to their doings if they attempt to gain illegal profit out of creating special relations with each other. I make this point now because, despite all the efforts we have made, we have still not yet managed to remove one of the greatest obstacles facing our development, that of corruption. It is my view that social responsibility must lie at the foundation of the work of civil servants and business, and they must understand that the source of Russia’s wellbeing and prosperity is the people of this country. It is the state’s duty to ensure that this principle is reflected in deed and not just in word. I believe that this is one of the priority tasks we face today and that we cannot resolve this task unless we ensure the rights and liberties of our citizens, organise the state itself effectively and develop democracy and civil society. We have spoken on many occasions of the need to achieve high economic growth as an absolute priority for our country. The annual address for 2003 set for the first time the goal of doubling gross domestic product within a decade. The calculation is not hard to make: to achieve this goal our economy needs to grow at a rate of just over seven percent a year. On the surface we look to be keeping to our objectives and have had average economic growth of around seven percent for the past three years, but I want to stress that if we do not address certain issues, do not improve our basic macroeconomic indicators, do not ensure the necessary level of economic freedom, do not create equal conditions for competition and do not strengthen property rights, we will be unlikely to achieve our stated economic goals within the set deadline. We have already begun taking concrete steps to change the structure of our economy and, as we have discussed a great deal, to give it a more innovative quality. I think that the government is moving in the right direction in this regard but I would like to make the following points. First, state investment is necessary, of course, but it is not the only means of achieving our objectives. Second, it is not the volume of investment that is important so much as an ability to choose the right priorities while at the same time ensuring that we continue following the responsible economic policy we set five years ago. After a long period during which we ran a budget deficit and faced sharp fluctuations of the rouble’s exchange rate, the situation today is changing dramatically. We must maintain this financial stability that has been achieved as one of the basic conditions for increasing people’s trust in the state and for encouraging entrepreneurs to invest money in business development. Today’s situation allows us to make a calmer and more sober assessment of the threats that Russia encounters as part of the world system, threats that represent a danger for our internal development and for our country’s international interests. We can make a more detailed examination of our place in the world economy. In a context of intensive competition, scientific and technological advantages are the defining factors for a country’s economic development. Unfortunately, a large part of the technological equipment used by Russian industry today lags not just years but decades behind the most advanced technology the world can offer. Even allowing for the climate conditions in Russia, our energy use is many times less efficient than that of our direct competitors. Yes, we know that this is the legacy of the way our economy and our industry developed during the Soviet period, but it is not enough just to know. We have to take concrete steps to change the situation. We must take serious measures to encourage investment in production infrastructure and innovative development while at the same time maintaining the financial stability we have achieved. Russia must realise its full potential in high-tech sectors such as modern energy technology, transport and communications, space and aircraft building. Our country must become a major exporter of intellectual services. Of course, we hope for increased entrepreneurial initiative in all sectors of the economy and we will ensure all the necessary conditions for this to happen. But a real leap forward in the areas that I just mentioned, all areas in which our country has traditionally been strong, gives us the opportunity to use them as an engine for growth. This is a real opportunity to change the structure of our entire economy and establish for ourselves a worthy place in the international division of labour.We already feel confident in the mining and extraction sector. Our companies in this sector are very competitive. Gazprom, for example, has just become the third biggest company in the world in terms of capitalisation, while at the same time maintaining quite low tariffs for Russian consumers. This result did not just come about all on its own, but is the result of carefully planned action by the state. But we cannot pat ourselves on the back and stop here. We need to put in place the conditions for more rapid technological modernisation in the energy sector. We need to develop modern refining and processing facilities, build up our transport capacity and develop new and promising markets. And in doing all of this we need to ensure both our own internal development needs and fulfil all of our obligations to our traditional partners. We must also take steps to develop nuclear energy, a nuclear energy sector based on safe, new-generation reactors. We need to consolidate Russia’s position on the world markets for nuclear energy sector technology and equipment and make full use here of our knowledge, experience, advanced technology, and of course, international cooperation. Restructuring in the nuclear energy industry itself also aims at enabling us to achieve these goals. We must, of course, also focus work on promising new directions in energy – hydrogen and thermonuclear energy.We must also take action to make our energy consumption radically more efficient. This demand is not just a whim for a country rich in energy resources, but is an issue for our competitiveness in the context of integration into the world economy. It is an issue of the environmental security and quality of life for our people. I believe that only in this way can we ensure that Russia maintains a leading and stable position on energy markets in the long term. And in this way, Russia will be able to play a positive part in forming a common European energy strategy. Our country has an advantageous geographical location and we must make use of this factor to realise our potential in the very promising area of modern transport and communications. The key decision in this respect is comprehensive and interlinked development of all types of transport and communications. I note in this regard that concession mechanisms create new opportunities for carrying out such projects, and we should start making use of them very soon. The reorganisation of important sectors such as aircraft- and shipbuilding has been dragging on for an unjustifiably long time. The government must take rapid steps to finally complete work on establishing holdings in these sectors. It is also extremely important for us to make the right choices in our development priorities for the space industry. We must not forget that the development of outer space is Russia’s protective shield, gives us the possibility of detecting global natural cataclysms at an early stage and is a testing ground for new materials and technology. These and other objectives all require considerable investment to modernise facilities producing equipment for the space industry and to develop the infrastructure on the ground. Russia has the potential to become one of the leaders in the field of nanotechnology. This sector represents one of the most promising directions for energy conservation and for developing new elements, medical technology and robotics. I believe we must take rapid steps to draw up and adopt an effective programme in this field. I hope too that the implementation of the government’s and the Russian Academy of Sciences’ joint plans to modernise the science sector will not be no more than a formality but will bring genuine results and provide our country’s economy with promising new scientific developments. Overall, what we need today is an innovative environment that will get new knowledge flowing. To do this we need to create the necessary infrastructure: technology incubators, technology parks, venture funds, investment funds. We are already doing this. We need to establish favourable tax conditions for financing innovative activities. I believe too that the state should also facilitate the purchase of modern technology abroad. In this respect we have also taken some steps, first of all, of course, in order to modernise priority branches of industry. In this respect I ask you to analyse the possibilities for channelling resources into the capital of the financial institutions involved in leasing, lending and providing insurance for these types of contracts. Reliable protection of intellectual property rights remains an essential condition for developing new technology. We must guarantee the protection of copyright within our country – this is also our duty to our foreign partners. And we must also ensure greater protection for the interests of Russian copyright holders abroad. Dear colleagues,Russia today needs unhindered access for its goods on international markets. We consider this an issue of more rational participation in the international division of labour and a question of making full use of the benefits offered by integration into the world economy. It is precisely for this reason that we are continuing our negotiations on accession to the World Trade Organisation based only on conditions that fully take into consideration Russia’s economic interests. It is clear today that our economy is already more open than the economies of many of the members of this esteemed organisation. The negotiations on Russia’s accession to the WTO must not become a bargaining chip on issues that have nothing to do with this organisation’s activities. In my address for 2003 I set the goal of making the rouble convertible. An outline of the steps to take was set out and I must say that these steps are being taken. I propose today that we speed up the removal of the remaining restrictions and complete this work by July 1 of this year. But making the rouble genuinely convertible depends in great part on its attractiveness as an instrument for settlements and savings. In this respect we still have a great deal of work to do. In particular, the rouble must become a more universal means for carrying out international settlements and should gradually expand its zone of influence. To this end we need to organise markets on Russian territory for trading oil, gas and other goods, markets that carry out their transactions in roubles. Our goods are traded on world markets, but why are they not traded here in Russia? The government should speed up work on settling these issues.As I said before, our growing economic possibilities have enabled us to allocate additional money to the social sphere – investment in our people’s prosperity and in Russia’s future. The goal of the Affordable Housing project, for example, is to lower interest rates on mortgage loans over a period of two years and almost triple the total mortgage loans made, bringing them to a total of 260 billion roubles. Another of our national projects allocates considerable resources to the development of agriculture. Work has already begun on programmes to build housing for young higher education graduates in rural areas. We are also developing a system for making loans available to co-operative retailers, small individual land cultivation and large-scale agricultural production enterprises. We are facilitating the purchase of the new technology and high-quality agricultural equipment that is so essential for our rural areas. Now for a few words on the aims and measures set out in the Education national project. Russia needs a competitive education system otherwise we will end up facing the real threat of having our quality of education not measure up to modern demands. Above all, we need to support the higher education establishments that are carrying out innovative programmes, including by buying the latest Russian and foreign-made equipment and technology. The government must bring order to the curriculum of vocatonal education schools. This is something that should be done through work together with the business community and social services sector, for whom these institutions are training specialists in the first place. We need to create a system of objective and independent external control over the quality of the education received, and we need to engage in broad-based and open dialogue with the public to establish an objective rating of universities. We should not be afraid to expand the financial independence of education institutions, including schools, at the same time raising their responsibility for the quality of every aspect of the learning process and for the final result. I support our business community’s initiative of financing major universities through special development funds and through the formation of an education loans system. In this respect we need to look at improving the legislation in order to create incentives for such spending and ensure the necessary guarantees. I deliberately have not used the term state guarantees, but there must be guarantees of some kind, and the government can organise this work and put in place the required mechanisms. Our fourth national project has been started in the area of healthcare and is aimed at improving primary healthcare and prevention and at improving access to high-tech medical services. I want to emphasise at the same time that the money allocated to the national projects accounts for only around 5–7 percent of total state spending in these sectors. The government and the regional and local authorities must work systematically together on modernising these four sectors and making more effective use of the considerable resources that we already have. If properly organised, all of this work should improve the quality of service in healthcare and education and also make it possible to considerably increase wages for all groups working in these sectors, not only those who are receiving additional payments as part of the priority projects. Furthermore, starting this year, a large part of the federal budget spending will be focused on the final result. The regional authorities also must begin this work. I deliberately draw the regional authorities’ attention to this point. The government has already taken the first steps in this direction but in the regions nothing is happening. We must also continue the process of devolution of powers. In particular, the regions should be given part of the investment funds from the federal budget, which are essentially already being used today to finance municipal powers. It is high time to stop overseeing the construction of schools, bathhouses and sewerage systems from Moscow. And now for the most important matter. What is most important for our country? The Defence Ministry knows what is most important. Indeed, what I want to talk about is love, women, children. I want to talk about the family, about the most acute problem facing our country today – the demographic problem. The economic and social development issues our country faces today are closely interlinked to one simple question: who we are doing this all for? You know that our country’s population is declining by an average of almost 700,000 people a year. We have raised this issue on many occasions but have for the most part done very little to address it. Resolving this problem requires us to take the following steps. First, we need to lower the death rate. Second, we need an effective migration policy. And third, we need to increase the birth rate. The government just recently adopted a programme for improving road safety. Adopting a programme is easy, now we need to implement it. I take this opportunity to draw the government’s attention to delays and unjustified red tape involved in carrying out these kinds of tasks. I spoke about this issue in last year’s address, and the programme has only just now been prepared. I am certain that other issues raised in last year’s address are also not always being resolved in the way they should be.We are taking measures to prevent the import and production of bootleg alcohol. The national Healthcare project is rightly focusing on the detection, prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease and other illnesses that are high causes of death among our population. Regarding migration policy, our priority remains to attract our compatriots from abroad. In this regard we need to encourage skilled migration to our country, encourage educated and law-abiding people to come to Russia. People coming to our country must treat our culture and national traditions with respect. But no amount of migration will resolve our demographic problems if we do not also put in place the conditions and incentives for encouraging the birth rate to rise here in our own country. We cannot resolve this problem unless we adopt effective support programmes for mothers, children and families. Even the small increase in the birth rate and the drop in infant mortality we have seen of late are not so much the result of concerted effort in this area as of the general improvement in the country’s socio-economic outlook. It is good to see this improvement, but it is not enough. The work we have carried out on social projects over these last years has laid a good base, including for resolving the demographic problem, but it is still inadmissibly insufficient, and you know why. The situation in this area is critical. Distinguished members of the Federal Assembly, you will soon begin work on the budget for 2007, the year of elections to the State Duma. Understandably, the budget adoption process will be determined in large part by your desire to do as much as you can for your voters. But if we really want to do something useful and necessary for our citizens, I propose that you lay aside political ambitions and don’t disperse resources, and that we concentrate on resolving the most vital problems the country faces, one of which is the demographic problem, or, as Solzhenitsyn put it, the issue of ‘conserving the people’ in the broad sense. All the more so as there is public consensus that we must first of all address this key problem affecting our country. I am sure that if you do this you will reap the gratitude of millions of mothers, young families and all the people of our country. What am I talking about specifically? I propose a programme to encourage childbirth. In particular, I propose measures to support young families and support women who decide to give birth and raise children. Our aim should be at the least to encourage families to have a second child. What stops young families, women, from making such a decision today, especially when we’re talking of having a second or third child? The answers are well known. They include low incomes, inadequate housing conditions, doubts as to their own ability to ensure the child a decent level of healthcare and education, and – let’s be honest – sometimes doubts as to whether they will even be able to feed the child. Women planning to have a child face the choice of either giving birth and losing their jobs, or not giving birth. This is a very difficult choice. The programme to encourage childbirth should include a whole series of administrative, financial and social support measures for young families. All of these measures are equally important but nothing will bring results unless the necessary material support is provided. What should we be doing today? I think that we need to significantly increase the childcare benefits for children under the age of one-and-a-half. Last year we increased this benefit from 500 roubles to 700 roubles. I know that many deputies actively supported this decision. I propose that we increase the childcare benefit for the first child from 700 roubles to 1,500 roubles a month, and that we increase the benefit for the second child to 3,000 roubles a month. Women who had jobs but then take maternity leave and child care leave until it is one-and-a-half should receive from the state not less than 40 percent of their previous wage. We realise that we will have to set an upper threshold from which this sum is counted. I hope that the government will work together with the deputies to set this threshold. Whatever the case, the total benefit should not be lower than what a woman who did not previously work would receive, that is to say, 1,500 roubles and 3,000 roubles respectively. Another problem is getting women back into the workforce again. In this respect I propose introducing compensation for the expenses families pay for pre-school childcare. Compensation for the first child would come to 20 percent of expenses, for the second 50 percent, and for the third 70 percent of the average amount the parents actually pay for the pre-school childcare facility. I draw your attention to the fact that I said that compensation would be for the expenses the parents actually pay and not for the costs for the childcare facility. The regional leaders understand what I am talking about. It is up to the regional and local authorities to ensure that there are enough kindergartens and nurseries to cover demand. We also need to work together with the regions to develop a programme providing financial incentives for placing orphans and children whose parents are unable to care for them in family care. We currently have some 200,000 children living in children’s homes and orphanages. In reality the number of orphans is far higher, but around 200,000 of them are in children’s homes. It seems to me that foreigners are adopting more of our children than we ourselves are. I propose that we double the benefit paid to guardians or foster parents of children and make it at least 4,000 roubles a month. I also propose considerably increasing the wage paid to foster parents from 1,000–1,500 roubles a month to 2,500 roubles a month. And we should also increase the one-off payment made to families taking in children, regardless of the form chosen for placing the child with a family, to 8,000 roubles, that is, equal to the one-off payment made for giving birth to a child. I instruct the government to work together with the regions to create a mechanism that will make it possible to reduce the number of children in institutions. We likewise need to take care of the health of future mothers and newborn babies and bring down the infant mortality and disability rates. I propose that we increase the value of the childbirth certificates that were introduced last year and have worked well so far. I propose that we increase their value from 2,000 roubles to 3,000 roubles for pregnancy centres and from 5,000 roubles to 7,000 roubles for maternity homes. This additional money should be used for buying the necessary medicines for women and providing a higher quality of medical services. This must take into account the views of the patients themselves, the women, and I stress this point. We need to develop such a mechanism. This is not difficult to do. We also need to move rapidly to adopt a programme to create a network of perinatal centres and ensure that maternity homes have all the necessary equipment, special transport and other technology they need.Finally, and most effective in my view, is a measure to ensure material support. I think that the state has a duty to help women who have given birth to a second child and end up out of the workplace for a long time, losing their skills. I think that, unfortunately, women in this situation often end up in a dependent and frankly even degraded position within the family. We should not be shy about discussing these issues openly and we must do so if we want to resolve these problems. If the state is genuinely interested in increasing the birth rate, it must support women who decide to have a second child. The state should provide such women with an initial maternity capital that will raise their social status and help to resolve future problems. Mothers could make use of this capital in different ways: put it towards improving their housing situation, for example, by investing it in buying a house, making use of a mortgage loan or other loan scheme once the child is three years old, or putting it towards the children’s education, or, if they wish, putting it into the individual account part of their own old-age pension. Experts say that these kinds of state support measures should total at least 250,000 roubles, and this sum should be indexed to annual inflation, of course. The question arises of what to do with the families who already have at least two children. This is an important question and I am sure that the deputies will come to a carefully thought-through decision in this respect. Of course, carrying out all of these plans will require a lot of work and an immense amount of money. I ask you to work out the obligations the state would increasingly bear in this case over the years and give the programme a timeframe of at least 10 years at the end of which the state can decide on future action depending on the economic and demographic situation in the country. Finally, the money needed to begin implementing these measures should be allocated in the budget for next year. This mechanism should be launched starting on January 1, 2007. I also ask you to work together with the government on the implementation procedures for carrying out this programme I have proposed. Concluding on this subject, I note that we cannot resolve the problem of the low birth rate without changing the attitudes within our society to families and family values. Academician Likhachev once wrote that “love for one’s homeland, for one’s country, starts with love for one’s family”. We need to restore these time-honoured values of love and care for family and home. While concentrating on raising the birth rate and supporting young families, we must also not forget about the older generation. These are people who have devoted their entire lives to their country, who laboured for their country and who, if necessary, rose to its defence. We must do all that we can to ensure them a decent life. As you know, we have raised pensions on a number of occasions over recent years, and ahead of the planned timeframe. Next year we will again raise pensions by almost 20 percent overall. The state is allocating considerable money to providing social benefits and guarantees for pensioners and veterans. We need to continue our programme for providing state-funded housing for pensioners and veterans, including through using additional funds that are part of the Affordable Housing project. I ask you to continue focusing on this work as a key priority. Distinguished deputies and members of the Federation Council,In order to calmly and confidently resolve all the issues I have mentioned, issues of peaceful life, we need convincing responses to the national security threats that we face. The world is changing rapidly and a large number of new problems have arisen, problems that our country has found itself facing. These threats are less predictable than before and just how dangerous they are has not yet been fully gauged and realised. Overall, we see that conflict zones are expanding in the world and, what is especially dangerous is that they are spreading into the area of our vital interests. The terrorist threat remains very real. Local conflicts remain a fertile breeding ground for terrorists, a source of their arms and a field upon which they can test their strength in practice. These conflicts often arise on ethnic grounds, often with inter-religious conflict thrown in, which is artificially fomented and manipulated by extremists of all shades. I know that there are those out there who would like to see Russia become so mired in these problems that it will not be able to resolve its own problems and achieve full development. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction also represents a serious danger. If these weapons were to fall into the hands of terrorists, and they pursue this aim, the consequences would be simply disastrous. I stress that we unambiguously support strengthening the non-proliferation regime, without any exceptions, on the basis of international law. We know that strong-arm methods rarely achieve the desired result and that their consequences can even be more terrible than the original threat. I would like to raise another important issue today. Disarmament was an important part of international politics for decades. Our country made an immense contribution to maintaining strategic stability in the world. But with the acute threat of international terrorism now on everyone’s minds the key disarmament issues are all but off the international agenda, and yet it is too early to speak of an end to the arms race. What’s more, the arms race has entered a new spiral today with the achievement of new levels of technology that raise the danger of the emergence of a whole arsenal of so-called destabilising weapons. There are still no clear guarantees that weapons, including nuclear weapons, will not be deployed in outer space. There is the potential threat of the creation and proliferation of small capacity nuclear charges. Furthermore, the media and expert circles are already discussing plans to use intercontinental ballistic missiles to carry non-nuclear warheads. The launch of such a missile could provoke an inappropriate response from one of the nuclear powers, could provoke a full-scale counterattack using strategic nuclear forces. And meanwhile far from everyone in the world has abandoned the old bloc mentality and the prejudices inherited from the era of global confrontation despite the great changes that have taken place. This is also a great hindrance in working together to find suitable responses to the common problems we face. Taking into account all of the above, Russia’s military and foreign policy doctrines must also provide responses to the issues of today, namely, how to work together with our partners in current conditions, to fight effectively not just terrorism but also the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and bacteriological weapons, how to settle the local conflicts in the world today and how to overcome the other new challenges we face. Finally, we need to make very clear that the key responsibility for countering all of these threats and ensuring global security will lie with the world’s leading powers, the countries that possess nuclear weapons and powerful levers of military and political influence. This is why the issue of modernising Russia’s Armed Forces is extremely important today and is of such concern to Russian society. The addresses of recent years have all dealt with various national security problems. Today I want to look more closely at the current state of the Russian Armed Forces and their development prospects. These days we are honouring our veterans and congratulating them on Victory Day. One of the biggest lessons of World War II is the importance of maintaining the combat readiness of the armed forces. I point out that our defence spending as a share of GDP is comparable or slightly less than in the other nuclear powers, France or Britain, for example. In terms of absolute figures, and we all know that in the end it is absolute figures that count, our defence spending is half that of the countries I mentioned, and bears no comparison at all with the defence spending figures in the United States. Their defence budget in absolute figures is almost 25 times bigger than Russia’s. This is what in defence is referred to as ‘their home – their fortress’. And good on them, I say. Well done! But this means that we also need to build our home and make it strong and well protected. We see, after all, what is going on in the world. The wolf knows who to eat, as the saying goes. It knows who to eat and is not about to listen to anyone, it seems. How quickly all the pathos of the need to fight for human rights and democracy is laid aside the moment the need to realise one’s own interests comes to the fore. In the name of one’s own interests everything is possible, it turns out, and there are no limits. But though we realise the full seriousness of this problem, we must not repeat the mistakes of the Soviet Union, the mistakes of the Cold War era, neither in politics nor in defence strategy. We must not resolve our defence issues at the expense of economic and social development. This is a dead end road that ultimately leaves a country’s reserves exhausted. There is no future in it. Of course, the question arises whether we can reliably ensure our security in a situation of such disparity with the other leading powers. Of course we can, and I will say how now. I propose that we look at this issue in more detail. A few years ago the structure of the country’s armed forces was not in keeping with the reality of today’s situation. The armed forces were no longer receiving any modern equipment. Not a single new ship was built between 1996 and 2000 and only 40 new items of military equipment were commissioned by the armed forces. The troops carried out military exercises on maps, only on maps, the navy never left the docks and the air force never got to fly. When the need arose to counter a large-scale attack by international terrorists in the North Caucasus in 1999, the problems in the armed forces became painfully evident. I remember very clearly a conversation I had with the chief of General Staff at that time. He is probably present here today. In order to effectively repel the terrorists we needed to put together a group of at least 65,000 men, but the combat ready units in the entire army came to only 55,000 men, and they were scattered throughout the entire country. Our armed forces came to a total of 1,400,000 men but there wasn’t enough men to fight. This is how kids who had never seen combat before were sent in to fight. I will not forget this ever. And it is our task today to make sure that this never happens again. The situation in the armed forces today has changed dramatically. We have created a modern structure for the armed forces and the different units are now receiving modern, new arms and equipment, arms and equipment that will form the basis of our defence through to 2020. This year saw the start of mass defence equipment procurement for the Defence Ministry’s needs. Naval shipbuilding has got underway again and we are now building new vessels of practically all types. The Russian Navy will soon commission two new nuclear submarines carrying strategic weapons. They will be equipped with the new Bulava missile system, which together with the Topol-M system will form the backbone of our strategic deterrent force. I emphasise that these are the first nuclear submarines to be completed in modern Russia. We had not built a single vessel of this type since 1990. Five Strategic Missile regiments have already received silo-based Topol-M missiles, and one of our missile divisions will also receive the mobile version of the Topol-M system this year. Another important indicator over recent years is that intensive combat and operational training is being conducted among the troops. Dozens of field exercises and long-distance sea voyages have been organised. One just finished today. The result of these changes has been to boost combat spirit and improve the morale of soldiers and officers. We know examples of what it is no exaggeration to call mass heroism among military servicemen and law enforcement personnel. The changes in the structure of the military budget are also an indicator of change. Defence spending has increased from year to year. An ever greater share of this money is going precisely into improving the quality of the armed forces. Over the coming years we must reach the goal of having at least half of the defence budget being spent on development. Every budget rouble must be spent carefully and for the designated purpose. I have long since raised the issue of the need to establish a unified procurement and supply system for arms, military equipment and rear support. The government must settle this issue by the end of the year and complete this work and then establish a federal civilian agency with the according powers. I very much hope that this will also have a positive impact on overcoming corruption in the armed forces. Now I would like to name the main demands regarding the missions our armed forces must be ready fulfil. Over the next five years we will have to significantly increase the number of modern long range aircraft, submarines and launch systems in our strategic nuclear forces. Work is already underway today on creating unique high-precision weapons systems and manoeuvrable combat units that will have an unpredictable flight trajectory for the potential opponent. Along with the means for overcoming anti-missile defences that we already have, these new types of arms will enable us to maintain what is definitely one of the most important guarantees of lasting peace, namely, the strategic balance of forces. We must take into account the plans and development vectors of other countries’ armed forces, and we must keep ourselves informed on promising developments, but we should not go after quantity and simply throw our money to the wind. Our responses must be based on intellectual superiority. They will be asymmetrical, not as costly, but they will unquestionably make our nuclear triad more reliable and effective. Modern Russia needs an army that has every possibility for making an adequate response to all the modern threats we face. We need armed forces able to simultaneously fight in global, regional and — if necessary — also in several local conflicts. We need armed forces that guarantee Russia’s security and territorial integrity no matter what the scenario. Another important demand is that the armed forces be professional and mobile. I particularly note that we have made the necessary personnel cutbacks over the last five years. The process of bringing the size of the armed forces down to an optimum 1 million servicemen will not require further special cutbacks but will be reached as officers who have served their time take their retirement. This scaling down will be achieved only through cutting back the bureaucratic apparatus. The combat units will not be affected by any more cutbacks. Changes will also be made to the military command system and the mobilisation system will be improved. By 2008, professional servicemen should account for two thirds of the armed forces. All of this will enable us to reduce compulsory military service to one year. Once the permanently combat-ready units are all manned by contract servicemen, we must also, starting 2009, begin filling posts for sergeants, master sergeants, and for above-water craft crews on principle of contract service. The armed forces units stationed in Chechnya are all manned by contract servicemen. As from January 1, 2007, the Interior Ministry troops in Chechnya will also all be contract servicemen. In other words, we will no longer use conscript servicemen at all in anti-terrorist operations. By 2011 our general purpose forces should include around 600 permanently combat-ready units. A much larger number of such units will be created in fighter plane units and military aviation, in the air defence forces, communications, radio-electronic reconnaissance and electronic warfare units. If need be, we will be able to quickly put into place mobile and self-sufficient units in any potentially dangerous area. Professionally trained units and permanently combat-ready units will form the backbone of these forces. Service in the Russian Armed Forces should be modern and genuinely prestigious. People serving their motherland should have a high social and material status and benefit from solid social guarantees. By 2010 we should have definitively resolved the issue of permanent housing for servicemen and by 2012 we should have resolved the issue of service housing. We also plan a number of wage rises for the military over the coming years. At the same time we are developing the healthcare and insurance system for servicemen. Finally, the issue of increasing discipline among the troops is an equally important task. The political problems of the transition period and the lack of funding meant that the army was essentially just taking what it could get to fulfil its personnel needs, and this also led to worse conditions of service and a drop in the level of combat preparedness. A huge number of young men of conscript age today suffer from chronic diseases and have problems with drinking, smoking and sometimes drugs as well. I think that in our schools we need not just to educate our young people but also see to their physical and patriotic development. We need to restore the system of pre-conscription military training and help develop military sports. The government should adopt the appropriate programme in this area. The regional authorities should not just be seriously concerned with meeting conscription figures but are also responsible for ensuring that the recruits satisfy quality requirements, and they should carry out preparatory work in close contact with the armed forces themselves. Administrative measures alone are not enough to really change the situation. We need to realise that the armed forces are part of ourselves, part of our society, and that service in their ranks is of immense importance for the country and for the entire Russian people. Reflecting on the basic principles on which the Russian state should be built, the well known Russian thinker Ivan Ilyin said that the calling of soldier is a high and honourable title and that the soldier “represents the national unity of the people, the will of the Russian state, strength and honour”. We must always be ready to repel potential aggression from outside and to counter international terrorist attack. We must be able to respond to attempts from any quarters to put foreign policy pressure on Russia, including with the aim of strengthening one’s own position at our expense. We also need to make clear that the stronger our armed forces are, the lesser the temptation for anyone to put such pressure on us, no matter under what pretext this is done. Dear colleagues,Russia’s modern foreign policy is based on the principles of pragmatism, predictability and the supremacy of international law. I would like to say a few words today about the state of relations and prospects for cooperation with our main partners, and above all, about relations with our nearest neighbours, with the countries of the CIS. The debate on the very need for and future of the Commonwealth of Independent States still continues to this day and we all have an interest in working on reform of the CIS. The CIS clearly helped us to get through the period of putting in place partnership relations between the newly formed young states without any great losses and played a positive part in containing regional conflicts in the post-Soviet area. I stress that it was Russia that helped defuse the tension in many of these conflicts. We will continue to carry out our peacekeeping mission in all responsibility. The CIS experience has also given rise to several productive economic cooperation initiatives. The Union State with Belarus, the Eurasian Economic Community and the Common Economic Space are all developing in parallel today, based on the shared interests of the partners involved. Together we are resolving the problems that no one else will settle for us. We see in practice that multilateral partnership enables us to do this at much less cost and far more effectively. The CIS has provided a good basis for the formation of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation that brings together countries genuinely interested in close military and political cooperation. Finally, without diminishing the importance of the other aspects of reform in any way, I note the particularly promising project of strengthening our common humanitarian space, which has not just a rich historical and human foundation but now offers new social and economic opportunities. Throughout the CIS a difficult but active search for optimum cooperation models is underway. Russia states clearly and firmly that the end result we want from this search is the creation of an optimum economic system that would ensure the effective development of each of its participants. I repeat that our relations with our closest neighbours were and remain a most important part of the Russian Federation’s foreign policy. I would like to say a few words briefly about our cooperation with our other partners. Our biggest partner is the European Union. Our ongoing dialogue with the EU creates favourable conditions for mutually beneficial economic ties and for developing scientific, cultural, educational and other exchanges. Our joint work on implementing the concept of the common spaces is an important part of the development of Europe as a whole. Of great importance for us and for the entire international system are our relations with the United States of America, with the People’s Republic of China, with India, and also with the fast-growing countries of the Asia-Pacific Region, Latin America and Africa. We are willing to take new steps to expand the areas and framework of our cooperation with these countries, increase cooperation in ensuring global and regional security, develop mutual trade and investment and expand cultural and educational ties. I wish to stress that at this time of globalisation when a new international architecture is in the process of formation, the role of the United Nations Organisation has taken on new importance. This is the most representative and universal international forum and it remains the backbone of the modern world order. It is clear that the foundations of this global organisation were laid during an entirely different era and that reform is indisputably necessary. Russia, which is taking an active part in this work, sees two points of being of principle importance. First, reform should make the UN’s work more effective. Second, reform should have the broad support of a maximum number of the UN’s member states. Without consensus in the UN it will be very difficult to ensure harmony in the world. The UN system should be the regulator that enables us to work together to draw up a new code of behaviour in the international arena, a code of behaviour that meets the challenges of our times and that we are so in need of today in this globalising world. Distinguished members of the Federal Assembly, Citizens of Russia, In conclusion I would like to say once more that today’s address, like previous addresses, sets out the basic directions of our domestic and foreign policy for the coming decades. They are designed for the long term and are not dictated by fluctuations of the moment. Previous addresses have focused on construction of our political system, improving the state power system and local self-government, have examined in detail the modernisation of our social sphere and have set new economic goals. Today I have set out our vision of what place we want to hold in the international division of labour and the new architecture of international relations. I have also examined in detail what we can do to resolve the complex demographic problem we face and to develop our armed forces. The steps proposed are very concrete. Russia has immense development opportunities and huge potential that we need to put to full use in order to better the lives of our people. Without question we realise the full scale of the work at hand. I am sure that we will be up to the task. Thank you for your attention.",2006
"MoscowPresident Vladimir Putin:Distinguished Members of the Federal Assembly,Citizens of Russia,In this Address of 2005 I will dwell on a number of fundamental ideological and political issues. I believe such a discussion is essential at the current stage of Russia's development. The most important social and economic tasks facing us, including specific national projects, were set out in the previous Address. I intend to elaborate them in the coming Budget Address and in a series of other documents. At the same time I would ask you to consider last year's and this year’s Address to the Federal Assembly as a unified program of action, as our joint program for the next decade.I consider the development of Russia as a free and democratic state to be our main political and ideological goal. We use these words fairly frequently, but rarely care to reveal how the deeper meaning of such values as freedom and democracy, justice and legality is translated into life. Meanwhile, there is a need for such an analysis. The objectively difficult processes going on in Russia are increasingly becoming the subject of heated ideological discussions. And they are all connected with talk about freedom and democracy. Sometimes you can hear that since the Russian people have been silent for centuries, they are not used to or do not need freedom. And for that reason, it is claimed our citizens need constant supervision. I would like to bring those who think this way back to reality, to the facts. To do so, I will recall once more Russia’s most recent history. Above all, we should acknowledge that the collapse of the Soviet Union was a major geopolitical disaster of the century. As for the Russian nation, it became a genuine drama. Tens of millions of our co-citizens and compatriots found themselves outside Russian territory. Moreover, the epidemic of disintegration infected Russia itself. Individual savings were depreciated, and old ideals destroyed. Many institutions were disbanded or reformed carelessly. Terrorist intervention and the Khasavyurt capitulation that followed damaged the country's integrity. Oligarchic groups – possessing absolute control over information channels – served exclusively their own corporate interests. Mass poverty began to be seen as the norm. And all this was happening against the backdrop of a dramatic economic downturn, unstable finances, and the paralysis of the social sphere. Many thought or seemed to think at the time that our young democracy was not a continuation of Russian statehood, but its ultimate collapse, the prolonged agony of the Soviet system. But they were mistaken.That was precisely the period when the significant developments took place in Russia. Our society was generating not only the energy of self-preservation, but also the will for a new and free life. In those difficult years, the people of Russia had to both uphold their state sovereignty and make an unerring choice in selecting a new vector of development in the thousand years of their history. They had to accomplish the most difficult task: how to safeguard their own values, not to squander undeniable achievements, and confirm the viability of Russian democracy. We had to find our own path in order to build a democratic, free and just society and state. When speaking of justice, I am not of course referring to the notorious ”take away and divide by all“ formula, but extensive and equal opportunities for everybody to develop. Success for everyone. A better life for all. In the ultimate analysis, by affirming these principles, we should become a free society of free people. But in this context it would be appropriate to remember how Russian society formed an aspiration for freedom and justice, how this aspiration matured in the public mind. Above all else Russia was, is and will, of course, be a major European power. Achieved through much suffering by European culture, the ideals of freedom, human rights, justice and democracy have for many centuries been our society's determining values. For three centuries, we – together with the other European nations – passed hand in hand through reforms of Enlightenment, the difficulties of emerging parliamentarism, municipal and judiciary branches, and the establishment of similar legal systems. Step by step, we moved together toward recognizing and extending human rights, toward universal and equal suffrage, toward understanding the need to look after the weak and the impoverished, toward women's emancipation, and other social gains.I repeat we did this together, sometimes behind and sometimes ahead of European standards. It is my firm belief that for present-day Russia democratic values are no less important than economic success or people’s social welfare. First, every law-abiding citizen is only entitled to firm legal guarantees and state protection in a free and just society. And, no doubt, safeguarding rights and freedoms is crucial both to Russia's economic development and its social and political life. The right to be elected or appointed to a state post, as well as the opportunity to use public services and public information, must be equally available to all the country’s citizens. And any person who breaks the law must know that punishment is inevitable. Second, only in a free society do economically active citizens have the right to participate in a competitive struggle as equals and choose their partners, and earn accordingly. The prosperity of every individual should be determined by his or her labor and abilities, qualifications, and effort. Everyone has the right to dispose of what he or she earned at will, including bequeathing it to his/her children. In that way, the observance of principles of justice is directly connected with the equality of opportunities. And this in turn must be guaranteed by no one other than the state. Third, the Russian state, if it wants to be just, must help its impoverished citizens and those that cannot work – the disabled, pensioners and orphans. These people must live a decent life and the main benefits must be accessible to them. All these functions and duties are directly invested in the state by society. And finally a free and just society has no internal borders or travel restrictions, and is open to the rest of the world. This enables citizens of our country to fully enjoy the benefits of human civilization in its entirety, including education, science, world history and culture. It is our values that determine our desire to see Russia's state independence grow, and its sovereignty strengthened. Ours is a free nation. And our place in the modern world, I wish to particularly emphasize this, will only depend on how strong and successful we are. I dealt at such length with these key and on the whole general concepts to show how these principles must be reflected in our daily work. I think these activities should be pursued as a minimum along three lines: first – measures to develop the state; second – strengthening the law, developing the political system, and making the judicial system more effective; and, third – developing the individual and civil societyas a whole.  First, about the state.You know that in the last five years we have had to tackle difficult tasks to prevent the degradation of state and public institutions in our country. At the same time, we had to create the foundation for development in the next few years and decades. We cleared the debris together and gradually moved ahead. In that sense, the stabilization policy was practically a policy of reaction to the accumulated problems. This policy was, in general, successful. However, it has reached the limit of its effectiveness. It must be replaced with a policy oriented towards the future. And for that, we must have an efficient state. However, despite many positive changes, this key problem has not been solved so far.Our bureaucratic apparatus is still largely an exclusive and often arrogant caste regarding state service as an alternative form of business. Therefore, our priority remains making state management more effective, ensuring that officials strictly obey the law, and quality public services are provided to the population.A specific feature of recent times has been that the dishonest part of our bureaucracy (at the federal and local levels alike) has been particularly keen on using the achieved stability in its own mercenary interests. It started using the favorable conditions and emerging opportunities to achieve its own selfish goals rather than to increase the prosperity of society.It is worth mentioning that in this respect the party and corporate elites behave no better than the state bureaucracy.Today, when we have created the necessary preconditions for serious and large-scale work, if the state falls into the trap of finding simplified solutions, the bureaucratic reaction will only benefit from it. Instead of a breakthrough, we will face stagnation. The potential of civil society will not be used effectively, while the level of corruption, irresponsibility and lack of professionalism will rocket, throwing us back on the way of economic and intellectual degradation and creating a growing rift between the authorities and public interests, with state apparatus refusing to heed public requests.I repeat: we cannot be satisfied with the current situation in the country. While freeing major mass media from the oligarchs’ censorship, we failed to protect them from the unhealthy zeal of certain officials. Focusing the efforts of law enforcement bodies on the fight against crime, including tax evasion, we encountered frequent violations of the rights of our business community, and sometimes a blatant racket on the part of state officials. Many bureaucrats believe this situation will never be changed, and such violations are the inevitable result of past and current polices.I must disappoint them. Our plans do not include handing over the country to the inefficient rule of a corrupted bureaucracy.We proceed from the idea that it is both essential and economically advantageous to have developed democratic procedures in the country; that it is politically prudent to maintain a responsible dialogue with society. Therefore, a modern Russian official must learn to speak with the public using the modern language of cooperation, the language of common public interest, dialogue and real democracy, rather than the jargon of military orders.This is our fundamental approach and we will strictly follow it. Another important task in the sphere of state development is bolstering the Federation. The major goal that we are pursuing is to build an effective state system within the current national borders.You know that constituent members of the Federation have recently begun to display a desire to unite. It is a positive trend, and it is important to avoid turning it into another political campaign. We should not forget that Federation members do not merge for the sake of unification itself, but to make their management more efficient, and their social and economic policies more effective, which will ultimately lead to increased social prosperity.Naturally, this process is complicated, but in certain cases, and I want to stress, not always or everywhere, but in certain cases, it is the only way to consolidate the state’s resources to manage such a unique and vast country as Russia. After all, many constituent members of the Russian Federation have compound subordination, and they often have to face problems related to the delineation of powers between various state bodies (primarily in the sphere of taxation and budget allocation). However, all the efforts have so far been wasted on disputes and coordination, and sometimes even on legal action in the courts, including the Constitutional Court. All this is happening when new opportunities have already emerged and we need to implement a number of large national projects.You know specific examples well. The ongoing unification of the Krasnoyarsk Region, the Taimyr and the Evenkia autonomous districts must help the development of new deposits of natural resources and provide the eastern regions of Siberia with constant energy supplies. Clear and sound administrative decisions must open up new opportunities for major investments in the development of Russia’s regions. In my opinion a third important task is to pursue vigorous policy in promoting liberalization in private enterprise. I’d like to focus on measures to stabilize civil law relations and to achieve a dramatic increase in opportunities for free enterprise and capital investment. First, measures need to be taken to consolidate civil law relations. I have already mentioned that we should reduce the statute of limitations for minor transactions to three years. Now this statute is 10 years. This proposal is already in the focus of a broad discussion and for this reason I would like to emphasize once again the ideas that guided us.Stability of the right to private property is the alpha and omega of any business. The rules to which the state adheres in this sphere should be clear to everyone, and, importantly, these rules should be stable. This enables people developing their business to plan normally both this business and their own lives. This allows citizens to feel comfortable and conclude, without any apprehensions, contracts on such vital issues as the acquisition of housing or its privatization, which has already been almost completed in our country. In general, this encourages people to buy property and expand production.At the same time, those people who deviated from law in business transactions cannot be ignored. The state should certainly respond to that. But I must point out that three years is also a big term that gives both the parties concerned and the state enough time for clearing up their relations in court. I’d like to emphasize that a three-year statute of limitations has been the longest one in our legislation in the last hundred years. Ten years is too long both in terms of economic and legal considerations. Such a term creates a host of uncertainties, primarily dampening the ardor of the state, and not only of the state but also of other participants in the process. Incidentally, we have submitted our proposals on the relevant amendments to law to the Government of the Russian Federation. Regrettably, we have not heard a thing from them so far even though all they have to do is to amend one word in one clause. I request that formal agreement be accelerated.Secondly, it is necessary to help our citizens legalize in a simplified way the real estate that belongs to them de facto. I mean garages, housing, suburban cottages and the relevant land plots in different cooperative societies and horticultural associations.The legalization procedures should be as simple as possible, while the relevant paperwork should not create additional difficulties for our citizens. Incidentally, this will open up such additional opportunities as the legal inheritance of property, and will allow citizens to take out a mortgage in a bank with this property as security.And, thirdly, the flow of capital accumulated by our citizens needs to be encouraged into our national economy. Citizens should be allowed to declare the money they have saved in previous years, in the previous period, in a simplified procedure. This procedure should be accompanied by only two provisions: one should pay a 13 per cent income tax and deposit the relevant sums into Russian bank accounts.This money should work in our economy, in our country, not lie in offshore zones.Another, systemic task of state development, in my view, is concerned with the work of tax and customs agencies. I believe their priority task should be to check compliance with tax and customs legislation, rather than the fulfillment of some “plans” to collect taxes and duties.The fiscal agencies in any country should obviously exercise control over the correct payment of taxes. But it would be fair to say that our tax system has been in the making in the past few years; it took time and rich legal and judicial practice to receive clear answers to all of our questions.The fiscal agencies must not close their eyes to legal violations. But we should find ways for back taxes from previous years to be repaid in the interests of the state without destroying the economy and pushing business into a corner. The tax agencies must not “terrorize” business by returning to the same problem again and again. They should work rhythmically, promptly reacting to violations but spotlighting above all inspections of the current period.I believe that all of the above measures will help stabilize civil transactions, create additional guarantees for the long-term development of business, and ultimately ensure greater freedom of enterprise and a fair approach taken by the state to it.And finally, one more crucial problem: Russia is extremely interested in a major inflow of private, including foreign, investment. This is our strategic choice and strategic approach.In practice, investors sometimes face all kinds of limitations, including some that are explained by national security reasons, though these limitations are not legally formalized. This uncertainty creates problems for the state and investors.It is time we clearly determined the economic sectors where the interests of bolstering Russia’s independence and security call for predominant control by national, including state, capital. I mean some infrastructure facilities, enterprises that fulfill state defense orders, mineral deposits of strategic importance for the future of the country and future generations, as well as infrastructural monopolies. We should draft and legally formalize a system of criteria to determine the limitations on foreign participation in such sectors of the economy. Simultaneously a corresponding list of industries or facilities will be determined that shall not be extended or receive extended interpretation. Some industrialized countries use this approach and we should also use it. While maintaining such control and limitations in some economic sectors, we should create favorable conditions for the inflow of private capital to all the other attractive sectors. I think you will agree that, regrettably, we have accomplished too little in this sphere so far. I repeat, all of these decisions must be formalized in legislation. The goal of these measures is apparent: investors do not need riddles and charades. They will invest their money only in a stable economy with clear and comprehensible rules of the game. And this approach will be fair to both society and the state, which should protect its prospective interests and take care of the country’s development for years and decades to come. Dear Colleagues,The creation of an effective legal and political system is an essential condition for developing democracy in our country. But developing democratic procedures should not come at the cost of law and order, the stability that we worked so hard to achieve, or the continued pursuit of our chosen economic course. The democratic road we have chosen is independent in nature, a road along which we move ahead, all the while taking into account our own specific internal circumstances. But we must and we shall move forward, basing our action on the laws and on the guarantees our constitution provides. Of course, the state authorities must refrain from any abuse of the administrative levers they have at their disposal, and must work continually to open up new opportunities for building up the institutions of a genuine democracy in our country. To deny our people, to deny ourselves the ability to live according to democratic laws is to have no respect either for ourselves or for our fellow citizens and would signify that we neither understand the past nor see the future.“State power,” wrote the great Russian philosopher Ivan Ilyin, “has its own limits defined by the fact that it is authority that reaches people from outside… State power cannot oversee and dictate the creative states of the soul and mind, the inner states of love, freedom and goodwill. The state cannot demand from its citizens faith, prayer, love, goodness and conviction. It cannot regulate scientific, religious and artistic creation… It should not intervene in moral, family and daily private life, and only when extremely necessary should it impinge on people’s economic initiative and creativity”. Let us not forget this.Russia is a country that has chosen democracy through the will of its own people. It chose this road of its own accord and it will decide itself how best to ensure that the principles of freedom and democracy are realised here, taking into account our historic, geopolitical and other particularities and respecting all fundamental democratic norms. As a sovereign nation, Russia can and will decide for itself the timeframe and conditions for its progress along this road. But consistent development of democracy in Russia is possible only through legal means. All methods of fighting for national, religious and other interests that are outside the law contradict the very principles of democracy and the state will react to such methods firmly but within the law. We want all our law-abiding citizens to be able to be proud of the work of our law enforcement agencies and not to cross the street when they see someone in uniform. There can be no place in our law enforcement agencies for people whose primary aim is to fill their own pockets rather than uphold the law. The motivation for our law enforcement officers should be above all about providing quality protection of our citizens’ rights and freedoms.Finally, if part of Russian society continues to see the court system as corrupt, there can be no speaking of an effective justice system in our country. Overall, I want to note that we need principally new approaches to fighting crime in our country. The relevant decisions will be prepared.  Eradicating the sources of terrorist aggression on Russian territory is an integral part of ensuring law and order in our country. We have taken many serious steps in the fight against terrorism over recent years. But we cannot allow ourselves to have any illusions – the threat is still very real, we still find ourselves being dealt serious blows and criminals are still committing terrible crimes in the aim of frightening society. We need to summon our courage and continue our work to eradicate terrorism. The moment we show signs of weakness, lack of firmness, the losses would become immeasurably greater and could result in a national disaster. I hope for energetic work to strengthen security in the southern part of Russia and firmly establish the values of freedom and justice there. Developing the economy, creating new jobs and building social and production infrastructure are prerequisites for this work. I support the idea of holding parliamentary elections in the Republic of Chechnya this year. These elections should lay the foundation for stability and for developing democracy in this region. I want to note that the North Caucasus region already has good conditions for achieving rapid economic growth. The region has one of Russia’s best-developed transport infrastructures, a qualified labour force, and surveys show that the number of people in this region wanting to start up their own business is higher than the national average. At the same time, however, the shadow economy accounts for a bigger share in this region and there is criminalisation of economic relations in general. In this respect, the authorities should not only work on strengthening the law enforcement and court systems in the region, but should also help develop business activity among the population. We should be paying no less attention to other strategically important regions of the Russian Federation. Here, I am referring to the Far East, Kaliningrad Region and other border areas. In these areas we should be concentrating state resources on expanding the transport, telecommunications and energy infrastructure, including through the creation of cross-continent corridors. These regions should become key bases for our cooperation with our neighbours.  Esteemed Assembly,Very soon, on May 9, we shall celebrate the 60th anniversary of victory. This day can be justly called the day of civilisation’s triumph over fascism. Our common victory enabled us to defend the principles of freedom, independence and equality between all peoples and nations. It is clear for us that this victory was not achieved through arms alone but was won also through the strong spirit of all the peoples who were united at that time within a single state. Their unity emerged victorious over inhumanity, genocide and the ambitions of one nation to impose its will on others. But the terrible lessons of the past also define imperatives for the present. And Russia, bound to the former Soviet republics – now independent countries – through a common history, and through the Russian language and the great culture that we share, cannot stay away from the common desire for freedom. Today, with independent countries now formed and developing in the post-Soviet area, we want to work together to correspond to humanistic values, open up broad possibilities for personal and collective success, achieve for ourselves the standards of civilisation we have worked hard for – standards that would emerge as a result of common economic, humanitarian and legal space. While standing up for Russia’s foreign political interests, we also want our closest neighbours to develop their economies and strengthen their international authority. We would like to achieve synchronisation of the pace and parameters of reform processes underway in Russia and the other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. We are ready to draw on the genuinely useful experience of our neighbours and also to share with them our own ideas and the results of our work. Our objectives on the international stage are very clear – to ensure the security of our borders and create favourable external conditions for the resolution of our domestic problems. We are not inventing anything new and we seek to make use of all that European civilisation and world history has accumulated. Also certain is that Russia should continue its civilising mission on the Eurasian continent. This mission consists in ensuring that democratic values, combined with national interests, enrich and strengthen our historic community. We consider international support for the respect of the rights of Russians abroad an issue of major importance, one that cannot be the subject of political and diplomatic bargaining. We hope that the new members of NATO and the European Union in the post-Soviet area will show their respect for human rights, including the rights of ethnic minorities, through their actions. Countries that do not respect and cannot guarantee human rights themselves do not have the right to demand that others respect these same rights. We are also ready to take part in an effective partnership with all countries in order to find solutions to global problems – from finding effective ways to protect the environment to space exploration, and from preventing global man-made disasters to addressing the threat of the spread of AIDS. And of course we are also ready to join efforts to fight challenges to the modern world order such as international terrorism, cross-border crime and drug trafficking. I would like now to say a few words about our priorities for developing civil society. [Sergei] Witte once wrote, “The state does not so much create as add substance. The genuine creators are all the citizens themselves… The aim should be not to hinder independence, but to develop it and encourage it in every way”. This piece of advice is still just as relevant today.I think that our primary task should be to ensure that our citizens have objective information. This is a political issue of vital importance and it is directly linked to putting the principles of freedom and justice into practice in our state policy. I think that in this respect the draft law on information openness of the state agencies is a very important document. It is important that it be passed as soon as possible. Its implementation will enable people to receive more objective information about the work of the state bodies and will help them to protect their own interests. I also wanted to raise another, very specific, issue here today, namely, what must be done to ensure that national television fully takes into account Russian civil society’s most relevant needs and protects its interests. We need to establish guarantees that will ensure that state television and radio broadcasting are as objective as possible, free from the influence of any particular groups, and that they reflect the whole spectrum of public and political forces in the country. I propose reinforcing the Public Council’s powers in the area of civilian control over respect for freedom of speech by the television channels. To do this, a commission could be established with the Public Council that would be made up of people respected by the professional community, who would ensure the independence of broadcasting policy and bring in qualified specialists to help them in their work. To this effect, I plan to introduce to the State Duma the relevant amendments to the legislation. Furthermore, all parliamentary factions should have access to the media. I am sure that these proposed measures will improve the quality and objectivity of the information our society receives today, intensify cultural life and enable everyone, even those in the most remote corners of our country, to have access to the immense wealth of achievements that our modern world offers.  Finally, I would like to say a few words about guarantees for the activities of political parties in parliament. I think that every faction should have an equal opportunity to express its views on the key development issues facing the country, propose its representatives to head committees and commissions and seek to have the problems that interest it included on the agenda. I think we also need to confirm by law the procedures for parliamentary investigations. Furthermore, in the interests of continuing to strengthen the role of political parties in forming state power, I propose that the State Council of Russia discuss precisions to the new procedures for appointing the chief officials of the executive branch of power in the regions. The President could propose a representative of the party that wins the regional elections as candidate for this post.  Dear colleagues,Having spoken about the fundamental problems of developing the state and civil society, I cannot ignore a number of concrete issues that are long since needing to be addressed. It is my firm conviction that success in many areas of our life depends on resolving the acute demographic problems we face. We cannot accept the fact that on average Russian women live 10 years less than women in Western European countries, and Russian men live a whole 16 years less on average. But not only can many of the reasons for this mortality rate in Russia be addressed, in many cases the costs involved would not even be very high. For example, almost 100 people a day are killed here in traffic accidents. The reasons for these accidents are well known and we should take a whole series of measures to improve this dramatic situation. We keep coming back to the state of the healthcare sector. An active discussion is underway today to find ways of improving this sector. Without anticipating the final decision, I can say that I am sure that, above all, we need to ensure that medical care is accessible and of high quality, and we need to revive the traditions of preventive medicine as a part of the Russian healthcare system. I particularly want to stress another, more complex issue for our society – the consequences of alcoholism and drug addiction. Around 40,000 people a year die from alcohol poisoning in Russia, above all as a result of drinking alcohol surrogates. Most of these people are young men, the breadwinners for their families. But prohibitive methods will not resolve this problem. Our work should be focused on encouraging the young generation to make a conscious choice in favour of a healthy way of life, encourage them to get involved in sports and physical culture. Every young man should be aware that a healthy way of life is a key to success, a key to his personal success. But I did not see any desire to address this problem at federal level when I looked through the budget programmes for next year and the government’s investment programmes. We realise that these issues come more under the competence of the regional and municipal authorities, but without support from the federal government we will not manage to resolve this problem. I ask you to make the necessary changes. The low birth rate is another national problem. There are more and more families in the country with just one child. We need to make being a mother and being a father more prestigious and create conditions that will encourage people to give birth and raise children. Incidentally, I think it would be a good decision to abolish the inheritance tax, because billion-dollar fortunes are all hidden away in off-shore zones anyway and are not handed down here. Meanwhile, people have to pay sums they often cannot even afford here just for some little garden shack.I also think that an increase in our population should be accompanied by a carefully planned immigration policy. It is in our interest to receive a flow of legal and qualified workers. But there are still a lot of companies in Russia making use of the advantages of illegal immigration. Without any rights, after all, illegal immigrants are convenient in that they can be exploited endlessly. They are also a potential danger from the point of view of breaking the law. But the issue here is not just one of scaling back the shadow sector of the economy but of bringing real benefit for the entire Russian state and society. Ultimately, every legal immigrant should have the chance to become a Russian citizen.We cannot afford to postpone tackling these problems. We need to act simultaneously to create conditions that will encourage people to have children, lower the mortality rate and bring order to immigration. I am sure that our society is up to these tasks and that we will gradually stabilise the size of the Russian population. We also must find definitive solutions for other problems that have built up over the years. This concerns, above all, wages for teachers, medical doctors, people working in the arts and sciences, and servicemen. They should finally begin to see benefits from the economic growth in the country. It is they who carry the responsibility for ensuring that future generations of Russian citizens grow up healthy and educated and preserve the traditions and spiritual values of their forebears. It is they who set the modern standards for society’s development and take part in forming the country’s current and future elite. They are the guardians of our country’s rich cultural and spiritual heritage. This is why the quality of these people’s work is no less important for the country than economic growth results. What kind of country we will be living in tomorrow, what level of freedom, justice and democracy we will have, and how reliably our country will be defended all depends on them. But at the same time, the level of real wages in these sectors is still lower than it was at the end of the 1980s. The average public sector wage is still considerably lower than the average wage in the country in general. Of the common tariff grid’s 18 rates, 12 are lower than the survival minimum. In other words, most employees of budget-funded organisations face a very high risk of ending up in poverty. This humiliating situation is stopping people from being able to work effectively and creatively. I think we need to increase public sector wages at least 1.5-fold in real terms over the next three years. In other words, public sector wages should rise at least 1.5 times faster than prices for consumer goods. I stress that what we are talking about here is the necessary minimum below which we must not and do not have the right to go. In this way, we could substantially reduce the disparity between public and private sector wages in the country. And we should also remember that setting wages for most budget-funded organisations and paying them on time is the responsibility of the regional authorities. We need to establish inter-budgetary relations in such a way so that the regions are also able to increase public sector wages at a faster pace. But we should also keep in mind that simply increasing wages is not going to solve all the problems in the public sector. The time has long since come for introducing financial solutions and mechanisms that will encourage better results and more effective organisation of the social sphere. Financial policy should be used as an incentive for increasing the accessibility and quality of social services. Finally, we need to create conditions for actively raising investment from other sources besides state funds into the healthcare, education, science and culture sectors. I want to stress also that the objectives of modernising the education and healthcare systems that were set out in the previous Address should still be pursued, but pursued very carefully. Reorganisation for its own sake is not the aim. The aim is to improve the quality of service, make services accessible for the majority of citizens and ensure that they have a genuine influence on socio-economic progress in the country. In speaking of our values, I would like to raise another issue I think is very important, that of the level of public morals and culture. It is well known that a good business reputation has always been a prerequisite for concluding deals, and human decency has been a necessary condition for taking part in state and public life. Russian society has always condemned immorality, and indecent behaviour has always been publicly reprimanded. Law and morals, politics and morality have traditionally been considered close and related concepts in Russia, at least, such was always the declared ideal and aim. Despite the problems we all know, the level of morality in tsarist Russia and during the Soviet years was always a very meaningful scale and criteria for people’s reputation, at work, in society and in private life. No one can deny that values such as close friendship, mutual assistance, trust, comradeship and reliability have flourished in Russia over the course of centuries, becoming enduring and immutable values here. Prominent Russian legal theorist, Professor Lev Petrazhitsky, noted that the duties to help the needy and pay workers their agreed wages are above all ethical norms of conduct. I want to note that this was written almost 100 years ago, in 1910. I think that unless it follows the basic moral standards accepted in civilised society, Russian business is unlikely to earn a respectable reputation. It will be unlikely to earn respect, not just in the wider world, but even more important, within its own country. After all, many of the difficulties faced by the economy and by politics in Russia today have their roots in precisely this problem of the greater part of Russian society having no trust in the wealthy class. We should remember that corruption among state officials and rising crime are also consequences of the lack of trust and moral strength in our society. Russia will begin to prosper only when the success of each individual depends not only on his level of wealth but also on his decency and level of culture. Dear citizens of Russia,Esteemed Federal Assembly,Our country is about to celebrate the anniversary of our great victory, a victory that came at the terrible cost of countless lives and sacrifices. The soldiers of the Great Patriotic War are justly called the soldiers of freedom. They saved the world from an ideology of hatred and tyranny. They defended our country’s sovereignty and independence. We will always remember this. Our people fought against slavery. They fought for the right to live on their own land, to speak their native language and have their own statehood, culture and traditions. They fought for justice and for freedom. They stood up for their right to independent development and they gave our Motherland a future. Just what kind of future this will be now depends on us, on today’s generation. Thank you for your attention.",2005
"MoscowVladimir Putin:Good afternoon, esteemed members of the Federation Council and the State Duma, Dear citizens of Russia, I think that, as in past years, there is no need in this audience to talk about recent results. We have all worked hard together to achieve them. I would like to note simply that over these last four years, we have traversed a difficult but very important path. Now, for the first time in a long time, Russia is politically and economically stable. It is also independent, both financially and in international affairs, and this is a good result in itself. Our goals are very clear. We want high living standards and a safe, free and comfortable life for the country. We want a mature democracy and a developed civil society. We want to strengthen Russia’s place in the world. But our main goal, I repeat, is to bring about a noticeable rise in our people’s prosperity. We have better knowledge today of our own potential and we know what resources we have at our disposal. We understand the obstacles we could face in reaching the goals we have set and we are actively modernising the state in order to make sure that its functions correspond to the present stage of Russia’s development – that of achieving a real rise in living standards. I would like to recall that over the last decade of the twentieth century, with its economy in a state of collapse and its positions on world markets weakened, Russia found itself having to simultaneously restore its statehood and create what for us was a new kind of economy, a market economy. Furthermore, it also had to defend its territorial integrity in the fight against international terrorism and stand up for the democratic achievements of its people. Russia could be said to have passed through several stages since the beginning of the 1990s. The first stage involved dismantling the old economic system. It brought with it hardships and upheavals to the familiar way of life, acute political and social conflicts and was a very difficult time for our society. The second stage was the time of clearing the debris resulting from demolishing the old edifice. At the same time, we managed to check the most dangerous tendencies in economic and political life. Not all the decisions taken over those years were long-term in nature. In many cases, the federal authorities were more than anything else reacting to the serious threats we faced. In fact, we have only recently reached the third stage in modern Russia’s development, the possibility to achieve more rapid development and resolve more ambitious national tasks. We now have the necessary experience and tools to set ourselves genuinely long-term objectives. Our economy has grown at a good rate overall over the last four years. People’s living standards have risen a little. There has been a 1.5-fold increase in real incomes, and I emphasise that we are talking about real incomes. The number of people with less than subsistence-level incomes has dropped by a third. The economic growth rate was 7.3 percent last year and was 8 percent over the first four months of this year. But even so, we must ask ourselves the question, have we done all we could and have we made use of every opportunity for economic growth and social development? And are we happy with the current state of affairs? No, and above all, we are not happy with living standards in the country. I would remind you that during its lengthy economic crisis, Russia lost almost half of its economic potential. Over the last four years we have managed to compensate for around 40 percent of this drop. But despite our efforts, we have still not caught up to where we were in 1989. Only by maintaining high growth rates of the kind we have now will Russia avoid being relegated to the backwaters of the world economy. We must grow faster than the rest of the world if we want to take the lead within today’s complex rules of global competition. We must be ahead of other countries in our growth rate, in the quality of our goods and services and level of our education, science and culture. This is a question of our economic survival. It is a question of ensuring that Russia takes its deserved place in these changing international conditions. I realise that this is a far from easy task, but we are up to it and we can resolve it only through our own efforts. Whether or not we can become a society of truly free people – free both economically and politically — depends only on us. Reaching our priority national goals depends only on us. These goals are well-known: doubling our gross domestic product over the next decade, reducing poverty, increasing people’s prosperity and modernising the armed forces. Again I would like to say that today, for the first time in many years, we can make forecasts not just for a few months or even a year ahead, but for a decade ahead. Our achievements over recent years now give us the base we need to finally tackle those problems that can be resolved, but only so long as we have certain economic potential, political stability and an active civil society. It is far from everyone in the world that wants to have to deal with an independent, strong and self-reliant Russia. Political, economic and information pressure have become weapons in the global competitive battle today. Our efforts to strengthen our state are sometimes deliberately interpreted as authoritarianism. In this respect I want to say that there will be no going back on the fundamental principles of our politics. Commitment to democratic values is dictated by the will of our people and by the strategic interests of Russia itself. Russia’s greatest competitive asset and the main source of its development is its people. Making our country strong and prosperous requires ensuring a normal life for all our people, those people who are producing quality goods and services, are enriching our national culture and building a new country. In order to open up this potential, we must create the conditions for a safe life and reduce the crime rate in the country. We must improve the nation’s health, prevent increase in drug use and resolve the problem of homeless children. We must bring down the mortality rate, increase people’s life expectancy and overcome the population decline. We could find ourselves already in the near future facing labour shortages and an increased social burden placed on the younger generation of the workforce. As you know, previous addresses tended to focus on the general social and economic objectives facing us. Today I think I should, and can, break with this tradition and focus on the objectives that concern practically every citizen and every Russian family. Our task now is to resolve the most pressing problems for our citizens. These are, above all, accessible and good-quality housing, education and healthcare. We now have the capacities we need to find effective solutions to these problems and I would like to look at them in more detail. * * *Dear colleagues, One of the most pressing problems we face today is providing people with affordable housing. This remains a real problem for the majority of people in Russia. People need decent housing for rest, for work and for starting a normal family. But even the current rise in incomes does not always allow people to buy housing and improve its quality. This is one of the causes of the low mobility that prevents people from moving around the country in search of suitable work. It must be admitted that very many people still live in dilapidated and unsafe buildings and apartments. Not enough housing is being built and what is built often does not measure up to modern safety and quality standards. Only people with high incomes can afford to buy new housing. The fact that young families are unable to afford housing of their own affects their plans to have children, and it is still quite common to find several generations all having to share the same apartment. The conclusion is clear. The old methods and approaches, which did not solve the problem earlier, simply do not work today. We should stop deceiving people, forcing them to wait for years and even decades in line for housing. We need to create the possibilities for the bulk of the working population to buy housing on the market, while at the same time ensuring that low-income groups have access to social housing. The government, regional and local authorities should work towards having at least a third of the population (and not a tenth, as is currently the case) able to buy housing that meets modern standards by 2010. They will buy housing through their own savings and with the help of mortgage schemes. This means that mortgage schemes must become long-term and affordable for people. In order to prevent the situation when increased demand for housing pushes up prices competitive conditions for housing construction need to be ensured. What are the steps we need to take here? They are basically well-known. I will name them now. First, we need to put in place financial mechanisms that will enable people to improve their housing conditions not just through their current earnings and their savings, but also through their future earnings. We need to develop clear legal conditions for long-term mortgage schemes, conditions that will apply to citizens and to the construction companies. Mortgages should become an affordable solution for people in the middle income group. Of course, we should also develop other forms of financing such as having future homeowners buy a stake in a building’s construction or take part in housing savings programmes. For all this to work, we also must ensure that we have an effectively functioning state system for registration of real estate rights, a credit history bureau and a developed market for mortgage securities. These are the things to be done. Second, we need to put an end to the monopolies on the construction markets. Russia’s people are not obliged to pay the cost of the administrative barriers created in the construction sector or to ensure the excess profits of monopolist construction companies. What is needed are measures to reduce construction time and the expenses involved – clear-cut rules of municipal land use and construction , simplified procedures for getting all the approvals needed for construction and preparation of the necessary engineering and utilities infrastructure. Third, guaranteed ownership rights for honest buyers of real estate is a question of principle importance. Real estate deals should be handled through transparent, comprehensible and, also important, inexpensive procedures. Finally, we must bring order to provision of social housing. Contracts of social renting must become available to those who really need it. Furthermore, we should come up with additional measures to provide targeted support to individual categories of people, in particular young families. Some steps have already been taken in this direction but it is far from sufficient so far. We must increase our efforts in this area. * * *Now, a few words about healthcare modernisation. This is not the first time we have discussed this subject, but transformations in this area are taking place at a sluggish rate and have not brought any significant results so far. Russia lags behind many countries today in its basic healthcare situation. Life expectancy in Russia is 12 years lower than in the United States, eight years lower than in Poland and five years lower than in China. This is due above all to a high mortality rate among working-age people. Child mortality is decreasing but is still 1.5–2 times higher than in the developed countries. One of the main reasons for this situation is the country’s ineffective healthcare system. Throughout the entire system, the quality and accessibility of medical services continue to drop today, while costs keep rising. Guarantees of free healthcare assistance are often declarative. People still do not know what they are entitled to for free and what they must pay for themselves. The people with the lowest incomes have found themselves in the most difficult situation of all. They are forced to spend a large share of their already modest incomes on medical treatment and even end up unable to afford basic medicines, which is absolutely unacceptable. The main aim of modernising the Russian healthcare system is to ensure affordable and good-quality healthcare for broad sections of the population. This means above all that guaranteed free healthcare services should be clear and known to all. Medical treatment standards should be drawn up and approved for each type of illness, along with an obligatory list of treatment and diagnostic procedures and the minimum requirements for healthcare provision. These standards should be applied in every city, town and village in the Russian Federation, and patients should have to pay only for additional medical services and for extra comfort. Having an itemised list of standards will make it possible to calculate the real cost of these services and move away from the system of funding medical establishments based on estimates of their demands, to funding based on the amount and quality of healthcare services they actually provide. Healthcare services should be paid for in accordance with the principles of compulsory medical insurance. At the same time, incentives should be created to encourage the development of voluntary medical insurance. The government and the parliament must ensure the legal framework for compulsory medical insurance, state-guaranteed medical services, private medical practice and for provision of fee-paying services. * * *The next priority is to develop the Russian education system. I want to emphasise that Russian education, with its fundamental approach to learning, held and still holds a leading place in the world. It would be absolutely unacceptable to lose this advantage. The global competitive environment demands of us that we strengthen the practical component of our higher education system. This means, above all, placing higher demands on professional education, professional in the broad sense of the word. Professional education today is not firmly bound to the situation on the labour market and more than half of higher education graduates do not find work in the professions in which they got their degrees. More and more people are going into higher education, but at the same time the level of teaching is falling. Compared to the Soviet period the number of people entering higher education has tripled and is now practically the same as the number of secondary school graduates. Who benefits from this situation? And even with this number of university graduates, we still face a shortage of desperately needed qualified specialists. One of the most serious problems is the lack of access to quality education for low-income groups. College studies involve additional costs that not all people can afford. The drop in the number of student residences and the small student allowances mean that children from low-income families, especially from remote towns and villages, are cut off from getting quality education. But the results of reforms in this sector should be evaluated by the quality of education, its accessibility and its relevance to the labour market’s demands. In this respect I want to name the following target criteria. First, secondary-school graduates, no matter what the financial situation of their families, should have the opportunity to enter higher education in accordance with their level of knowledge. This will require an absolutely transparent and objective system of evaluating knowledge to enter college, reviving on large-scale preparatory departments at the universities, and targeted provision of student allowances. Young people who live far away from prestigious universities should have the opportunity to take these universities’ entrance exams. Second, we should aim at having the majority of graduates working in the professions for which they got degrees. Of course, this does not mean a return to the old system of allocating jobs from above to graduates. Rather, it is about forecasting the country’s demand for the specialists it needs. I think we could also consider a system where students can sign a contract under which they receive free education and then have to either work a certain amount of time in the professions for which they got degrees or else reimburse the money the state spent on their education. This system should begin with the professions in short supply today. I also think that it is in the interests of Russian business to take part in training the specialists the economy needs through making use of education loans. This practice already exists and we should make more active use of it. Third, we need to introduce education standards that meet today’s demands. Furthermore, the content of our education should measure up to the highest world standards. At the same time we must not forget about the areas in which we have built up our own achievements and we should ensure maximum development of these areas in which Russian education meets or even surpasses world requirements, and we do have such areas. We must also go further in integrating education and research activities. Advancing research in universities and major academic centres should be a priority objective. * * *Dear colleagues, Ensuring affordable and accessible healthcare and education and giving people the possibility of buying housing will help alleviate the problem of poverty. We currently have around 30 million people who earn less than the subsistence level. That is a huge figure, it being known that most of the poor people in this country are people of working age. It is evident, that the state and the business community should direct their efforts at continuing to create jobs, especially in regions with persistent unemployment. They should also focus on developing small and medium-sized business and on effective use of targeted social assistance. But only economic growth can provide a genuinely reliable foundation for long-term solutions to social problems, including the struggle against poverty. As was said last year, we are entirely capable of doubling our economic potential over ten years. We can achieve this if we maintain average growth rates at least at the level we had over the first quarter of this year. Furthermore, if we maintain this kind of growth, we can hope to double our per capita GDP not in ten years time, but by 2010. The members of the government are also applauding – this means they agree. An essential condition for ensuring a rapid rate of development is to complete the transformations currently taking place in many sectors of the economy and the social sphere. * * *Now I would like to say a few words on budget reform. The main principle of reform is to move from managing budget expenses to managing results. Overall, the government must develop a system for evaluating the plans and results of work of all the executive power bodies and only on this basis should it then sum up results, draw conclusions and make policy adjustments in each area. Clearly set policy objectives and expected results should form the basis for the budget and its long-term planning. The independence the recipients of budget funds have in how they dispose of the allocated money should go hand in hand with responsibility for the results of their work. I particularly want to emphasise that achieving an optimum level of state spending should be a basic principle of our economic policy. We do not have such a lot of money to spend. The government must above all carry out restructuring of the huge network of budget-funded institutions that sprout up all around the country and change procedures for their financing and in many cases even change their status. This brings me to another very important issue. There are currently more than 35,000 federal state institutions in the country, many of which exercise control and supervision functions. These institutions often force their “services” – expert examinations, consultations and other – on business and individuals. This year, the government should revoke the powers of those institutions that are not part of the state management system. Moreover, state functions that have been declared superfluous should not be revived at regional and municipal level. Steps also must be taken to bring order to state and municipal property. I have already said that each level of state power should only have the property that it needs to exercise its designated public functions, and no more than that. This should be kept in mind as ministries’ functions are cut back further. We should also be ready to introduce a new distribution of revenue collection powers and spending commitments between the different levels of the country’s budget system. The regions and the municipalities should know exactly which functions they are supposed to exercise and which public services they are responsible for. And also, they need to know where the funding for these services will come from. Finally, we need to clearly set and delimit each level of power’s responsibilities for providing social assistance to the population. All the country’s regions are directly concerned by the problems of ensuring affordable housing, education and healthcare. It would be only right then to actively involve them in drawing up the legal framework and the measures for practical implementation of the social programmes package, taking into account the division of powers between the different levels of state power. All of these measures should result in a renewed system of inter-budget relations and increased independence and responsibility for the regions and the municipalities. I am aware of the regions’ and municipalities’ concerns regarding these questions. I hope that the government and the members of both houses of parliament will listen to these concerns, weigh up all the pros and cons and find solutions that are in keeping with the demands of the times and the economy. * * * Carrying out budget reform will in its turn make it possible to continue changes in the tax sphere. Over the last four years, serious steps have been made here. They have already begun to bring results – tax collection has increased, tax evasion has decreased, and the tax burden on the economy has dropped. But, of course, far from everything has been done.And to move to an effective tax system, we need in the next two years to pass and implement a series of additional decrees.How should the tax system look after reform is completed?First, it should not be burdensome for business, neither by the level of tax rates, nor in the procedures of calculation and payment of taxes, regulation of tax checks and tax accounts.Second, it should be fair for all economic agents. Taxation conditions should be equal for enterprises that work in the same sphere. Tax structure must exclude opportunities for tax evasion. Third, the tax system in Russian remains excessively oriented toward the fiscal function, to the detriment of other functions, above all the function of stimulating the growth of competitiveness. And here, the Russian tax system should become more favourable for investment and the development of business – more favourable than in competing countries. It should have itself sustainable competitive advantages.To continue. The government has on several occasions raised the issue about the necessity to reduce the single social tax. We should bring a considerable percentage of work salaries out of the “shadows”, protect the social rights of employees and stimulate citizens’ concern for their own retirement pensions, thus reducing the burden on business.Another problematic issue is value-added tax. Besides changing the procedure for levy of value-added tax, we need to further reduce tax rates, solve the issue of timely compensation of value-added tax on export operations, and in making capital investments, and also to finally put a stop to taxation of advance payments. Finally, it is important to distinguish the lawful practice of tax optimization from cases of criminal tax avoidance. I would like to stress that stability of budget and tax policy is a very important factor in the development of the economy. This stability, however, is not able to solve all the uncertainty of economic conditions in doing business. A balanced macroeconomic policy is needed. We need to continue what has been formed in the economy in recent years, namely a policy of gradually reducing inflation to 3% a year. And to create the necessary conditions to ensure full convertibility of the ruble over the next two years. We know about the laws passed in this sphere. We know that the Government and the Central Bank have set themselves this task. But they have made easier conditions for themselves – by 2007. It is quite possible to work faster now.We should also create an effective system of using natural resources. We need transparent, non-corrupt conditions of access to them, for example, with the use of auctions. We need to move from administrative permits to full agreements – with a clear determination of the rights and responsibility of both the state and entrepreneurs. We need to ensure predictability and stability in these relations.The system of resource payments also requires changes. It should provide equal conditions of competition both within the extractive sector, and between the extractive and processing industries. And it should also ensure rational use of natural resources.I expect that the new Forestry codex and the Law on mining will answer all these questions.* * *Dear Assembly,Among the most important tasks that the country faces, I would like to single out another one especially – the development of transport infrastructure. When we take into account the size of Russia and the geographic remoteness of certain territories from the political and economic centres of the country, I would say that the development of infrastructure is more than an economic task. Solving it will not just directly affect the state of affairs in the economy, but ensure the unity of the country as a whole – whether people feel they are citizens of a united, large nation, and whether they can make use of its advantages.Today, the poor condition and low density of the road network, oil pipelines, the gas-transport system and the infrastructure of the power industry puts serious restrictions on the development of the Russian economy. Factories cannot function normally if it is impossible to supply goods quickly and inexpensively. The undeveloped road and port infrastructure has already become an obstacle for export, as it is unable to cope with the growing volume of goods. And it is quite clear that with Russia’s climatic conditions and extensive territory, infrastructural expenses make up a significant portion of the cost of many kinds of goods and services. At the same time, a modern, well-developed transport infrastructure is capable of turning Russia’s geographical features into a real competitive advantage for the country.What needs to be done to achieve this? Above all, we need to unite the economic centres of the country, to provide economic subjects with unhindered access to regional and international markets, and at the same time to provide infrastructure services of a world standard.The Government should find effective mechanisms of controlling quality and expenses in building new objects. In order to radically change the situation we need to create a competitive environment.At the same time, the state must control the development of the country’s infrastructure for a long time to come – I am convinced of this. Still, private investment will also make an important contribution to creating a branched transport infrastructure of high quality and reliability. However, for private capital, it is very important that the state have definite plans. From this viewpoint, the Government must announce its plans and projects, and the conditions to implement them. Such projects exist, and they need to be completed quickly. I will mention several of them.For example, there are plans in the oil sector to diversify delivery of Russian oil. These plans are well-known. They involve expanding the capacity of the Baltic pipe system, opening the Western Siberia – Barents Sea pipelines, determining routes from oilfields in Eastern Siberia, bypassing the Bosporus and Dardanelle Straits, and integrating the Druzhba and Adriya oil pipelines.However, this is not the first year that the Government has been unable to sort out its priorities. And a solution to this issue is, quite frankly, long overdue. I would note that the guidelines for passing the necessary decisions should be the realization of national tasks, and not the interests of individual companies.As for the gas transport system, here we need first of all to develop the gas distribution network within the country – including expansion of the system to the east of Russia. In export, construction of the North European gas pipeline is most important. It will make it possible to diversify export flows, directly linking the networks of Russia and countries of the Baltic region with the total European gas network.For Russia, modernization of roads is also important – not just roads that link the country’s main economic centres, but also those used for transit. The basic network of roads needs to be gradually directed towards integration into the total European road network, and — through the Trans-Siberian corridor — into the road network of the Far East region. Another project is construction and reconstruction of highways in the North-South corridor. Something is already being done here, and this work needs to be continued.These projects will make it possible to ensure inter-regional and transit flows on the main international transport routes. And, what is also important, to develop the territories which are next to these routes. And finally, we have been talking about toll roads for a long time. I think that we need to begin realizing these projects on the main routes – of course, along with the existing free roads. The Government should determine a list of them very soon.* * *Undoubtedly, modernization of the army is a task of national importance. We need effective, well-equipped and modern Armed Forces for reliable protection of the country. So that we can easily solve internal socio-economic tasks.We should secure our country from any forms of military and political pressure and potential foreign aggression. And thus modernizing the Russian Armed Forces remains a very important task, including equipping strategic nuclear forces with the most modern systems of strategic armaments. We have everything needed for this. And also, we need to equip other types of the Armed Forces with the appropriate tactical and operational weapons. I would like to note once more: an adequate quality of weapons is the characteristic that directly determines the degree of battle readiness of a modern army.We are also beginning reform of social support guarantees for soldiers. A mortgage programme will be created for them. Three years after joining this programme, a soldier will be able to receive housing on mortgage conditions.I also think that military education for training specialists in unique professions that are required by a modern army can also be provided at civil institutes of higher education. I would like to stress: for successful modernization of the entire military system of the state, we need to know precisely how considerable sums of money – including those for housing, military medicine and education – are spent. Furthermore, the army and other law-enforcement institutions have an enormous amount of property. And this also needs to be accounted for and managed effectively. A transparent military economy is the necessary condition for reform. All these steps should be targeted at increasing the prestige and attractiveness of military service.I would like to remind the Defence Ministry and the Government as a whole: the volumes of funds spent, the interests of the country’s defensive capacity, and also the important social parameters of reform make civil control over the effectiveness of changes in the army essential.* * *Dear colleagues,The growth of the economy, political stability and the strengthening of the state have had a beneficial effect on Russia’s international position. We have been able to a significant degree to make our foreign policy both dynamic and pragmatic.It is clear that the scale of the tasks that the country faces has now changed substantially. And we need to make our foreign policy adequate to the goals and scope of the new stage of development. In other words, we need to use the tools of foreign policy for a more appreciable practical return in the economy, and in the realization of important national tasks.Work on deepening integration in the Commonwealth of Independent States remains our priority, especially within the framework of the Common economic space, and the Eurasian economic community. This, without exaggeration, is one of the conditions of regional and international stability.I am certain that the CIS should work effectively for the benefit of citizens of our countries. It should work by ensuring maximum openness of economies, and by removing barriers to mutual trade and information flows, business and social initiatives, and direct contact between people.We are interested in further integration of the Russian economy into the international economy, including joining the WTO on conditions that are beneficial for us. Increasing competitiveness on international markets stimulates developed countries to increase support of their manufacturers and exports. The Russian Interior Ministry and the Government as a whole need to find more effective ways to increase Russian export, and to provide reliable protection of the interests of Russian companies abroad.This approach is particularly important now, when the Russia and the EU are already immediate neighbours. The expansion of the European Union should not just bring us closer geographically, but also economically and spiritually. I am certain that this is a prerequisite of success, not just for Russian, but for all European business. This means new markets and new investment. Generally, it means new possibilities for the future of Greater Europe.We will continue to develop political and economic dialogue with the U.S.A. and with such major partners as China, India and Japan, and we will work with other countries. Border and interregional cooperation are also a significant reserve of development of trade and economic, cultural and humanitarian ties. It is clear that a necessary condition for solving these tasks is the effective security of Russia, and the inviolability of its borders. And an adequate response to the most serious threats of the 21st century – international terrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, regional conflicts – can only be provided by the united efforts of the international community, relying on the tools of the UN and international law.Terrorism threatens the human rights and lives, destabilizes nations and entire regions of the world, and stands in the way of economic and social progress. And today, international terrorists continue to commit acts of violence and murder of peaceful citizens. They attempt to provoke chaos and destabilize the situation in various regions of the world. And Russia, unfortunately, is no exception here.Despite such acts of provocation – including the recent political murder of the leader of Chechnya and the attempt to disrupt the work of legally elected bodies of power in the republic – our policy in fighting terror remains unchanged and consistent. No one and nothing will stop Russia on the path to consolidating democracy, and ensuring human rights and freedoms.We will continue to work on developing internationally recognized instruments of law and collective mechanisms of neutralizing global threats. I consider the task of strengthening the anti-terrorist coalition to be one of the most important.At the same time, I would like to note that no excuses about the necessity of fighting terrorism can be an argument for restricting human rights, or for creating unjustified difficulties in contact between people on the international stage. To conclude the topic of foreign policy, I would like to stress: Russian society should see the practical results of our work in the international sphere. They are ensuring safety of the individual, increasing possibilities for enterprise, and effective protection of the rights of Russian nationals abroad. I expect that in cooperation with the Federal Assembly, we will be able to work even more productively in all the areas mentioned.* * *Dear deputies of the State Duma, members of the Federation Council,Keeping to the strategic policy, continuing changes – those that have already been tested by the practice of the last four years – is the basis of our further stable development. At the same time, the only source and bearer of power in the Russian Federation is its multiethnic people. And only the people – through the institutions of the democratic state and civil society – have the right and are able to guarantee the stability of the moral and political foundations of the country’s development for many years to come.At the same time, we must make a critical assessment of the state of our democracy.Is the political system in its present state a tool of real sovereignty of the people? And how productive is dialogue between the authorities and society?It is clear that young Russian democracy has had considerable success in establishing itself. And those people who do not notice this success, or who do not want to notice it, are not quite honest. But our social system is still far from perfection. And it must be admitted: we are at the very beginning of the path.Without a mature civil society, an effective solution to peoples’ daily problems is impossible. The quality of their daily life directly depends on the quality of the social and political system. And here, of course, we still have many questions. I would like to remind you: any power above all means great responsibility. It is unacceptable when civilised political competition is replaced with a self-interested fight for status revenue. When the financial side of the activity of political groups is still hidden from society. When election technologies and lobbyist services is primarily oriented towards the shadow sector. And all this takes place against the background of the dreary monotony of most party programmes. I would like to say a few words about the role of non-political public organisations. In our country, there are thousands of public associations and unions that work constructively. But not all of the organisations are oriented towards standing up for people’s real interests. For some of them, the priority is to receive financing from influential foreign foundations. Others serve dubious group and commercial interests. And the most serious problems of the country and its citizens remain unnoticed.I must say that when violations of fundamental and basic human rights are concerned, when people’s real interests are infringed upon, the voice of such organisations is often not even heard. And this is not surprising: they simply cannot bite the hand that feeds them. Of course, such examples cannot be grounds for us to make accusations against civil groups as a whole. I think that these problems are unavoidable, and of a temporary nature.To reduce these problems and stimulate the further growth of institutions of civil society, we do not need to invent anything new. Our own experience and international experience has already proved the productiveness of an entire range of approaches. It is necessary to gradually transfer to the non-governmental sector functions which the state should not or is unable to perform effectively.It is also worth using the experience of public boards that has been gained in a number of Russian regions. These permanent non-governmental organisations can provide independent examination of important normative documents. Documents that directly concern citizens’ interests. Political parties should also work more closely with public structures. Direct contact with people and society will help to improve the quality of people’s representation at all levels. And parties should be interested in expanding their ranks, consolidating the material base, and the intellectual and staff potential. They should actively create groups in regional parliaments, and participate in the work of bodies of local self-administration.Parties should increase their level of political culture, and learn the skills of inter-party dialogue and coalition activities. They should learn to come to power and leave it by the will of the people.I will stress once more: any radical re-examination of economic policy, any restrictions on the rights and freedoms of citizens, a cardinal change in foreign policy guidelines – any divergence from the historic path chosen by Russia, a path that I even would say has been gained by suffering – may lead to irreversible consequences. And they must be absolutely ruled out.* * *Dear friends,Today I have talked about the most important national tasks. I believe that creating a free society of free people in Russia is our most important task. But it is also the most difficult.It is the most important task because people who are not free or independent are incapable of looking after themselves, their families, or their countries. It is the most difficult because freedom is not always valued and even more rarely used properly. Creative energy, enterprise, a sense of proportion and a will to victory cannot be introduced by decree, cannot be imported, and cannot be borrowed.In aiming for a growth in citizens’ prosperity, we will continue to maintain and stand up for the democratic achievements of the Russian people. We will consolidate the security of the state and strive for civilised solutions to key issues of world politics, founded on international law. In this I count on the constructive cooperation of all branches and all levels of power.I count on the support and solidarity of all citizens of Russia.I count on their faith in themselves. In their abilities. In the success of our country.Thank you for your attention.",2004
"MoscowPresident Vladimir Putin:Esteemed colleagues, deputies of the State Duma, members of the Federation Council, citizens of Russia! Today, in accordance with the Constitution, I have come to report to you on the state of the nation. I would like to begin with a brief summing up of the situation. Last year’s results are in many ways a continuation of the work begun three years ago. Over these last three years not only have we worked hard to clear the mountain of problems that life itself forces us to tackle practically on a daily basis, we have also achieved some positive results. Now we must take the next step and focus all our decisions and all our action on ensuring that in a not too far off future, Russia will take its recognised place among the ranks of the truly strong, economically advanced and influential nations. This is an entirely new challenge we must take up, and it represents an entirely new stage in our country’s development. We could not take up this challenge earlier because we faced a great number of more urgent problems that we had to tackle first. But now we have this new opportunity in our hands and we must use it. Russia must become and will become a country with a flourishing civil society and stable democracy, a country that fully guarantees human rights and civil and political freedoms. Russia must become and will become a country with a competitive market economy, a country that gives reliable protection to property rights and provides the economic freedoms that allow its people to work honestly and make money without fear and limitations. Russia will be a strong country, a country with modern, well-equipped and mobile Armed Forces able to defend our nation and its allies and protect the national interests of our state and its citizens. Through all of this, we will create the conditions for people to enjoy a decent life and enable Russia to take its place as an equal in the community of most developed nations. Not only will people feel proud of such a country, they will strive to multiply its wealth. They will remember and respect our great history. This is our strategic objective. But if we are to achieve this objective, we must consolidate, we must mobilise our intellectual forces and unite the efforts of the state authorities, civil society and all the people of this land. We must set out a programme of clear and comprehensible objectives that we will use to achieve the consolidation we need if we are to resolve the major national problems we face. Why do I think this of such vital importance? Our entire historical experience shows that a country like Russia can live and develop within its existing borders only if it is a strong nation. All of the periods during which Russia has been weakened, whether politically or economically, have always and inexorably brought to the fore the threat of the country’s collapse. Yes, certain of our achievements over these last years make it possible to speak of stabilisation. Some people even have the impression that all our problems have now been solved, that Russia now has a perfectly bright and predictable future ahead of it, and that everything now is just a question of whether the economy should grow by four or by six percent a year, and of how much we should spend. I would like to say that this is not the case. We face serious threats. Our economic foundation has become more solid, but it is still not stable enough and still very weak. Our political system remains insufficiently developed and our state apparatus is not very effective. Most sectors of our economy are not competitive. Meanwhile, our population continues to fall and the fight against poverty is progressing far too slowly. The international situation remains complicated and competition in the world economy is as intense as ever. All around us are countries with highly developed economies. We need to look in the face the fact that these countries push Russia out of promising world markets when they have the chance. And their obvious economic advantages serve as fuel for their growing geopolitical ambitions. The proliferation of nuclear weapons continues in our world today. Terrorism threatens the world and endangers the security of our citizens. Certain countries sometimes use their strong and well-armed national armies to increase their zones of strategic influence rather than fighting these evils we all face. Can Russia have any real hope of standing up to these threats if our society is splintered into little groups and if we all busy ourselves only with the narrow interests of our particular group? And if instead of becoming a thing of the past parasitic moods are only growing? And what is helping feed these moods but a bureaucracy that instead of trying to look after and build up our national wealth often happily lets it get frittered away. It is my conviction that without consolidation at the least around basic national values and objectives, we will not be able to withstand these threats. I would like to recall that throughout our history Russia and its people have accomplished and continue to accomplish a truly historical feat, a great work performed in the name of our country’s integrity and in the name of bringing it peace and a stable life. Maintaining a state spread over such a vast territory and preserving a unique community of peoples while keeping up a strong presence on the international stage is not just an immense labour, it is also a task that has cost our people untold victims and sacrifice. Such has been Russia’s historic fate over these thousand and more years. Such has been the way Russia has continuously emerged as a strong nation. It is our duty never to forget this, and we should remember it now, too, as we examine the threats we face today and the main challenges to which we must rise. The results we have achieved through our common efforts over these last three years show that we can rise to these challenges. Yes, we have already managed to deal with a good many of our problems, including some that only recently seemed impossible to resolve. We have finally re-established the unity of our country, in law and in fact. We have reinforced state authority and brought federal power closer to the regions. Having re-established a common legal space, we were able to turn our attention to the division of powers between the federal and regional authorities. There is still a lot do here, but at least we are now hard at work on this issue. We have begun work on building up effective local authorities that have the financial resources to do their jobs. I choose my words carefully here, as we have only just begun addressing this task. The adoption of the third part of the Russian Civil Code marked an important stage in our work on codifying our laws. The new Labour Code has also been passed. Modernised legislation and ongoing dialogue with trade unions and employers are now beginning to shape a civilised labour market. We have made great strides towards creating a genuinely independent court system. We have adopted the new Criminal Procedural, Civil Procedural and Arbitration Procedural Codes, thereby assuring additional guarantees for human rights. We have improved the electoral system. We now have the conditions we need for the development of a real civil society, and also for the establishment of genuinely strong political parties. We have made considerable headway in tax reform and have begun military reform. We have managed to make progress on the complex issue of reforming land relations, a matter that had been at a standstill. I would just like to remind you that for a whole decade this question was a serious economic obstacle on the road to democracy and the market. We have taken the first steps towards reforming the pension system, the infrastructure monopolies and the housing and utilities sector. Together we have overcome an absolutely unacceptable situation in which certain parts of the country had for all intents and purposes placed themselves beyond the scope of federal jurisdiction. The supremacy of the Russian Constitution and federal laws, as well as the obligation to pay taxes to the national treasury have now become the norm for all the regions of the Russian Federation. I would like here to add a few important remarks on a subject that is sensitive for all of us. Last year’s address spoke of the need to reintegrate the Chechen Republic into the country’s political and legal space, of the need for free elections and the establishment of effectively functioning regional authorities in the republic. Frankly speaking, few people believed in these words at that time. Now a year has gone by and reality has proven to us that together we can achieve a great deal. Once again I would like to thank everyone who supported this policy we have pursued and who took an active part in it. And I of course wish to thank all those who helped organise the referendum on the constitution in Chechnya itself. I wish to express particular thanks to the people of Chechnya today. I thank them for their courage, for the fact that they did not let themselves be intimidated in the past and will not let themselves be intimidated today, and for that wisdom that is so inherent in people who are simple and yet always so sensitive to the truth. People in Chechnya felt in their hearts their responsibility and where their human interest lies. And finally, the referendum showed that the Chechen people rightfully considers itself an inalienable part of the united multi-ethnic community of peoples that make up Russia. It is true that we have had to pay a high price to restore Russia’s territorial integrity, and we bow our heads in memory of our fallen soldiers and of the Chechen civilians who lost their lives, in memory of all those who at the price of their lives did not allow this country to be torn apart and did their duty right to the end. The constitutional referendum marked the end of these troubled times in Chechnya, these years during which bandits grabbed power in the republic and the people found themselves literally thrown back into a medieval world in which they lost even their most basic human rights. These were times when public executions became regular events on the streets of Chechen towns and villages, when thousands of people became living goods in the hands of slave traders, and when neither schools nor institutes nor hospitals functioned. All of this is over now.But we still a great deal of work to do before life in Chechnya returns completely to normal. Now, on a democratic basis and in accordance with the constitution approved by the referendum, the Chechen people must elect a president and parliament for their republic and establish local government. We must draw up and sign an agreement on the division of powers between the federal and the Chechen authorities, and of course we must get the Chechen economy working again. We also have to transfer the organisation of law enforcement in Chechnya to the republic’s own police force. Also, as part of the ongoing process of political regulation, we are working together with you, esteemed colleagues, on preparing the ground for an amnesty that will pave the way back to peaceful life for those who for various reasons did not lay down their arms earlier, but who now wish to do so. We will face difficult conditions as we carry out this work. It is clear that what remains of the bandits will attempt to intimidate the people of Chechnya through threats, murders and terrorist acts and will try to disrupt and prevent the political regulation process that is gathering steam and moving ahead. We see today that the terrorist acts committed by these bandits are more and more often targeting the civilian population, ordinary people. But we will see our work through to the end and the people of Chechnya will live a normal life worthy of a human being. Respected Assembly, Three years ago we identified the biggest threats to Russia as being demographic decline, economic weakness and a state that did not function effectively. Have we made headway with solving these problems? Yes and no. We have had some successes, but there have also been some serious failures. Let us take an honest look at this today. One of the most serious threats we identified was the decrease in the Russian population due above all to a falling birth rate and rising mortality rate. The mortality rate has continued to rise over recent years. It has increased by 10 percent over the last three years. Life expectancy, meanwhile, has continued to fall. Statistics paint the unhappy truth, showing us that life expectancy fell from 67 years in 1999 to 64 years in 2002. The reasons for this low life expectancy include high levels of illness and deaths from accidents, poisoning and injuries. The spread of new epidemics including drug addiction and AIDS is only making the situation worse. On the positive side, the birth rate rose by 18 percent over the last three years, while infant mortality decreased by 21 percent and is now lower than at any other time in our history. At a recent meeting of the State Council we examined a whole range of issues related to speeding up the move to a system of medical insurance-based healthcare. I think this will considerably improve the financial situation in our healthcare system. During the second half of the year we will work through the organisational questions in 16 regions in the country, and from next year we will introduce medical insurance for pensioners throughout the entire country. I very much hope that this will provide some real support for our senior citizens. According to preliminary data from last year’s national census, the Russian population now numbers more than 145 million people. This is almost two million more than what ongoing statistics showed, but it is two million less than in 1989. What do these figures tell us?First, they show that our population is still falling, even if at a slower rate than what statistics had suggested. Second, though the birth rate has risen somewhat, additions to our population have come not so much from births as from legal migration. Over the last decade, around 7 million people have immigrated to Russia, mostly from the Commonwealth of Independent States countries. This is a significant result and it shows that despite the many problems we face, Russia remains an attractive country for millions of people looking to live and work here. Another of the serious issues that was named three years ago was the increasing globalisation of the economy and of public international life in general in the modern world. No country today, no matter how big and how wealthy, can develop successfully in isolation from the rest of the world. On the contrary, the biggest success comes to those countries that consciously use their energy and intelligence to integrate themselves into the world economy. We have taken some big steps forward on the road to international integration over the last three years. Above all, Russia was invited in June last year to become a full member of the G-8 group of the world’s most highly developed nations. Together with our partners in this group we work on safeguarding our own national interests and on finding solutions to the common problems that affect all of us in the modern world. One important example of this cooperation is the global partnership on non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Programs to dismantle, treat and process these weapons will help us improve the environmental situation in a number of Russian regions. I would like to note that our credit rating today is the highest it has been so far in new Russian history. A number of Russian companies have now joined the ranks of major European and world corporations. Some of these companies have, for the first time in the last 90 years, begun serious expansion into world markets, becoming visible players on the international economic stage and real rivals for foreign firms. We have also made a lot of progress towards joining the World Trade Organisation. Finally, Russia’s economic weakness was named as a real strategic challenge for the country three years ago. How far have we come since then in addressing that challenge? There have been positive changes over this period. Economic growth has continued. Gross domestic product rose by 20 percent over these three years. Investment in fixed capital increased by more than 30 percent. Our exports increased by more than a quarter in physical volume, and exports of cars, equipment, and means of transport rose by more than 70 percent in physical volume terms. Overall, this is a decent result. For the first time in the last fifty years, Russia went from importing grain to exporting it. Since 1999, exports of Russian foodstuffs have tripled. Exports of oil, petroleum products and gas rose by 18 percent, and Russia today is one of the world’s biggest energy exporters. Information technologies have developed at a fast pace. The new economy is on the increase in Russia with its output growing at a rate of 20–30 percent a year. The number of people in the country with telephones has gone up considerably, and the number of mobile phone users has doubled every year and has now reached almost 18 million. Estimates show that around 10 million people in Russia use the Internet. These figures show that it is possible for us to achieve balanced economic growth based on both traditional sectors and modern technologies. This growing economic potential has brought improvements to the lives of tens of millions of people. Thanks to this economic growth, almost four million people have left the ranks of the unemployed and found new jobs over these last years. The new opportunities to work and earn a living have also meant there have been fewer and not such large-scale strikes. Almost 900,000 people took part in strikes in 1997, while in 2002 that figure was down to less than 5,000. And this result has been achieved at a time when trade unions are becoming more, not less active. Real personal incomes have increased by 32 percent. Three years ago, the average pension came to 70 percent of the survival minimum set for pensioners, while last year it reached the survival minimum level. Finally, per capita consumption rose by almost a third over the last three years. Last year’s per capita consumption result was not just higher than that of the crisis year 1998, or than that of pre-crisis 1997, but was higher than at any time in Russian history. Of course, this list of dry figures might seem not very comprehensible, but I am sure that you understand what these figures mean. These results represent considerable resources that have become genuinely accessible for millions of our citizens. These resources have helped improve people’s living standards, given them better healthcare and made it possible to find solutions for the complex social problems the country faces. But at the same time, despite these positive changes, we are forced to admit that the economic results we have achieved are still very, very modest. First, we still have a quarter of our citizens with incomes below the survival minimum. A quarter of the country’s population! Second, our economic growth is still very unstable. In 2000, industrial output rose throughout the whole year, but in 2002, it showed an increase only for a total of six months and as a result, unemployment began to rise. Third, the economic growth rate is slowing down. In 2000, we enjoyed growth of 10 percent, but by last year the growth rate had slowed down to only slightly more than 4 percent. A lower growth rate inevitably also slows down the rate of social development and prevents us from resolving many of the other problems we face. We also must recognise that Russia owes its economic growth above all to the favourable world economic situation over recent years. An unprecedented improvement in foreign trade conditions for our economy gave Russia considerable economic advantages and brought in significant additional revenue. Part of this money was spent on improving living standards for the population. Part of it was invested in the Russian economy, and part of it went towards servicing our state foreign debt. We have reduced this debt by a quarter. Finally, these additional revenues also helped us build up our reserves, those of the Finance Ministry, the Central Bank, and the Central Bank’s own gold and currency reserves that have now reached a record figure of $61 billion after totalling only $11 billion three years ago. I think it is clear that without these revenues, without this favourable foreign economic situation, our social and economic development results would have been a lot more modest. And we must not forget that this kind of favourable economic situation cannot and will not last forever. In this respect I would like to draw your attention to another problem. The state’s total annual social spending commitments now come to 6.5 trillion roubles. This is almost double the country’s consolidated budget. Over the years, the executive and the legislative authorities have promised people far more than the Russian economy can actually deliver. What’s more, populist slogans and empty promises that mislead people and cheat their hopes are becoming more common. Unfortunately, some politicians are trying to add to them today, too. These kinds of empty promises do not just deceive people’s hopes; they have a negative impact on our whole ongoing economic policy and they create conflicts and distortions in inter-budgetary relations. It cannot be otherwise if state expenditure is growing at a faster pace than the economy itself. Esteemed members of both houses of the Federal Assembly and respected heads of the regions, I think it high time that we put an end to this kind of policy. The state cannot, must not and does not have the right to deceive its own people. If we have made a promise to the people, then we must deliver on that promise. Otherwise it is better not to make such promises in the first place. And one last matter, the state-regulated tariffs for the goods and services of the infrastructure monopolies are rising at a faster rate than are prices in the unregulated sector of the Russian economy. As a result, economic resource distribution is becoming skewed in favour of these monopolies, which account for an ever-increasing share in the economy. But these monopolies are inefficient, and their expansion is putting a stranglehold on competitive sectors of our economy. The government must take a firmer line on this question, for if this situation continues it will lead to stagnation. The conclusions we can draw from all I have just said are clear. There are some positive trends and results, but we have not made as full use as we could have of the favourable foreign trade situation and stable political environment to achieve our strategic aims. Esteemed deputies,Esteemed members of the Federal Assembly,The last three years have shown us what we really can achieve if we work together towards a common goal. These three years have shown us that Russia does not have to be fated to suffer crises and decay, and that the Russian people is full of talent, initiative and enterprising spirit, that our people know how to work, that they deserve a better life, and that they can achieve this better life if only we do not get in their way. At the very least we must not get in the way, and it would better still if we help. I think that our ultimate goal should be to return Russia to its place among the prosperous, developed, strong and respected nations. But this will only be possible when Russia gains economic power and when it no longer depends on the favours of the international financial organisations or on the unpredictable ups and downs of the foreign trade situation. We can achieve this kind of Russia only through sustainable and rapid growth, growth drawing on all factors, internal and external, traditional and modern, Russian and foreign. And finally, sustainable and rapid growth is only possible if we produce competitive goods. Everything we have must be competitive — goods and services, technology and ideas, business and the state itself, private companies and state agencies, entrepreneurs and civil servants, students and teachers, science and culture. But some people make an opposition between economic growth and reforms. They say it is dangerous to keep pushing economic growth, and that it is more important to carry out structural reforms. I would like to express my point of view on this question, which is that this opposition between growth and reform is debatable, to say the least. We do not need reforms purely for the sake of reform. We do not need a permanent revolution. It is clear that private initiative, both from Russian business and from foreign companies working in Russia, is the driving force of economic growth. It is also clear that Russian business must itself become modern, enterprising, flexible and mobile. It must become the worthy successor to the great traditions of Russian entrepreneurship, and some added patriotism would not go amiss. Again I repeat, our country’s success depends to a great extent on the successes of our businesspeople. Finally, there can be no opposition between a policy of pursuing economic growth and a social welfare policy. I would like to emphasise that we need economic growth above all in order to improve the living standards of our people. The solution to a whole range of vital problems depends directly on economic growth. This includes a quality diet, well-built and comfortable housing and reliable electricity and hot water supply. It also includes a good education and modern healthcare, protection from accidents and natural disasters, and finally, a longer life expectancy. We have said that intense competition is an inherent part of the modern world. And so our ability to compete and our readiness to fight for resources and influence directly determines the situation within the country and Russia’s authority in international affairs.This approach to the future of our development was heard and understood in Russian society.Virtually all influential political forces and Russian citizens agree that making our country genuinely competitive should be our top priority. Now we should aim to ensure that this goal is also an inherent part of the way our state, regional and local authorities carry out their practical work. But the Russian bureaucracy has proved itself poorly prepared to develop and implement the decisions our country needs today. At the same time, it has proved itself good at obtaining benefits and revenues through use of its powers and position. I spoke about this last year.We also talked about the problem of the ineffectiveness of the state three years ago, and stressed the fact that weakness of the state will cancel out the effects of economic and other reforms.The Russian bureaucracy today still has enormous power. But the quantity of power it has does not correspond to the quality. I must stress that to a large degree, this power has its source in nothing more than the superfluous functions of state bodies. Also, despite the enormous number of officials, the country has a severe personnel shortage. There is a shortage at all levels and in all structures of power, a shortage of modern managers and effective people. This is the background against which we must carry out the administrative reform that is vital to the country.As you know, the Government has carried out an inventory of the functions of ministries and departments. There are approximately 5,000 of them. What this inventory revealed, however, was that almost every department thinks its functions should not be reduced, but broadened, and at the expense of other adjoining departments.While the complexity of the task is understandable, and there are many difficulties, administrative reform has nevertheless dragged on for too long.Evidently, the Government needs help. Obviously, an additional political impulse is needed. Of course, it will be given.I think that the bureaucracy does not need to be convinced to become less greedy; it needs to be restricted by directive. The functions of state agencies must be radically reduced. Of course, this should be calculated very carefully. Otherwise, it seems we will not be able to solve this problem. We should base ourselves in this work on the inventory, which the governmental commission is now completing, and we should work in coordination with a series of decisions on division of powers between the different levels of authority, and on providing them with financial independence.At the same time, we must establish an effective working mechanism for dispute resolution between citizens and the state by improving administrative procedures and the corresponding legal framework.A few words on our socio-economic priorities. We often hear that the Russian economy does not need quality improvements and upheavals, and that there is no need for major national projects that provide serious step-by-step gains. We are told that it is quite enough to be consistent in pursuing the policies we already have, even if they do not bring the high growth rates that we all expect.I would like to say that if we take this kind of stand and shy away from making responsible choices (and we are not talking here of the kind of mammoth projects that were typical of the stagnation period) we will not be able to make swift and meaningful progress. But I think that the problem of making a real choice between sources of growth only arises if there is a specific task that must be solved.This task does exist, and is quite realistic, although also extremely complicated.Over the next decade, we must at least double our country’s gross domestic product. Doubling the GDP is a systematic task, and naturally a large-scale one. It requires profound analysis and specification of existing approaches to economic policies. But what we need above all else is once again the consolidation of political forces and society, the consolidation of all the authorities, a union of our best intellectual forces, the support of our social and political structures and the co-operation of parliament and the government. We need to search together for the best ways to solve this truly strategic and vitally important historical task for Russia.I am certain that Russia already has all the conditions to organise and carry out such tasks. The possibilities exist for truly embarking on the large-scale construction of a modern and strong economy and eventually building a state that will be competitive in every sense of the word.Another major task that we must solve together is achieving total convertibility of the rouble, both domestic and foreign convertibility for major as well as short-term transactions. I would remind you that Russia once had one of the strongest and most respected currencies in the world. The value of the “golden rouble” was equal to the value of the nation itself.To say it straight, Russia needs a rouble that will circulate freely on international markets. It needs a strong and reliable link with the international economic system.And Russia, now a full member of the G-8 group of most developed states in the world, is of course obliged to achieve this goal.Achieving this objective will be a great step towards Russia’s real integration in the world economy. And for the ordinary citizens of our country, it will mean in practice that when they travel outside Russia, it will be enough for them to take their passport and Russian roubles.Our tax policies should remain based on the primary principles of simple procedures for tax calculation, the enforcement of legal norms such as equal treatment of all those subject to taxation, and a sensible level of taxes.A few words on this topic. Tax reforms in Russia are unfortunately becoming a constant and ongoing process. Yes, the measures proposed by the Government to reduce the tax burden are of course a move in the right direction. But the frequency of amendments to tax legislation clearly exceeds the allowable level. Let us put it bluntly – this reflects the quality of work. It shows the quality is low. It makes it difficult for everyone to plan their lives – the state, entrepreneurs and citizens.Now the Government has for the first time moved from yearly planning to medium-term planning in tax policies. Recently, a program was approved for tax amendments for the next three years. This is of course a correct, important and necessary step.Now we need to move on and develop the outlines of a tax system that will exist in Russia for many years.I would like to mention another very important matter that affects an enormous number of people – the problem of citizenship.Currently, over a million people who came to Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union and before the new law on citizenship was passed have found themselves in an extremely difficult situation. We recently discussed this subject with the leaders of the State Duma factions.These people who came to Russia have lived and worked in this country, taken part in its political life, and many of them have served in the Russian army. And now they are persons without citizenship in their own country.The laws passed last year were designed to bring order to migration flows and make them transparent. What we have ended up with does not help to solve these tasks, but rather creates serious problems for a large number of people. I consider it our duty to fix this situation. I agree with the faction leaders on this issue. Let us think about this and make the appropriate amendments.We do not need bans and obstacles; we need an effective immigration policy. One that is advantageous for the country and convenient for people, particularly for residents of the Commonwealth of Independent States. For people who are close to us and with whom we have a good understanding, and with whom we share the same language. These are people of our common Russian culture.Esteemed colleagues!Russia strives to support and will continue to support friendly, good neighbourly relations with all countries, and will work together with them to solve common problems and protect common interests.The main task of Russian foreign policy is to advance and safeguard our national interests. Here, the basic principle remains observance of the provisions of international law.The events of the last year have once more shown that in looking after our national interests, both effective diplomacy and a reliable defence potential are equally important to Russia.In the modern world, relations between nations are to a large degree determined by the existence of serious real and potential threats on an international scale. These threats include international terrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, regional and territorial conflicts, and the drug threat.At the same time, it is extremely important that if a certain threat intensifies – for the international community as a whole or for an individual country – that an understandable, transparent and universally acknowledged decision-making mechanism exists. Undoubtedly, the most important such mechanism we have is the United Nations and its Security Council.Yes, decisions at the Security Council are not always easy to make. And sometimes they are not made at all. It can happen that the initiators of a certain resolution simply do not have enough arguments to convince the other parties that they are right. Decisions by the UN, naturally, are not always to everybody’s liking. But the international community does not have any other such mechanism, and especially not one as universal, and so we need to protect the mechanism we have. Of course, it is vital to modernise and increase the effectiveness of international organisations. And Russia is open to discuss such issues. I think that such policies regarding international affairs are civilised and correct. These policies are not directed against anyone or for anyone. This is our position. It is a position of principle. And we will continue to hold to it in the future.Russia was one of the first countries to confront the major threat of international terrorism. As we all know, quite recently it threatened the very territorial integrity of the Russian Federation. After the notorious tragedies caused by terrorist acts, the world formed an anti-terrorist coalition. This coalition was set up with active participation and in cooperation with the United States of America, and other countries. The operations in Afghanistan were an example of just how effective this coalition can be combating the threat of terrorism.Russia values the anti-terrorist coalition. We value it as a tool to coordinate intergovernmental efforts in fighting this evil. Furthermore, successful co-operation within the coalition and within the framework of international law may become a good example of consolidation of civilised nations in fighting common threats.I repeat again, it is in Russia’s interest to have a stable and predictable world order. Only this can provide global and regional stability, and political and economic progress as a whole. It will assist the international war on poverty, one of the biggest challenges we face. Our undoubted priority in foreign policy remains strengthening relations with the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States. These countries are our closest neighbours. We are united by centuries of historical, cultural and economic ties. The interdependence of our development is also obvious. Among other things, tens of millions of Russians live in these countries.And to put it directly, we see the CIS area as the sphere of our strategic interests. We also assume that for CIS states, Russia is within the zone of their national interests. And our country wants to see stability and economic progress in the CIS area. I want to stress that the economic integration process taking place in the CIS is bound up with the integration of our countries into the world economy, and will help us carry out this integration more dynamically and in conditions that are more advantageous for all our partners. And we will consistently increase co-operation within a Eurasian economic community that works more and more effectively.Furthermore, events in the world confirm that our choice to create the Collective Security Agreement Organisation is correct and timely. In direct proximity to us, there are several sources of real, not imaginary threats – terrorism, trans-national crime, and drug trafficking. Together with our partners in the Collective Security Agreement Organisation, we must provide stability and security over a significant part of the area of the former Soviet Union.An important element of our foreign policy is growing closer and becoming truly integrated into Europe. Of course, this is a complex and lengthy process. But this is our historical choice. It has been made. It is gradually being realised, at the present stage through initiating bilateral relations, developing strategic partnership with the European Union, and active participation in the work of the Council of Europe.Together – in the interests of the citizens of Russia – we have found a political compromise on the problem of transit between the Kaliningrad Oblast and the rest of the territory of the Russian Federation.It is also obvious that our interests, and the interests of “Greater Europe” require that serious steps be made towards each other. This is in the interests of citizens, business, cultural and scientific societies both in European countries and in the Russian Federation. Our proposals for helping to develop these common European integration processes are well known and focus on ensuring the free movement of citizens, and creating a single economic space.This is not going to happen overnight. To achieve these goals, we will have to travel a complex and rather long path. But the dynamics of the integration processes at work in Europe make it possible for us to say that these plans are absolutely realistic. And they are actively supported by a great number of our partners in the European Union.I would now like to discuss the modernisation of our country’s military.The key issues in military reform include modernising arms and equipment, improving the way the Armed Forces is recruited and formed, and improving its actual organisation. A strong, professional and well-equipped army is essential for the prosperous and peaceful development of the country. This army should be capable of defending Russia and its allies, and also of co-operating effectively with the armed forces of other countries in fighting common threats.In accordance with the plans we have agreed on, we will continue to move towards a professional army, air force and navy. This transformation process will be completed in 2007. Interior Ministry and Border Guards forces will also move over to professional service. In plain and understandable language (this is not the only consequence, but it is a very important one), this means the following: in dangerous areas and local conflicts, if Russia should, God forbid, encounter these challenges, only trained and professional units will take part.I would also like to note that our Armed Forces will very soon move over to having a professional body of non-commissioned officers. From 2008, compulsory military service should be reduced to one year. New recruits will spend the first six months learning military skills at specialised military institutions. They will then have the choice of serving for another six months in line units or moving over to contract professional service. People who have served for three years under contract should receive a number of benefits, including the right to higher education at government expense.We have also decided to accept citizens from CIS countries for professional service in the Russian army. After a three-year contract service, they will receive the right to take Russian citizenship through a simplified procedure. Much of the above requires legislative authorisation. In this matter, I count on your support – on the support of the Federal Assembly.In the upcoming period, we must equip the Armed Forces with modern weaponry. As you know, a corresponding program to update equipment has been developed and approved, and will undoubtedly be carried out.A serious part of reforms to the armed forces will be consolidation and modernisation of our nuclear deterrent forces.As far as practical implementation of our plans go, I can inform you that work is also underway on creating new types of Russian weaponry, new generation weaponry. This includes what specialists have classified as strategic weapons. These weapons will ensure the defence capabilities of Russia and its allies in the long-term perspective.I repeat: the country needs an efficient army, an army with an intelligent officer corps and a highly qualified young command staff, an army with soldiers who truly have the desire and readiness to serve their Homeland. Esteemed deputies, Esteemed members of the Federation Council,Russia’s development prospects and the solution to many of our problems will to a large degree be determined by the results of the main political event of the year – the elections to the State Duma. I cannot ignore this very important event in the life of the country. It is an important step in the formation of our democracy.In recent years, relations between the executive and legislative branches have significantly improved. Instead of conflict, we have constructive cooperation based on substantial exchange of opinion and balanced criticism. We have interaction. I see the most important sign of the cultural recovery of our society as being the solidarity shown by politicians on issues such as the war on international terrorism, preserving the territorial integrity of the country and supporting our foreign policy efforts. I can say without exaggeration that I am truly grateful to these political figures of our country. And they are political figures of the most varied political orientation.I would also like to thank the representatives of all deputy organisations for their active collective work.At the same time, certain features of our national political life also cause concern. Above all, procedures for financing political parties are still “a deep dark secret” for voters. The market for election campaign and other political technologies is to a significant degree currently one of the sectors of the shadow economy. I hope that very soon our collective work will ensure a greater transparency of party life, and give people more objective information. And as a result, more chances to make the right choice.The lack of transparency of financial operations on the political stage are often accompanied by an incoherence of ideological position, and sometimes, quite frankly, a certain political insincerity. I will explain what I mean: sometimes deputies who are supposed to be liberals and supporters of progressive economic theories in practice vote for bills that are ruinous for the state budget. And they know what they are doing. And deputies who are not afraid of publicly calling entrepreneurs nothing but “robbers” and “blood-letters” shamelessly lobby the interests of large companies.Parliamentary parties are a part of the state political machine, and at the same time they are a part of civil society. I would say that they are the most influential part, and so the most responsible. We are all interested in furthering interaction of party structures with the regions and with citizens and public organisations.It is clear that active contact with the people cannot and must not be limited to pre-election debates and election campaigns. Only a daily link between the state and society, which can and must be provided by the large parties, can protect the government from making serious political errors.We often talk of the greatness of Russia. But a great Russia is not just a great state. It is above all a modern, developed society, which does not just arise by itself.A truly developed civil society only emerges when the functions of the state machine are radically reduced, and distrust between various social groups is overcome.But most importantly, this will only become possible if we can achieve the kind of national unity we need to examine and address the strategic tasks our country faces. This national unity is impossible to achieve without the active participation of political parties.I consider the upcoming elections to the State Duma as another step in the development of our multi-party system, the development of a greater openness of intentions, greater effectiveness of actions, and greater responsibility before the people of Russia.A strong and responsible government based on the consolidation of society is vital to preserve the country. Without strong power, it will also be impossible to move forward into the future.I would like to stress once again that we are facing serious problems and threats. And we need to be clever and strong to survive in the bitter competitive struggle in the world.But we must not merely survive. We must possess significant economic, intellectual, moral and military advantages. Only in this way will we maintain our position among the greatest powers on the planet. And I consider that our most important tasks, which I have already mentioned today and which I repeat, are the following:to double the gross domestic product;to overcome poverty;to modernise the Armed Forces.I think that our society is capable of achieving these results in the period up to 2010. I consider the basis for achieving these goals to be a consolidation of public forces, the solid foundation of the Constitution of the Russian Federation and guaranteed rights and freedoms of our citizens.I call on everyone who considers the above tasks to be a priority for the country to mobilise their intellectual forces, develop common approaches and agree on a program of action. I have already said that I support the general policy to strengthen the role of parties in public life. And taking into account the results of the upcoming elections to the State Duma, I think it will be possible to form a professional, effective government, supported by a parliamentary majority.To conclude my address, I would like to say that unification of our efforts is possible, if the main political forces take civil responsibility for collective work.I am certain that Russia will rise to a height that is worthy of its potential. The consolidation of all our intellectual, authoritative and moral resources will allow Russia to achieve the greatest goals.Great goals worthy of a great people.Let us wish one another success.Thank you very much for your attention.",2003
"MoscowPresident Vladimir Putin:Good afternoon, dear friends,Respected chairmen of the chambers of the Federal Assembly,Respected deputies of the State Duma, members of the Federation Council,We have gathered in this hall once more to sum up the results of the past year, and set tasks for the period ahead. Our goals are unchanged: the democratic development of Russia, the establishment of a civilized market and state of law. And most importantly, to raise the living standard of our people.There are achievements here, albeit small ones. Last year, economic growth continued. We were able to create new jobs. The number of unemployed dropped by 700,000. Citizens’ real income increased by almost 6%.A year ago, we set a modest but extremely important task – to ensure that the average pension in the country finally exceeded the minimum subsistence level for pensioners. Today we can say that this task has been solved.People look to the future with more confidence – many are beginning to make long-term personal plans, to receive education and new professions. And evidently, it is no coincidence that last year saw a record number of students in Russia.After a whole epoch of deficit budgets – when we spent more than we earned – the budget has made a profit for the second year in a row.There is progress in the development of market infrastructure, in consolidating guarantees of private property. This is mainly thanks to improvements in the legislative base. I note the passing of the Land and Labour codes, packages on pension and legal reform, the debureaucratisation of the economy, and the improvement of the tax system. New sections, and that of real importance for people, have appeared in the Civil code, such as the section on inheritance.And today, I want to thank the Federal Assembly and the Government of Russia, which cooperated constructively throughout this intensive period, and were often effective partners.As political stability increases, the business climate in the country is gradually improving. Horizons for state and corporate planning have moved. Entrepreneurs make their plans for years in advance, rather than months.We are paying off foreign debt in time, and sometimes even in advance. The summary capitalization of Russian companies has more than doubled. Export of non-raw materials has begun to increase. Supply of machines and equipment abroad has increased by a quarter over the last year. After a ten-year break, we have returned to the second place in the world in volumes of oil production, and to first place in the world in trade of energy resources. And we must intelligently make use of the country’s new position in the international economic community.All this is gradually changing the international attitude towards us. The improvement in the economic situation is noted by international ratings agencies, which raise Russia’s credit rating. Foreign banks increase the Russian share in their investment portfolios. Our country is gradually becoming a solid and predictable business partner.However, another thing should also be admitted: political stability and a favourable economic situation are not fully made use of to improve the standard of living for the citizens of our country, and to gain Russia a worthy place in the international economic system.Are we satisfied with what has been achieved?Our answer is no, of course not, not at all. There are no grounds to be “dizzy with success”. Russia’s economic problems, which built up over previous decades, decades of stagnation and crises, have not gone away. Poverty has dropped – only slightly – but continues to affect 40 million of our citizens. In the recent years of economic growth, we have only been able to avoid increasing the lag behind other countries.On this matter, I should say that for quite some time, many politicians and citizens in the country were certain, or lived under the illusion, that the end of the period of military and political confrontation in the world would almost automatically open Russia’s path to the international economic system, and that the world would “economically embrace us”. The reality proved to be much more complicated. Yes, the period of confrontation has ended. We are building constructive, normal relations with all the world’s nations – I want to emphasise, with all the world’s nations. However, I want to note something else: the norm in the international community, in the world today, is also harsh competition – for markets, for investment, for political and economic influence. And in this fight, Russia needs to be strong and competitive.Today, the countries of the world compete with each other in all economic and political parameters: in the size of the tax burden, in the security level of the country and its citizens, in guarantees for protecting property rights. They compete in the attractiveness of the business climate, in the development of economic freedoms, in the quality of state institutions and the effectiveness of the legal system.Competition has indeed become global. In the period of weakness – of our weakness – we had to give up many niches on the international market. And they were immediately occupied by others. No one wants to give them up just like that, and no one is going to, which is shown by the situation on the markets for oil, steel, air transport and other goods and services.The conclusion is obvious: in the world today, no one intends to be hostile towards us – no one wants this or needs it. But no one is particularly waiting for us either. No one is going to help us especially. We need to fight for a place in the “economic sun” ourselves.As I said before, Russia today needs more ambitious goals. It needs higher growth rates. And our economic policies, the daily work of our state institutions should be directed towards solving the according tasks. Furthermore, these actions, these policies should be understandable – understood and supported by the people.I am certain that to ensure a worthy living standard for our citizens, to ensure that Russia remains an important and full member of the international community, a strong competitor, our economy should grow at much faster rates. Otherwise we will keep losing out, and our capabilities in international politics and the world economy will be reduced. Is Russia ready for this competitive fight? Can it ensure the necessary growth rates for this? The government has predicted rates of 3.5% to 4.6% for the next few years. What does this show?First, this is essentially an admission that a favourable state of the foreign economy no longer ensures the necessary rates for the development of the economy and its competitiveness. And second, the Cabinet does not expect higher growth rates.Such a low assessment of Russia’s capabilities does not help much. What’s more, it does not lend itself to active policies. It does not envisage measures designed to make use of the capabilities of the Russian economy. This primarily concerns the potential possessed by enterprise, the scientific and technical sphere, and in modern administration technology.I believe that the main thing now is to create conditions under which citizens of Russia can earn money. To earn money and with benefit for themselves to invest in the economy of their own country.But to achieve this, it is necessary to remove the obstacles that still hinder people from living and working. And primarily, the actual work system of state institutions needs to be changed significantly.Today, the country’s colossal capabilities are blocked by an unwieldy, clumsy and ineffective mechanism of state. Incidentally, of the almost 500,000 appeals during the television interview, almost three quarters were complaints about various forms of administrative abuse.Dear Assembly,We are used to complaining about Russian bureaucracy, which is large and clumsy. And the complaints about it are fully justified. We repeat this very often. At the same time, strangely enough, there are not more bureaucratic structures in Russia than in other countries, and sometimes there are even less. What is the problem then?The main problem is not in the number of these structures, but that their work is badly organized. The current functions of the state mechanism are not adapted to solving strategic tasks. And it is still very rare for officials to know the modern science of administration.I have already spoken of the necessity for administrative reform. It should result in a state that is adequate to the time and the goal that our country faces. And the state mechanism should be effective, compact and efficient.What do we need to do to achieve this?First, we need to modernize the system of executive power as a whole. Today, divisions of executive power exist as if they were still headquarters for branches of a centralized economy. Enterprises have been privatized to a significant degree, but the old habits of management have remained. Ministries continue to direct their efforts to make enterprises and organizations subordinate to them, financially and administratively. As a result of these administrative problems, it is extremely difficult to do civilized business in this country.Meanwhile, the state’s direct responsibility is to create conditions for the development of economic freedoms, to set strategic guidelines, to provide high-quality public services for the people, and effectively manage state property.To achieve this, the structure of executive power should be logically and rationally organized, and the mechanism of state should become an effective tool for implementing state policies. Reforms of state service should be conducted in close coordination with updated principles of work and construction of executive power.Second, we need an effective and precise technology for developing, passing and implementing decisions. The system that currently exists is directed more towards form than contents.Third, we need to analyse the current functions of the state, and only keep the necessary ones.In last year’s Address, I already gave the according instructions to the Government, and asked to prepare for the launch of the administrative reform.It is clear that revising the functions of the state is a complex and long-term task. There can be no campaigning here. Campaigning which usually ends with officials moving from one structure to another.But we have been talking about reducing the excessive functions of the state mechanism for two years now. For quite understandable reasons, departments continue to “cling” to these functions. But this, of course, is no excuse to delay reforms.The Prime Minister should present valid proposals for restructuring the system of executive power.To conclude this topic, I would like to note that the current organization of the state mechanism’s work, unfortunately, enables corruption. Corruption is not the result of a lack of repression – I want to emphasise this – but the direct results of limiting economic freedoms. Any administrative barriers are overcome with bribes. The higher the barrier, the more bribes there are, and the more officials who take them.And we should not wait for the stability that has been achieved to turn into administrative stagnation due to the lack of transparency in the state mechanism’s work. For citizens, this remains a “black box”.We must determine a precise list of information which state bodies are obliged to make publicly accessible. And this list should be ratified by law. This is needed for both the development of civil society, and for forming a civilized entrepreneurial environment.Dear colleagues,We have made an important step towards modernizing the legal system. Most of the necessary decrees, documents and laws have already been passed. Means for their implementation have been allocated. Now we need to precisely implement the decisions that have been passed.I believe it important that the changes have not just affected the organisation and work conditions of courts, but above all the procedures ensuring the protection of individual rights and accessibility of justice.We need a court system that is respected in the country and outside it. And this is not just a political task, but also an economic task. An effective court system – I talked about this from the beginning – is needed so that Russian and foreign companies do not doubt the authority and effectiveness of this system.In July this year, the new Criminal procedure code comes into effect. In connection with this, legal and law-enforcement bodies should decide many organizational issues, so that beginning 1st of July this law works to the full. I appeal to the Federal Assembly to examine the necessary changes in the code and in the law on bringing it into effect, including the norms which concern transferring authority for arrests to courts.The civil and procedural, arbitration codes, and the law on arbitration courts, which are very important for the country’s people and economy, are also in line.I think that the structure of arbitration courts also needs to be optimized. Today disputes are settled and complaints are examined in the same court. I would ask you to pay attention to this issue.It is also necessary to clearly share the jurisdiction between arbitration courts and courts of general jurisdiction. The court system is simply discredited – many people know this – by the fact that the same dispute is often examined in different courts, which also often make contradictory decisions. This puts entrepreneurs and citizens at a loss, overburdens courts, and does not help to develop a healthy business climate.The statutes of the law “On the prosecutor’s office of the Russian Federation” also need to be brought into line with new legislative documents.And finally, it is very important for us to humanize the criminal legislation and the punishment system. Currently, the same sanctions are basically applied to crimes of minor and medium seriousness as to grave crimes. Crime does not go down because of this, and it only embitters people.At the same time, according to the existing legislation, courts have the right to apply fines and other more humane measures of punishment instead of imprisonment. However, they use this right rarely. I believe that applying punishments that do not involve imprisonment – where this is justified, where there are grounds for this – should become wide legal practice.Our main goal – and we have talked about this a great deal, everyone knows about this – is to achieve inevitability of punishment, not its extreme harshness.One of the factors that ensures the competitiveness of the Russian market is a stable legislative base.Yes, the national legal system is at the stage of formation. And today we have to pass many laws, to more quickly adapt to the changing economic and social conditions. At the same time, even this cannot justify the fact that laws passed often contradict each other. When they are passed, they are not enforced. They are constantly changed, sometimes even before they come into effect.Now the Government has prepared a new set of amendments to the Tax code. And many of the proposed changes deserve support. But I want to point out that even the “best intentions” of the authors should not become an excuse for legal carelessness and underestimating the consequences of decisions passed.Especially as our tax legislation already has examples of norms that have been worked out well. Firstly, let us remember the 13% income tax. By taking this step, we significantly stimulated business activity, replenished the treasury and simplified the tax system. And today I would like to say once more that this rule will not be revised.One of the factors that makes our country uncomfortable, unfortunately, for our citizens, and inhospitable for foreigners, is crime. The law-enforcement bodies should direct their efforts to protecting citizens’ rights, to fighting rackets, administrative abuse and corruption. They should protect the rights of owners and manufacturers.The growth of extremism is a serious threat to stability and public safety in this country. This primarily concerns those who adopt fascist and nationalist slogans and symbols, and carry out pogroms, beating and killing people.At the same time, the police and prosecutor’s office often do not have sufficiently effective tools for charging the organizers and inspirers of these crimes. In many cases only those immediately responsible go to court. In fact, bands of extremists act like organized criminal groups and should be prosecuted in a similar way. A draft law will soon be submitted to the State Duma concerning the war on extremism. Dear State Duma deputies, members of the Federation Council!Last year, the process of establishing the federal districts was completed. Federal power has truly become closer to the regions.I believe that the time has come to bring the implementation of several federal functions to district level, to bring them closer to the territories. Above all, in inspection and personnel work. To be precise, in the spheres of financial control and staffing positions in regional divisions of federal departments, whose number is also subject to reflection..Our key task is work on delineation of powers between federal, regional and local levels of authority. A year ago I spoke from this tribune of the necessity to establish order here. So far, proposals from the power bodies of Federation subjects and local self-administration have been gathered and summarized. A commission created for this purpose will analyse these proposals scrupulously.It is clear that the commission’s task is not easy. But we expect results from its work. They are needed to increase the effectiveness of state policies, stabilize international relations, and bring more clarity to the organization of Russian power bodies as a whole.Now, a few words on the practice of signing agreements on delimitation of authority between the federal centre and Federation subjects. The possibility of signing these agreements is stipulated by the Russian Constitution and is legitimate. At a well-known moment in our history, they were required, and I think they were essential. However, in practice the actual existence of these agreements often leads to virtual inequality in relations between subjects of the Russian Federation. And in the end, this means between citizens who live in different territories of Russia.And in most cases, the delineation of powers only took place “on paper”. It is no coincidence that of the 42 subjects that had concluded these agreements, 28 have already annulled them.Of course, in a country like Russia, regional specifics need to be taken into account. And the need for agreements with individual regions may of course arise. But to sign these agreements “behind the backs” of other Federation subjects, without preliminary discussion, without reaching a public consensus, is in my opinion not right.I think that all agreements on delineation of powers should go through a compulsory procedure of ratification by federal law, by you, dear colleagues. So that everyone knows who has what preferences and why. The Federal Assembly should take this decision. Now on the situation in Chechnya. The military stage of the conflict can be considered to be completed. It has been completed thanks to the courage and heroism of Russian army and special forces. Just a year ago, we counted how many people opposed us there. How many bandits and terrorists: two thousand, three, five or ten thousand. Now it is not important for us how many there are. We need to know where they are. There are still many social and economic problems in the republic, and peaceful life is disrupted by attacks by bandits who remain there. However, an entire people should not have their rights taken away because of this. We cannot allow this. All inhabitants or natives of Chechnya should feel themselves to be full citizens of the Russian Federation.And so the main task of the current stage is to return Chechnya to the political and legal space of Russia. It is to create functioning legal institutions and law-enforcement structures in Chechnya. And in the future, to hold free elections, a free system of republic power and an economically organized life of the Chechen people.Dear Assembly,For a long period of time, federal power has given virtually no attention to problems of local self-administration. As a result, this directly affects the living standard of the population in Russian towns and villages.One of the sources of the situation is the low quality of the legislative base of local self-administration. The Federal law on local self-administration and the according acts of Federation system are only coordinated to a small degree with the real situation in local self-administration, and between themselves.One of the reasons is lack of clarity in the delimitation of authority with regional bodies of power, and also the uncertainty as to what the state bodies should answer for, and what the bodies of local self-administration should answer for.In connection with this, the concept and list of issues of “local significance” need to be specified legislatively. Some of them coincide with tasks carried out by federal and regional bodies of state power. Others require tremendous material support, and can only be successfully realized with the cooperation of subjects, and sometimes with the direct support of the Federation.Furthermore, a major problem for local self-administration remains the inadequacy of its own revenue base. But it is to local bodies that the population turns concerning the implementation of federal laws (such as the law on veterans), the work of housing and communal services, and many other things.I think that federal legislators must determine the structure of local self-administration. Above all, by enforcing by law the forms which have shown their viability in practice. It is also worth remembering our own, pre-revolutionary historical experience.All these issues should be reflected in the new version of the Federal law “On general principles of local self-administration”, and in regional legislation.And finally, it is very important for local self-administration to have the capability to create its own sources for forming the budget. By developing small business, effective use of land, and other property. At the same time, state power – taking into account the expenditure powers of municipalities – could ensure long-term norms of deductions of regulatory taxes.I would like to stress once more: without effective local self-administration, I believe effective organization of power is generally impossible. Furthermore, it is here, at the local level, where enormous resource of public control of power is. And at this level, we must establish order. The order which citizens of the country complain is lacking.Dear colleagues,I would like to discuss the problems of small business separately. I just mentioned this in the context of local self-administration. It is important for the country as a whole. As you know, the Government prepared amendments to legislation on taxation of small business. And in the process of working with them in the State Duma, I would ask you to listen to the opinion of entrepreneurial associations attentively, so as not to repeat the case when after a single social tax was introduced, the tax burden on small business unfortunately only increased. This is not the first case when hidden revision of initial projects takes place “on the way” to the Duma. Revision which leads to a distortion of the original idea.We often say that it is very important for starting businesses to “find their feet”. At the same time, badly thought out or incomplete projects often turn our entrepreneurs upside down rather than putting them on their feet.We must stop pointless rivalry between the people and the authorities – when the authorities create laws, and the people find ways to get around them. People’s creative activity should not be directed towards “optimizing” tax schemes, but developing their own business on the basis of using norms which we provide them with.I would also like to add: changing taxes is important, but only part of the problem. Business in general – and small business in particular – has an enormous amount of complaints about unjustified administrative pressure. And this primarily comes from supervisory bodies and inspections.The problems from this inspection are very extensive, and sometimes completely pointless. They are often a formality. But the material loss from accidents, collapses and fires etc. does not diminish. You pay for a certificate and “burn as much as you want”.Hhundreds of thousands of people oversee this order. Thousands of commercial organisations – this is no exaggeration – are accredited at these bodies to “feed” off inspections. Their dictates and fines, just like extortion and bribes, are an excessive burden and oppress enterprise.We need changes in laws and by-laws which define and regulate the powers of inspection bodies. And where possible, they need to be replaced with more effective measures of responsibility of the economic subjects. We must of course act very carefully in this matter.I believe that we need to expand the practice of comprehensive insurance of responsibility. For order in one sphere or another, an insurance company will “answer with money” – unlike officials who at the worst risk being fined. I am certain: the development of a system of insuring risks will not only lead to an inevitable reduction in the number of inspectors, but also to greater effectiveness of the actual system of control and inspection in the country. It will have a favourable effect on the state of the treasury, on entrepreneurial activity of citizens.Furthermore, the Government should ensure that these inspections are reduced to a minimum – in some regions this practice exists, and functions quite well. We need to declare a moratorium on checks for small enterprises – for example, at least for the first three years of their work. If necessary, changes to legislation need to be made. Several solutions to this problem are already outlined in documents on debureaucratisation that were passed previously.In connection with this, I would also like to appeal to the regional authorities. Your support of small business today is absolutely essential. The decisions of the federal authorities only truly work when there are real actions in the territories of Russia.Dear colleagues,There is another very important topic. One of the serious tasks directly connected with economic growth rates is continuing reform of major Russia companies, the so-called natural monopolies. And here there are enormous reserves for developing competition.Last year, after long discussions, programmes for reforming a series of monopolies were approved. I would like to point out that the state’s “business-like” treatment of these monopolies is unfortunately already being used by them to raise tariffs. And the monopolists’ claims that expenses have increased are not always valid, and are in fact usually invalid.I would like to remind you: reforms to the monopoly sector of the economy should be made in the country’s interests. Consumers of products and services – citizens, municipalities, the state – should not suffer during the modernization process of these giants. Reforms of monopolies are designed to lead to a decrease in expenses, removal of wasteful expenditure, and the appearance of well-thought out investment programmes.To achieve this, it is necessary for the Government to ratify the budgets of infrastructure monopolies as early as this year. So far, no one even knows what goes on there.There is another important question – management of state property. State enterprises still exist in almost all sectors of the economy. But, for example, of the almost 10,000 unitary enterprises, only a handful truly work effectively. And in 2001, around 400 state unitary enterprises were filing for bankruptcy.I should also remind you: we still do not know the real volumes of the state sector. Stock-taking of state property, which has been discussed several times, has not been completed. The ineffective state sector does not give our economy anything but additional expenses and problems. This does not mean that it should not exist – I am only talking about the ineffective sector. I suggest that we should precisely and as quickly as possible deal with property that should be kept in state and municipal ownership.As for bankruptcy, order in this sphere needs to be established– and above all I appeal to you once more – in legislation. Mass bankruptcy of factories has already become a profitable business. We must make the mechanism for carrying out the bankruptcy procedure and factory recovery transparent, market-oriented, and therefore immune to corruption. And I would ask the Federal Assembly not to drag out examination of the corresponding draft laws.An important condition of dynamic economic development is an effective banking system. It is designed to accumulate financial resources and turn them into investment. It is necessary to catch up with the lag in banking reform, to increase banking inspection, to ensure transparency of banks’ activity, and take measures to increase their capitalization.Dear colleagues,One of the most serious issues caused by the lack of competition and monopolization of manufacture and the service sphere is reform of housing and communal services. And this issue, to one degree or another, affects absolutely everyone.On the one hand, the population pays more and more, and on the other hand the quality does not increase. The state spends enormous funds on subsidizing housing and communal services, but the return is still low. In certain regions, the Emergency Ministry has had to solve crises involving communal problems. And the vast majority of those present know this not just by hearsay or from the television.It is clear that the entire system of the housing and communal services requires cardinal changes. And in the initial concept of housing and communal services reforms, money was spent on maintaining technically outdated and extremely worn-out communal systems, on all the leakages and losses in supply, and simply on the expenses of the bad work of housing and communal service enterprises.However, the main goal of reform is to improve the quality of services while reducing supply costs. Only this approach can assuage people’s fears that all housing and communal services reforms will simply involve raising rates.The main thing that remains to be done is to give citizens the rights to control budget subsidies. Otherwise, the population will be forced to become consumers of the services of an irrational and wasteful system.Monopoly in the housing and communal services sphere does not give citizens the chance to choose the required selection of services on the market. I would like to remind the Government and regional leaders that payment can only raised at the same time as developing competition, holding an audit of expenses of commercial enterprises and providing residents with the right to a certain selection and scope of housing and communal services.Only in this case will the consumer be stimulated to economise light and heat, and the producer to use energy-efficient equipment, and install devices for recording consumption of resources. The housing and communal policy is above all to provide accessible accommodation for citizens. But many of our citizens still have bad living conditions. At the same time, there have long been institutions in the world that make it much easier for citizens to solve the problem of buying and keeping a home. Above all, there is the institution of mortgage lending. Of course, this system depends on the general level of development of the country’s economy.The low incomes of the population and high interest rates on financial markets, the undeveloped housing market and enormous prices of construction – this is far from a complete list of the problems which can and should be decided with the help of the mortgage system.In some regions, there has been the first successful experience of housing loans on mortgage. Around 40,000 loans have been provided, and in individual Federation subjects, regional agencies for providing housing loans on mortgage have begun work.I expect that the development of the mortgage system should become a sphere of priority attention for both the federal Government and the regional authorities.Dear colleagues,We need to learn to use the advantages of the new state of the world economy. It is clear that for Russia, the problem of choosing whether to integrate into the world economy or not no longer exists. The world market is already here, and our market has become a part of the world system.At the same time, there are intense discussions in the country about joining the WTO. I can’t avoid discussing this topic either. Sometimes these discussions are so heated that they end with burning effigies of the opponents on the bonfire. I think that we don’t need to go this far, but the issue requires serious examination.The WTO – I want to draw attention to this – is not an absolute evil and not an absolute good. And it is not an award for good behaviour. The WTO is a tool. Those who know how to use it become stronger. Those who cannot or do not want to use it, those who prefer to sit behind protectionist quotas and tariffs are doomed. They are completely doomed strategically.Our country is still “excluded” from the process of forming the rules of world trade. We have not yet been allowed to take part in forming the rules in world trade. This causes the Russian economy to stand still, and its competitiveness to drop.Membership in the WTO should become a tool to protect Russia’s national interests on world market. And it should become a powerful external stimulus to solve the tasks which we need to solve so much.I am certain: the development of the Russian economy is only possible if we are guided by the harsh requirements of the world market, and occupy new niches in it.Thus, the “architecture” of our participation in the WTO should consist of several elements.First, discussions within the WTO are not enough. We need to increase state structures which should help national manufacturers to adapt to new work conditions. We need to revise the existing measures of state support of enterprise. We need to discover programmes that are debatable from the point of view of antidumping investigations, and bring them into line with WTO requirements.And what is fundamentally important, we need to train staff with appropriate qualifications. In each WTO member country, thousands of people work on trade cooperation and disputes. But only a few dozen officials work on this problem in the Russian state mechanism. Where we need specialists, we don’t have enough of them, and where we don’t need them there are plenty of them.We need a constantly functioning discussion platform to bring the interests of Russian business to bodies of state power – the interests of both the supporters and opponents of our participation in the WTO.We still need to seriously analyse federal and regional economic regimes. In the legislation of the regions there are documents which make Russia very vulnerable to the complaints of our competitors.Enormous work rests on our parliament for bringing our legislation and our legal base into line with WTO norms. The new edition of the Customs code, and laws on technical regulation, protection, antidumping and compensation measures, and intellectual property rights are very important. We cannot sit around twiddling our thumbs, we need to get a move on.And of course, the authorities need to continue consultation with industrialists and with trade unions. Everyone should take part in this process. Everyone’s opinion should be taken into account.Dear colleagues,Our economy is not yet receptive enough to the achievements of scientific and technical progress. A significant number of enterprises essentially do not invest any funds in creating new technology or in modernizing old technology.At the same time, there is a huge demand for Russian scientists abroad, for their scientific results and high technology. They are fully competitive, which is shown by the many foreign venture foundations that work in our country. Entire scientific areas and schools are supported by grants from international research centres and international concerns.But we ourselves do not make proper use of the rich scientific and technical potential that Russia possesses. There are very few worthy and long-term projects for this potential in the economy.Thus, the Government should determine forms of state support of new technology. It should find approaches that correspond to our resources, to the modern geography of markets, and types of economic links.It is understandable that the model of scientific and technical progress of former years – a model at once pompous and archaic – should not be reinstated. Decisions are needed that are attached to specific projects, and not individual industries.We need to help Russian developers join the world venture market of capital, ensuring an effective turnover of scientific products and services. And we need to begin this work in the segments of the world market which national manufacturers really can occupy.And finally, we need to create conditions for the healthy commercialization of applied science. This can be done by creating joint enterprises both in Russia and abroad.I make particular mention of public health, as it directly concerns us all. This is mainly the case only when we have problems with our own health.You all know the health figures for the population of Russia – they are not comforting. A great deal has been said about public health services requiring modernization.In the last Address, I set the task of preparing a legislative base for completing the move to an insurance principle for paying medical services and medical aid. We have the habit of putting off the most difficult things, unfortunately. This task has not been fulfilled.One of the undoubted priorities is continuing military reform and moving to a professional army while reducing the term of service by conscription. The reform is requested by society, but above all by the army itself.A new system of recruiting, and reducing terms of service for conscripts, cannot be introduced in one year. Therefore, this year the Defence Ministry is starting an experiment on the basis of individual military formations, which should develop the entire mechanism of moving recruitment of the army and navy to a voluntary principle. According to the results of the experiment, it will be understandable and clear how soon we can move to reduced terms of service by conscription. I stress: significantly reduced terms. This reform cannot be delayed, but there should also not be any fuss in this matter.We will conduct this work gradually – taking into account the financial capabilities of the country, and the national security interests of the state.In moving to a new type of army – an army that is mobile and compact – we must create worthy social conditions for the military and their families. The people who gave years of their life to serve Russia and have left the service should not be ignored by the state. They must be helped to find their place in the economic life of the country.I would also remind you that in October this year, the first state census will be held in the 11 year of the Russian Federation existence.The most general results of this large-scale undertaking will be known at the end of the year. They will give us well-founded statistical information, and clarify the situation on the population size, national make-up, employment, the number of forced migrants and immigrants and so on.It is very important for the country that this census be held thoroughly and competently. It is impossible to make valid administrative decisions without a real understanding of the situation, and information about the make-up of the population. Holding a census is impossible without the effective cooperation and coordination of efforts of the federal and regional authorities, bodies of local self-administration, and the staff of the Presidential plenipotentiaries in the regions.I consider the organization of the census to be a top priority task, and I ask all levels of power to take active participation in preparing for it. And I ask citizens of the country to treat the census with an understanding of the state significance of this undertaking.Dear Assembly,Today, Russia is one of the most reliable guarantors of international stability. It is Russia’s principled position that has made it possible to form a strong anti-terrorist coalition. In the context of allied relations, we have made according decisions along with the leaders of a number of CIS countries.For our country, which has faced terrorism for a long time, there was no choice whether or not to support efforts to destroy the “den” of terrorism. Especially as these measures have indeed helped to increase security on the southern borders of our country, and to a significant degree have helped to improve the situation in this matter in many countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States.By joint efforts, we have been able to solve a very important strategic task – to liquidate the most dangerous centre of international terrorism in Afghanistan. To stop its negative effect on the situation in other countries, and to remove the threat to us that came from there.After 11 September last year, many, many people in the world realized that the “cold war” was over. They realized that now there are different threats, that a different war is on – the war with international terrorism. The danger of this is obvious; it does not require any new proof. I want to make it clear: this also fully applies to Russia. I want to stress that Russian foreign policy will in the future be organized in a strictly pragmatic way, based on our capabilities and national interests: military and strategic, economic and political. And also taking into account the interests of our partners, above all in the CIS.The Commonwealth of Independent States is a real factor of stability in a large part of the world, an influential association of nations with a wide range of tasks and interests.Working with CIS countries is Russia’s main priority in foreign policy. A priority that is also connected to receiving specific advantages on world markets. CIS countries have many opportunities for carrying out large-scale joint projects on infrastructure, transport and energy. I am certain that realizing these projects will increase the durability of our integration, and will provide new possibilities to the Russian economy – and not only the Russian economy.There are large reserves of integration in humanitarian projects, including projects on science and education. Russia has already raised the number of students from CIS countries. And the Government should examine the possibility of further increasing the number of students – at least to 1% of the total number for whom the Russian state currently pays.I believe it necessary to once more clearly state our priorities in Europe. Here our consistent position and numerous steps towards integration with Europe are clear. We will continue active work with the European Union to form a single economic space.Our major goal in foreign policy is to ensure strategic stability in the world. To do this, we are participating in the creation of a new system of security, we maintain constant dialogue with the United States, and work on changing the quality of our relations with NATO.On the whole I would like to note: Russia is being actively integrated into the international community. And despite the harsh competition that I have already discussed, it is particularly important for our country to find allies and itself to be a reliable ally for others.Dear deputies of the State Duma and members of the Federation Council,The principle feature of the modern world is the internationalization of economy and society. And in these conditions, the best world standards become the most important criteria of success. Standards in everything: in business, in science, in sport. In economic growth rates. In the quality of how the state mechanism works, and the professionalism of the decisions we pass.And only when we not only meet the best standards in the world, but when we create these standards ourselves – only then will we really have the chance to become rich and strong.We must make Russia a flourishing and affluent country, so that life here is comfortable and safe. So that people can work freely, and earn money for themselves and their children without restrictions and fear.And so that they strive to come to Russia, and not to leave it. So that they bring up their children here, and build their houses here.Thank you for your attention.",2002
"Moscow, the Kremlin President Vladimir PUTIN:Esteemed State Duma deputies, Esteemed members of the Federation Council,Esteemed citizens of Russia, In presenting the Annual Address for 2001, I would first like to say a few words about the past year. Our strategic task over the last year was to strengthen the state in the form of its institutions and all the levels of power. It was clear that without resolving this key issue we would not achieve success either in the economy or in the social sphere. We set ourselves the objective of building an effectively functioning executive vertical power structure, ensuring legal discipline and creating an effectively functioning judicial system. We must continue to work towards this objective because it is this that will create the mechanism we need for implementing state decisions and for effectively protecting the rights of our citizens. If we are to have a genuinely strong state we need a solid federation. We can now say today that the period of erosion of the state is over. A stop has been put to the disintegration of the state that I spoke of in last year’s address. Last year, we made a great effort together to achieve this. We drafted and adopted a federal legislation package and carried out reform of the Federation Council. The work of the presidential plenipotentiaries in the federal districts is now starting to bring results. The State Council has been created and has begun active work and Russia now finally has state symbols approved by law. All of this took place as the economic situation remained favourable. The Russian economy experienced growth rates unseen in almost 30 years in 2000. Growth continues in some industrial sectors today. Investment activity is on the rise, more taxes are being collected and people are finally being paid their wages and pensions on time for the first time in years. But this is all still not enough and these results cannot leave us satisfied. Our people continue to have very low living standards, Russian businesspeople are still cautious about investing money in their own country, and civil servants, unfortunately, continue putting pressure on business and holding back business initiative and activity. We still have serious economic and social risks to deal with. This can be seen from the Russian towns left without heating and light during the winter, the numerous breakdowns and accidents in the worn out housing and utilities sector infrastructure and the serious technological disasters that have plagued us over this last year. A cause for concern over recent months is the worsening of a number of key economic indicators coinciding with unstable development in the world economy. For now, we are in a situation of only relative economic stability. Whether we can maintain this situation and create favourable conditions for our development and increased prosperity for our people depends on us alone. We have a unique chance and it is up to us to use it or to lose it. If we fail to make use of this opportunity we will still end up having to take the necessary decisions, but no longer in such favourable conditions for our country. The situation requires once more analysing the situation in the country and the objectives that were set earlier, including those announced here in this hall last summer. A year ago it was clear that in order to ensure the success of the strategic transformations we wished to undertake, we would have to bring order to relations between the federal and regional authorities, and that not having clearly delimited powers and effective mechanisms for cooperation between the different levels of power would result in greater economic and social losses. We need a consolidated and effective state power system in order to act on urgent social and economic problems and security issues. I will name just a few of these priorities. The first task is to clearly define the specific powers of the federal centre and the country’s regions. This requires having federal laws, and I emphasise this point, federal laws that divide the powers and responsibilities between the federal and regional authorities. We need to minimise the potential for conflict in this area today by clearly defining the respective powers of the federal and regional authorities, otherwise this situation could give rise to new disputes and will be used by those who oppose this policy of strengthening the federation. The second task is to bring order to the system of regional branches of the federal executive authorities. At the moment they are financially and organisationally weak, duplicate the work of the regional authorities and sometimes are not even up to performing control and supervision functions. The government is to define new procedures for the establishment and work of the regional branches of federal ministries and agencies over the coming months. Finally, the third task, also technical in nature, is to bring order to inter-budgetary relations. Clear distribution of resources and tax revenue is essential for the different levels of power to be able to assume their responsibilities and effectively fulfil their mutual commitments. We carried out a redistribution of tax revenue between the centre and the regions last year. This aroused plenty of debate but it did go some way towards giving regions more equal opportunities and gave them increased possibilities for economic development. New procedures for allocation of budget transfers are already working in practice but still have to be cemented in law, and this will require a review of the current regional support funds’ activities. We are in urgent need of a transparent mechanism for allocation of budget subsidies and transfer payments to the regions. The municipal budgets are a crucial part of the country’s budget system. It is at this level, above all at local government level, that the different state management agencies carry out their functions. It is here that battles take place between regional and local authorities, between mayors and regional governors, usually over budget funds. As a result, budget money at all levels is not always used effectively and for its assigned purpose. This is at the root of much of the economic and political instability in the country’s regions. Finally, the country’s heavily subsidised regions are also in need of particular attention. The government is to complete work on the relevant documents and present draft legislation regarding procedures, if necessary, for putting these regions under special financial management. I would like to say a few words separately about the situation in Chechnya. Today I call above all on all the country’s political forces – all represented here in this hall – to show a sense of responsibility regarding the issue of resolving the problems in this republic. So far, we have managed to avoid speculating on blood and tragedy and using it to earn political dividends and score points. Only recently we were being told that our army is in a state of disintegration and that we should not hope for any shadow of military success. And in the political sphere too, we were told, nothing positive awaited because not a single Chechen would support the federal centre’s attempts to fight terrorists and restore constitutional order. Life itself has shown that these arguments are not founded. Having fulfilled its main missions, the army is withdrawing. This is a serious result and it is has been achieved at a high price. I think therefore, breaking with the tradition of the annual addresses, that it would be a fitting moment to remember our servicemen, the Dagestani home guard, the Chechen policemen and everyone who stopped the collapse of the state at the cost of their lives. The national TV channels are broadcasting this address live to the whole country today. I ask you, not only those here in this hall, but also all those watching us and listening to us today, to stand and honour the memory of our heroes with a minute of silence. I also want to say that, while we are making progress in Chechnya, we should guard against letting euphoria at our successes overtake us. We must not allow unfounded optimism and unrealistic expectations to take hold in society. Yes, our missions in the North Caucasus are changing today. Along with the essential task of liquidating the final hotbeds of terrorism, the emphasis should now shift to creating and strengthening the power system in Chechnya. We must take serious and responsible steps to ensure citizens’ rights, organise social rehabilitation for the people and resolve the economic problems in Chechnya. This demands from us professionalism and courage, both in preventing terrorist attacks and in overcoming the consequences of the crimes we have not managed to prevent. I must say, too, that there is still a great threat that new crimes will be committed. No less courage, determination and patience is required of us in the social and economic sphere. Achieving change will require time, at least as much time as it took to put Chechnya in this extreme situation in which it finds itself now, and we need to be aware of this. Dear colleagues, One of last year’s most important decisions was the creation of the federal districts. The work of the presidential plenipotentiaries has brought federal power closer to the regions. The presidential plenipotentiaries have worked actively to help bring regional legislation into line with federal legislation. They, together with the Prosecutor General’s Office and its branches in the regions, play a key part in this process. More than 3,500 laws passed in the regions contradicted the Russian Constitution and federal laws. Today, four fifths of these laws are now in harmony with federal laws. But we should remember that this kind of rush job, no matter how justified it may be, is not a normal way to work. Ensuring that federal laws are observed, therefore, should be work carried out in a planned fashion and in close contact with the justice authorities, the prosecutors and the courts. I would also like to remind those who pass the laws and those who enforce them that we need to not only ensure that the regions do not infringe on what comes under federal authority, but also that the federal authorities do not make unjustified attempts to intervene in what is exclusively under the regions’ jurisdiction. This is an important point and in this I fully agree with the regional leaders. A key issue for any state authorities is how much the country’s people trust the state. The extent to which people trust the state depends directly on how well the state protects them from the arbitrary actions of racketeers, bandits and bribe takers. But the legislative and executive branches, the courts and the law enforcement agencies all still have shortcomings in their work here and this leads to violations of people’s rights and interests and undermines state authority in general. This, therefore, is a political problem. We are in urgent need today of court reform. The country’s judicial system is lagging behind life and in practice is of little help in carrying out economic transformations. For businesspeople and for many others, the courts are not speedy, just, or fair. This is not always the case, but unfortunately, it is often this way. Arbitration practice also often runs up against a contradictory and unclear legislative base. The setting of rules and regulations by the state ministries and agencies is one of the biggest brakes on developing business. Officials are used to acting according to instructions that, once new laws have come into force, contradict these laws and yet remain unchanged for years. This problem has been noted hundreds of times but practically nothing changes. The government and the ministries and agencies must take radical measures to improve the setting of rules and regulations by ministries and agencies, including abolishing ministry and agency rules and regulations in cases where direct federal laws have already been passed. Today we have a regulation and legislative base – and I will speak later about how this is linked to the work of the civil service – that is superfluous on the one hand and incomplete on the other. We have too many laws, many of which duplicate each other, but in numerous cases these laws do not resolve the issues they are supposed to as they were passed under pressure from narrow group or ministerial interests. What’s more, it has been said many times that all laws should be backed up both organisationally and financially. What we see in practice, however, is a very different picture. The Federal Assembly continues, unfortunately, to pass laws that, to be enforced, would require reviewing the federal budget and the Pension Fund budget, also approved by them. I think that even if motivated by the best intentions, these kinds of decisions are politically irresponsible. We have long been in need of systematised legislation that enables us to take into account new economic realities and also preserve the traditional areas of law that have been dangerously eroded over recent years. The huge number of declarative laws already passed and their contradictory nature creates opportunities for arbitrariness that is unacceptable in an area such as the law. We have practically reached the dangerous point when judges or other law enforcers can choose the particular law they think most suitable. Along with a shadow economy then, this creates a kind of “shadow justice”. Practice shows that when people lose hope of seeing justice done in the courts, they look for other, far from legal, solutions and ways around their problems and sometimes come to the conclusion that taking the illegal road has a greater chance of success than does turning to the courts. This undermines confidence in the state. The situation with procedural legislation is no better, neither for civil nor criminal procedural legislation. There are a huge number of complaints about unjustified violence and arbitrary action when opening criminal cases, carrying out investigations and during court proceedings. Investigations can drag on for years. We have more than a million people sitting in our prisons and pre-trial detention centres. Just think about this figure. A large number of these people are cut off from society, having been sentenced under articles of the Criminal Code that provide for other forms of punishment and not just imprisonment. This is all the more serious as the state is not able to provide these people with normal prison conditions nor to ensure they get the social rehabilitation they need afterwards. The result is families destroyed and a worsening public health situation and moral climate in society. This problem has stopped being just a legal problem and now affects the whole of society. This kind of law enforcement clearly also creates huge opportunities for abuses of citizens’ rights and freedoms and forms a breeding ground for corruption amongst civil servants. The root of this problem lies in ineffective law enforcement instruments and in the structure of our legislation itself. In this respect, we must resolve several tasks in the near future. This includes issues concerning the status of judges and the procedures for their appointment. I think that the qualification colleges should include among their members not just judges but also other authoritative representatives of the legal community. Also, we must ensure that the constitutional principles of equality of the parties and controversy are respected during criminal and civil trials. The legislation on enforcement of court decisions also needs to be considerably improved because at the moment it is far from all court decisions that are actually enforced. It is high time that we brought order to municipal legislation. This legislation is closest of all to people’s daily lives but it is poor quality, overburdened and often illogical. I think that local government practitioners and specialists and public councils in towns and cities that have a wealth of theoretical and practical experience should be involved in this work. We have enough people who could make a contribution here. Finally, it is essential for the state that we improve the work of the law enforcement agencies and the prosecutor’s office. Dear State Duma deputies and members of the Federation Council, In last year’s address I spoke of the danger of a growing lag in the economy. This danger remains with us today. Yes, the results for 2000 show impressive economic growth, a certain increase in labour productivity and reduction in production costs. But high growth rates over just one year are not enough, and what’s more, the growth rate slowed down at the end of last year. Conditions for ensuring a sustainable high growth rate have unfortunately still not been created. The country still has an unfavourable business climate and capital outflow of more than $20 billion a year. Total capitalisation of the Russian stock market comes to around $50 billion, while the biggest companies in our closest neighbour, Finland, have a total value five times higher. Compare the examples – Russia’s biggest companies, its blue chips, are worth several times less than their counterparts abroad. It is clear that if we do not start taking action today, including by carrying out structural reforms, we could end up going into a lengthy period of economic stagnation tomorrow. Our economy is still based primarily on natural resources rather than on manufacturing. Our economic system has changed little in essence. Where does most of our money come from? From oil, gas, metals and other raw materials. The additional revenue we receive from exports is either eaten up, feeds the capital outflow or, at best, gets reinvested in the same raw materials sector. The fuel and energy sector accounted for more than 60 percent of all industrial investment last year. This happened partly because no effective use was found for export revenue in other sectors of the Russian economy. Inflow of capital is hindered by high risks linked to contracts not being fulfilled and an undeveloped financial market infrastructure. Incentives are limited, there is no trust, and as a result, our economy is not modernising, it is staying stuck where it is and is even coming to rely even more on raw materials exports, and thus is even more dependent on cyclical factors. Another tried and tested way of making money well-known in Russia through the centuries, that of making money out of state assets, be they state property or budget funds, remains popular today. In other words, a greater profit is made from distributing and redistributing wealth than is made through creating this wealth. This is what explains the protracted battles over reforming the monopolies. It is no coincidence that we see enthusiasm, both in the government and in the Federation Council, only when budget money is being divided up, and this enthusiasm wanes when it comes to taking the decisions on collecting this budget revenue. A sort of consensus has formed: many are happy with the status quo, this state of inaction, in which some ensure they get financial benefits while others collect the political dividends. Many confuse this status quo with stability, but no one needs this kind of stability, for it is nothing more than maintaining a flawed tradition based on frittering away national resources and it is a road to economic and social stagnation. We can avoid this situation if we ensure that attempts to carry out structural reforms go beyond merely drawing up concepts and programmes, and the government must finally prove that this practice will no longer exist. I am convinced that the cause of this state of affairs lies not only in resistance to reforms from the civil servants, though examples of this abound. I think the cause lies also in the way the legislative and executive authorities themselves work. This system of work is currently organised in such a way that it hampers and often simply halts reforms. The system looks after its own rights to receive a sort of payment for status, in other words, bribes and compensation. This form of existence of the state authorities constitutes a threat for society and for the state itself. We must begin preparing administrative reform, above all of the government, the ministries and agencies and their branches in the regions, and we need to review not so much their structure and staff as the functions for which they are responsible. Previous repeated attempts to streamline the management apparatus and merge or separate agencies have made the government and its agencies neither more compact nor more effective. It is enough to say that the number of people working in the state agencies and apparatuses has risen from 882,000 in 1993 to more than a million today. This year, the government has prepared a package of legislation on de-bureaucratisation and minimisation of state intervention in business. We need to work on further reducing the number of activities requiring licenses, because even though it has already been shortened, this list is still far too long. We must make energetic efforts to bring order also to other sectors that suffer from excessive state intervention. I emphasise that we are talking here of excessive intervention. I have in mind above all at the moment compulsory certification of goods and various permits, registrations, accreditations and other norms and rules not provided for by legislation but introduced with determination by all kinds of instructions. We should have no illusions: only transparent relations between business and the state, relations that are fixed in direct legislation, will give the Russian economy the development impulse it needs. Dear colleagues, Last year we began reform of the budget. We passed a deficit-free budget, but the procedure by which the budget went through, or rather, was pushed through the State Duma, was more reminiscent of a round of haggling between the government and the deputies. This kind of haggling is inevitable with budget approval procedures as they are today. I call on you to examine together ways for moving away from this now familiar practice. I think it is time we looked at forming a budget that would consist of two parts. The first part should ensure that all the state’s commitments are fulfilled. The parliament should have the right to either accept or reject the government’s proposals concerning this part, but not to change its parameters. The second part of the budget should be based on revenue sources linked to the favourable foreign economic situation. It can build up a reserve that can be used to ensure stable development during less favourable years and also for financing large-scale strategic objectives. There can and should be discussion and debate on amendments concerning this part. I think that this kind of budget based on two parts will enable us to avoid eating up these additional revenues. Going further. One of the points in my election campaign programme was far-reaching tax reform. We have taken the first steps in this direction and now need to move further. Running a little ahead here, I would like to remind you of my attitude concerning the results of privatisation. I am against a new carve-up of assets. Although I do not doubt the aims and objectives that were behind these transformations in the 1990s, I think that we should listen to the questions raised regarding the way they were carried out. These questions are coming not only from supporters of a planned economy but also from liberals. Carving up assets again, however, could prove even more harmful and dangerous for the economy and social sphere, so, going on the situation we have today, what we need to do now is ensure these resources are used effectively and contribute as they should to state revenue, and the only way to do this is through tax instruments. Our strategic priority today is to ensure fair and rational taxation of natural resources (Russia’s main source of wealth) and real estate, and also to lower taxes on non-rent income and completely phase out turnover taxes. The government will very soon complete its examination of these problems and, as the Prime Minister has just informed me, the relevant draft laws will be introduced to the parliament within three, maximum four weeks. We must also continue customs reform. Measures have already been taken to simplify and reduce import duties but this is still not enough. We need to make radical change to the system of customs administration. The main task in this area this year is to adopt the new draft Customs Code as a direct law. Of course, this code should be in line with the standards set by the World Trade Organisation. Joining the WTO remains a priority for Russia. We need to reach basic agreements with the WTO member states by the end of this year. The parliament’s task is to bring Russian legislation into line with the World Trade Organisation’s norms and provisions. Russia’s integration into the world economy requires us to take a civilised approach to settling the debt problem. We have to learn lessons for the future from today’s situation and only borrow when we know exactly how to spend the money effectively and how to pay it back without creating a debt burden for our children and grandchildren. The government, therefore, must be very careful in making any decisions on new borrowing. In this respect, I want to say a few words about the government’s decision not to sign an agreement with the International Monetary Fund. The government has reached a general agreement on budget, monetary and structural policy, but has taken on the responsibility of carrying out this programme without signing a formal agreement with the IMF. I think the government is able to control its own actions and should prove that it is able to do this without supervision from the international financial organisations, but within the framework of the programme that was prepared. Now coming to the business climate in the country. Unfortunately, ownership rights are still not well protected. The level of corporate governance is still low. Battles over ownership rights continue even after court decisions have been taken, and these decisions themselves are often not based on laws so much as on pressure from the parties involved. We must protect the rights of honest buyers of real estate and securities or any other property. Of course, this includes not just the property of large corporations – we have to protect the property rights of all, big and small property owners, Russian and foreign investors. I think the government and the Federal Assembly should draft the relevant legislation in this area this year. Moreover, we need to speed up the adoption of a new law on privatisation, a law that will set clear and transparent rules for the sale and acquisition of state assets and that will put an end to the political speculation on the subject of “selling Russia”. Unfortunately, this kind of talk continues today with occasional calls to take back assets, confiscate property and so on. We already lived through a time when the state owned everything, and we all know well how this ended. I am convinced that the state’s effectiveness is not measured by how many assets it owns but rather by how effective are the political, legal and administrative mechanisms it uses to uphold public interests in the country. It was precisely this that I was talking about when I spoke about tax reform. This same principle applies to the military-industrial complex, a sector of major importance for our country. Private entrepreneurs already supply half of our defence requirements, including through joint-stock companies with state participation. I think we should expand the private sector’s involvement in defence research and production. This should be done, of course, only in clear respect of the set requirements and through a public procurement system. Now a few words about the land question. This is an issue that has dragged on a very long time. A solution could be to abandon attempts to cover all aspects of state regulation of land relations in the Land Code. The main thing today is not to hinder development of a land market in areas where it is already established and to make the Land Code reflect the most modern ideas about ways and methods of regulating land relations and recognise that non-agricultural land should now be able to be bought and sold without restriction. Regulating the purchase and sale of agricultural land will obviously require passing a special federal law and it should be perhaps up to the regions to decide for themselves the timetable for introducing a market for agricultural land. An accessible and developed transport and energy infrastructure that is transparent in its functioning is extremely important for the country. We have already begun reforms in the electricity sector, gas supplies, railways and communications. It is clear for everyone that we can no longer tolerate the lack of financial transparency in these sectors, rising costs and ineffective management. The practice of large-scale cross subsidies also cannot continue. But as we begin real transformations in these infrastructure monopolies, we must take great care to calculate the economic and social consequences and also to respect owners’ and investors’ rights. This is of great importance because it is precisely these monopolies that form the foundation of our economy, today at least. Another question of importance is capital export. I am sure that if we create an acceptable business climate in the country, capital will stop fleeing abroad. You can’t keep capital under lock and key – it has to have the legal freedom to go wherever it sees the biggest advantage and greatest effectiveness. Strategically, capital can only be kept in place by giving it the right conditions and ensuring free enterprise, within the framework of the law, of course. So I don’t think it makes sense to cling to currency restrictions that do not work anyway, and I already gave you the figures. It is time to review the very principles of currency regulation and bring them closer into line with world practice. I think that the current restrictions on capital and real estate operations discriminate against Russian citizens compared with the citizens of other countries, restrict their freedom and undermine the competitiveness of Russian business. We should keep strictly to the principle of most-favoured treatment of our own citizens in all our actions. Russian citizens should not be banned from doing what foreign citizens have the right to do here. Esteemed Assembly,Our country’s development is not measured only by economic successes but also, and not in the least, by its level of spiritual and physical health, although, of course, all of these things are interlinked. The nation’s health today is directly linked not only to the state of the public health system but also to people’s way of life, to the environment and the development of medical science. In the modern world, health protection is a state-level issue. The government approves every year a programme of state-guaranteed free medical treatment, but this programme is not backed up the necessary state funds in the absolute majority of the country’s regions. The deficit of funds for this programme comes to 30–40 percent of the requirements and this gap is filled, and let us be direct and honest about this, by patients themselves, who end up having to pay for their medicines and treatment. Restructuring in the medical system is going ahead slowly. The increase in paid services is leading to a hidden commercialisation of state and municipal hospitals and treatment centres. Meanwhile, the medical insurance system, which is supposed to compensate patients for their healthcare costs, is working ineffectively. What we now have, essentially, is a hidden but almost legalised system of paying healthcare based on the network of budget-funded medical centres, and within this system we often see arbitrariness and no real social justice at all. Our objective this year is to create the legislative base for a transition to a healthcare system based on medical insurance. This must be done within the framework of the common medical-social insurance system and the funds for its implementation must be guaranteed. We must use this as a foundation for overcoming the chronic shortage of financial resources and ensure that the population has access to a full range of state-guaranteed basic healthcare services. We must make these services genuinely accessible and increase the quality of free healthcare for the population, and regarding paying healthcare, we must develop a clear legal and economic base for its work. Just as important a priority for the state is to ensure that our people have a decent old age. Population decline is continuing in our country, the share of old people will increase over time and so will the burden on the working-age population. We know the forecasts in this area. But unfortunately, the state does not have great possibilities for ensuring that current and future pensioners get a decent old age. The funds available today are enough only for paying minimal pensions. Yes, we did manage to improve a little the lives of elderly people last year. Pensions were paid on time and increased by around 28 percent in real terms. This was the biggest increase over the last few years. This year we must take another step forward and bring the average pension up to the subsistence level. These are still just modest goals. We cannot guarantee decent lives for our pensioners under the current system, and so we need to move quickly to introduce a new, more effective pension system. People are ready for this change. Surveys show that more than 60 percent of Russians think we need to radically change the way the country’s pension system works. We have set up a National Council for Pension Reform to discuss the basic mechanisms for moving over to a new system. This council should become an effective policy-forming instrument in this sector that is of such importance for society, and it will be the body that works out the new principles for pension legislation. No one working today knows exactly what kind of pension they will receive. No one knows because pensions are not calculated on the basis of what each individual has contributed, but depend upon future generations of workers, and we cannot predict how effectively they will work and contribute to the pension system. We need to move over to a comprehensible individual pension savings system. People should be sure that each rouble they earn will have an impact on the size of the pension they receive later. This will serve as an additional incentive and will help bring wages into the open. Successful pension reform is directly linked to labour relations. Many people today have only limited opportunities to legally earn their wages and are forced to resort to all sorts of cunning schemes, bypassing labour and administrative legislation that just does not work in practice. The archaic Labour Code adopted in 1971 is still in force today. The gap is growing all the time between modern market-based civil legislation and the old labour legislation, and this is preventing labour relations to be above board, and is also keeping trade unions from having any say. The deputies, the government and the trade unions have very different views on the Labour Code. What we need are labour laws that protect workers’ rights and interests not on paper but in practice. We need laws that ensure labour resource mobility and that open the way for structural changes in companies. I very much hope that the parliament will speed up work on and approval of the Labour Code based on the government proposal. In the social services provision sector what we especially need are effectiveness, transparency and clarity. Each citizen should know clearly what they are entitled to receive free from the federal authorities and what they should pay for themselves. The authorities at every level of power should have their responsibilities clearly set out. In accordance with this principle, we should move away from public sector financing based on estimated financing requirements to a system of financing based on set public procurement, and just as importantly, we should create the conditions for competition at all levels – between state and private organisations for the opportunity to provide social services. Education is one sector where we should expand opportunities for economic mechanisms to work. More than a quarter of our country’s population is involved in education at any one time. On the one hand this is a lot, but on the other hand it is not enough at all. The rate at which the modern economy, science and information technologies are developing mean that education should become an ongoing part of life. I think we should change our very approach to education. In the era of globalisation and new technologies, education is more than just part of the social sphere, it represents an investment in the country’s future and should involve companies, public organisations and citizens, everyone without exception who has an interest in quality education for our children. Education cannot depend solely on budget distribution of resources. Extra-budgetary funding of educational institutions, fees, in other words, to call it what it really is, have in many cases become the norm. but this market is not transparent and it is not legal. School directors adopt it at their own risk. An education system that remains officially free while being fee-paying in practice corrupts both pupils and teachers. We must clearly set out the limits for free education, ensure fair and guaranteed access to this education and also create an adequate legal foundation for fee-paying education. Our task this year is to develop state education standards that should become the foundation for later introducing norms for per-capita financing of education services. At the same time, we should create an independent attestation and education quality control system in the interests of improving the quality of education. No less important is the task of improving access to education for people from low-income families through targeted allowances. We often hear that science in our country is in a miserable state. I would like to say a few words about this. We hear that the main reason for this bad state of affairs is the meagre funding the state provides. This is partly true, but only partly. Contrary to widespread belief, Russian science is not only very much alive but is developing, though not as fast as we would like. Extra-budgetary financing sources have come to play a big part in financing science, increasing as a share of total financing from 5 percent to 50 percent over the last decade. Russian science has begun to work for the market and to develop intensive cooperation with Russian and foreign business. Many developments by Russian scientists are fully competitive on world markets. The state, of course, can and should support fundamental science. But the state should act as a client for research and development only within the limits of its economic possibilities. Today then, we need to clearly define state priorities for financing scientific work and also change financing mechanisms, including by borrowing the experience of Russian scientific funds that have been financing particular research, and not entire research institutions, on a tender basis for quite a while now. We should also remedy the incomplete and extremely contradictory nature of the legislative base for science. Legislation for managing this sector is very unwieldy, complex and confused. The Russian Academy of Sciences’ charter and legal basis for its work are archaic. The system of intellectual property protection and use is inadequate. These problems must all be resolved. Dear colleagues,In working towards our economic and social objectives we must take into account not only the domestic political situation but also the strength of our international positions. Foreign policy is an indicator and a major component of domestic affairs. We should have no illusions here. Not only our authority on the international stage but also the political and economic situation in Russia itself depend on how competently and effectively we use our diplomatic possibilities. I have said before that Russia should build its foreign policy on the basis of clearly defined national priorities, pragmatism and economic effectiveness. Our country is becoming more and more integrated into the world economy today and this is why we must act in the foreign policy sphere to protect our country’s economic interests and the interests of Russian business and Russian citizens. It is our duty to ensure and to serve, if you will, the interests of the Russian economy, and this means that we must fight discrimination against our producers, preserve and ensure optimum use of Russian assets abroad, speed up the work on Russia’s accession to the WTO on conditions that are acceptable to us and generally work to make Russia competitive in all senses of the word. Having a good reputation is important not only in the economy but also in politics, and this is why we must fulfil all our long-term commitments and agreements and uphold the principles upon which our ties with other countries are based – a balance of interests, mutually beneficial cooperation and respect and trust. This approach is far more productive than rigid ideological dogma. Those who share this approach can always be sure that they will find an interested and predictable partner in Russia. But it is a matter of principle for us that our international partners also respect and consider our national interests. This applies completely also to discussion of questions regarding strategic stability, disarmament, NATO expansion and forming the foundations of the world order in the twenty-first century. Our efforts to activate work within the CIS are dictated not only by our historic closeness but also by obvious practical considerations. Russia is the nucleus of integration processes in the CIS, and as Russia’s economy experiences an upturn, this opens up new opportunities. We will continue the hard work on building a union state with Belarus and we will continue to encourage further integration in the CIS as a whole. The signature of the treaty setting up the Eurasian Economic Community is just a first significant step and we are ready to go further in this direction. We must breathe new life into our relations with European and other international structures, while at the same time maintaining and developing all that is positive that has built up over the previous years. Dynamic processes are now at work in Europe and the role of large European organisations and regional forums is changing. In this respect, our efforts to build up a partnership with the European Union will become even more important. Integration with Europe is one of the key areas of our foreign policy. We are consistent also in our relations with NATO. These relations are regulated by the Founding Act on mutual relations, cooperation and security that was signed in 1997. We think that this organisation often ignores the opinion of the international community and the provisions of international legal documents in its decision-making process, and this is the biggest problem. The future of our relations with NATO therefore depends on how closely the basic principles and norms of international law will be respected in questions of use of force and threat of the use of force. Our position is clear: the only organisation with the right to authorise the use of force in international relations is the United Nations Security Council. Another problem that it is my duty to mention here at this tribune is the defence of the rights and interests of Russians abroad, our compatriots in other countries. The hundreds of thousands of Russians living and working outside this country must be sure that Russia will not abandon them should they find themselves in a difficult situation, that we will protect their personal rights, protect their families from possible violations of the law and from unlawful pressure and help uphold their human dignity. No one should be allowed to apply a selective version of human rights and freedoms based on people’s passports, and our diplomats should be not only active in such cases, but should show professional firmness and take effective action. I wish to emphasise particularly that all the state authorities should view foreign policy today as a very sensitive and important affair. We should keep in mind that the prosperity of our country and our citizens, the situation of our compatriots abroad and, last but not least, our success in domestic affairs, depends on how intelligently, sensitively and effectively we pursue our foreign policy. Esteemed members of the Federation Council and State Duma deputies, The last decade has been a stormy, even revolutionary time for Russia. Last year and the beginning of this year seem rather calm compared to the past years. For many people, now used to constant crises, the lack of political upheavals have given rise to predictions of structural and personnel changes. I want to be quite clear in saying that we do not and should not fear change. But any change, whether political or administrative, should be justified by the circumstances. Of course, public expectations and fears do not arise out of nowhere. They are based on the well-known logic that after revolution comes counter-revolution, and this is followed by a search for those guilty of revolutionary excesses and their punishment, all the more so as Russian history abounds in such examples. But it is time to say firmly that this period is over and there will be neither revolution nor counter-revolution. State stability built on a solid economic foundation is a blessing for Russia and for its people. It is high time now to start living according to normal human logic and realise that we have long and hard work ahead of us. Our main problems are too far-reaching and require not a policy of jumps forward here and there but qualified, daily work. Stability, however, is not bureaucratic stagnation. We need bold and carefully prepared decisions, competent and well-qualified specialists, both in the business community and in the civil service. In conclusion, I would like to say once more that after a stormy decade of reform we are now entering a period where our long-term success depends on our will, our qualifications and our determination. We have exhausted the potential of transition period measures, but in order to ensure that today’s political stability becomes tomorrow’s economic prosperity, we must put in a lot more effort and this will take more than one year. The authorities must ensure that there can be no backing away from democratic freedoms and that the economic course we have chosen cannot be reversed. The authorities must work in order to guarantee this policy of improving the lives of all groups of our population and take a consistent and law-based approach to improving the country’s business climate. In addressing today the Federal Assembly, the government and the regional and local authorities, I ask you to remember that we will not achieve tangible results of we do not remove people’s fears and cautious attitude towards the state. The cause of many of our problems lies in this ingrained lack of trust in a state that has deceived citizens on many occasions in the past, and in this inherited suspicion people feel towards the state given the lack of authentic civil equality and business partnership. I deliberately kept your attention on problems today, on shortcomings, because I think that an objective analysis of our own shortcomings is a lot more useful than soothing speeches, though I could have chosen to develop this theme. Last year showed clearly that we can work together and that we now need to learn to work together effectively. I ask all who work for the state to treat this as their main and most important mission, I repeat, their most important mission. Thank you for your attention. ",2001
"Moscow, the KremlinPresident Vladimir Putin:Dear Yegor Semyonovich,Dear Gennady Nikolaevich,Dear State Duma deputies and members of the Federation Council,Dear citizens of Russia,In accordance with the Constitution, I present you with the Address to the Federal Assembly of Russia. It will concern priorities in state work. A great deal has already been started and is being done collectively. But there are also long-term tasks which will require intensive efforts.We agreed with the leadership of both chambers to meet after my speech and discuss the main parameters of the Address which I am making to you. I very much hope that this discussion will help effective organization of future work.This time, the Address is being made in the middle of the year, rather than at the beginning. And, as you know, this is because of objective circumstances – primarily the Russian Presidential elections. Only the current head of state has the right to present programme tasks to bodies of power, and only he has the real ability to organize their effective implementation.The last half year showed that there is already quite a high level of agreement in society on fundamental issues of the country’s development. Constructive, if difficult, work has begun for legislative and executive power. The newly formed federal government is showing that it is capable of systematic and planned work. Programme documents on the socio-economic development of the country have in general been approved. The state approach to the matter is in many ways clear.I am grateful to both the Federal Assembly and the Government for the fact that without losing any time, we have begun to prepare and implement important decisions for the country. I want to thank all citizens, everyone who supported us in these undertakings. And in the future, I count on the active participation of everyone in affairs of the Russian state.A major event of recent months was the examination of laws that improve federal relations and change the state of affairs in the social and tax spheres. Their introduction will become a reference point of a new era in building the state, and in the rules of behaviour in the economy.A period is beginning in Russia when the authorities have the moral right to demand that norms established by the state are observed. Perhaps the most serious problem in recent years was the unreasonable level of taxation, or one of the most serious problems. This was discussed a great deal, but nothing was done. The discussion went in a vicious circle, and few believed that the situation could change. Today the first steps have been made. New legislative parameters are established – and thus new rules are established. But work in this area, and we just discussed it with the Prime Minister, is still proceeding with great difficulty.Introducing a single rate for income tax, reducing deductions to social off-budget funds will help to bring income out of the shadows. The weakening of the tax burden will make it possible for conscientious entrepreneurs to develop their business confidently in their own country.It must be admitted: the dictates of the shadow economy and “grey” schemes, the wave of corruption and mass flow of capital abroad has in many ways been helped by the state itself. It has been helped by the vagueness of rules and by unjustified restrictions.For a long time we have been trying to make the choice: to rely on others’ advice, aid and loans, or to develop relying on our own distinctive character, and own efforts. Many countries have also faced this choice.If Russia remains weak, we really will have to make the former choice. And it will be the choice of a weak state. It will be the choice of the weak. The only real choice for Russia is the choice of a strong country. A country that is strong and confident of itself. Strong not in defiance of the international community, not against other strong nations, but together with them.Now that we are moving forward, it is more important not to remember the past, but to look to the future. We must insure that all of us – entrepreneurs, power structures, all citizens – strongly feel their responsibility to the country. So that strict fulfilment of the law becomes the deliberate choice of all citizens of Russia.Policies built on the basis of open and honest relations of the state with society will protect us from repeating past mistakes, and are the basic conditions of a new “social contract”.Dear colleagues,Before I speak of priorities and set tasks, I will mention the most serious problems that the country faces.We have become accustomed to regard Russia as a system of bodies of power, or as an economic organism. But Russia is above all the people who consider this country to be their home. Their prosperity and good standard of living is the government’s main task. It is the task of any government! However, our home is a long way from comfort. It is still hard for many people to raise children, and to ensure a worthy old age for their parents. It is difficult to live.We, the citizens of Russia, are becoming fewer and fewer with each passing year. For several years now, the population has dropped by an average of 750,000 people every year. And if we are to believe the predictions, and these predictions are based on real work, the real work of people who understand this and have devoted their entire lives to this, in 15 years, the number of Russian citizens may drop by 22 million.I would ask you to think this figure over: it is one seventh of the country’s population. If the current tendency continues, the survival of the nation will be threatened. We really do face the threat of becoming an enfeebled nation. Today the demographic situation is one of the most alarming that the country faces.The economic weakness of Russia continues to be another serious problem. The growing gap between leading nations and Russia pushes us towards becoming a third world country. The figures of current economic growth should not be any cause for comfort: we continue to live in conditions of progressing economic lag. I would ask you to pay special attention to this.At first glance, the country’s economy does not look bad at the moment. GDP, industrial production, investment and tax collection are growing. However, economic growth, as in the recovery period of 1997, is at risk. Two year ago the apparent prosperity, which was based on large-scale state borrowing, collapsed under a massive financial crisis.The current economic figures only look optimistic when compared with earlier ones. I want to stress this, only when compared with earlier ones! But they are very modest in comparison with other countries, which are developing, and much more quickly and more stable than we are. The current growth is only to a small extent connected to the renewal of the economic mechanism. In many ways, it is the result of a favourable external economic situation.To digress from the text, I would like once more to return to what I said at the beginning: tax reform. I would ask the State Duma deputies to carefully look at what the Government offers in the context of what I just said earlier.We cannot be happy with this situation. And this is not just because of our national pride, although this is also important. The issue is far more serious and dramatic. Can we hold out as a nation, as a civilization, if our prosperity continually depends on international loans and on the benevolence of leaders of the world economy?Russia needs an economic system which is competitive, effective and socially just, which ensures stable political development. A stable economy is the main guarantor of a democratic society, and the very foundation of a strong nation that is respected in the world.Russia also faces serious external problems. Our country is involved in all international processes, including economic globalization. We do not have the right to “sleep through” the information revolution that is underway in the world.We cannot and must not lose out strategically. This is why the Conception of foreign policy was recently ratified, an updated Conception of foreign policy. It acknowledges the supremacy of domestic goals over foreign ones. The independence of our foreign policy is in no doubt. The foundation of this policy is pragmatism, economic effectiveness, and the priority of national tasks. But we still need to work on making these principles the norm of state life.The cold war is a thing of the past, but to this day there is a need to overcome its difficult consequences. These are attempts to infringe on the sovereign rights of nations in the guise of “humanitarian” operations, or as they say nowadays, “humanitarian” intervention, and difficulties in finding a common language in issues which represent a regional or international threat.Thus, in the conditions of a new type of external aggression – international terrorism and the direct attempt to bring this threat into the country – Russia has met with a systematic challenge to its state sovereignty and territorial integrity, and found itself face to face with forces that strive towards a geopolitical reorganization of the world.Our efforts to save Russia from this danger are often interpreted in a subjective and biased manner, and serve as the occasion for various types of speculation. An important area of foreign policy activity should be ensuring objective perception of Russia. Reliable information on the events in our country is a question of its reputation and national security.A response to this and many other challenges are impossible without strengthening the state. Without this, it is impossible to solve another national task. And although strengthening the state has for some years been proclaimed as the goal of Russian policy, we have not moved beyond declarations and empty talk. Not at all!Our most important task is to learn to use these tools of state to ensure freedom – freedom of personality, freedom of enterprise, freedom of developing institutions of civil society. The debate about the ratio between force and freedom is as old as the world itself. It continues to cause speculation on the themes of dictatorship and authoritarianism.But our position is very clear: only a strong, or effective if someone dislikes the word ‘strong’, an effective state and a democratic state is capable of protecting civil, political and economic freedoms, capable of creating conditions for people to lead happy lives and for our country to flourish.Dear deputies, members of the Federation Council,The root of many of our misfortunes is in the lack of development of civil society and in the authorities’ inability to talk and work with it. The authorities constantly go to extremes – they either ignore society, or become excessively protective of it. At the same time, the idea exists that everything in Russia depends on the regime. The regime really does answer for everything. But a great deal also depends on Russian citizens themselves. The development of the country is in many ways determined by the level of their responsibility, the maturity of political parties, social organizations, and the civic position of the media.Over the past decade, fundamental changes have taken place in the country – rights and freedoms of the individual are guaranteed by the Constitution, a democratic political system has formed, and a multi-party system has become reality. Russian citizens vote for the President, State Duma deputies, governors, mayors, and bodies of self-administration.However, the letter of the law and real life are often quite different things. Only the framework of a civil society has been formed in Russia. Collective, patient work is now required for it to become a full partner of the state. We are not always able to combine patriotic responsibility for the destiny of our country with what Stolypin once called “civil liberties”. So it is still hard to find a way out of a false conflict between the values of personal freedom and the interests of the state.At the same time, a strong state is unthinkable without respect for people’s rights and freedom. Only a democratic state can ensure a balance of interests of personality and society, and combine private initiative with national tasks.In a democratic society, a constant link between the people and government is provided by political parties. Thanks to elections, this important tool has today received the greatest possibilities for development. Without parties, it is impossible to carry out the policies of the majority, or protect the position of the minority.Against the background of centuries-old traditions of parliamentarianism and multi-party systems in other countries, the shortcomings of our party system are particularly noticeable. A weak government benefits from having weak parties. It is easier and more comfortable for it to live by the rules of political bargaining. But a strong government is interested in strong rivals. Only in conditions of political competition is serious dialogue possible on the development of our state.Russia needs parties which have mass support and stable authority. And they do not need parties of officials which are attached to the government, let alone which replace it. Experience has shown, and we have known this for the past several years, that formations like this perish immediately, as soon as they leave their incubator for a competitive environment.Today, the time has come to prepare a law on parties and party activity, and in fact I believe this topic is already under discussion at the Duma. It seems to me that we need to work on this more actively. Perhaps only social and political associations should put forward candidates for President. I understand that this is a serious issue, and it needs separate wide discussion.The current state of the trade union movement is another matter. Tendencies of formalism and bureaucratization have also affected these groups of citizens. In new conditions, trade unions should not take on state functions in the social sphere. This should not be done. Citizens of Russia do not need more intermediaries in distributing social welfare, they need professional control of fair labour contracts and observing their conditions.This means that the tasks of trade unions is to protect the rights of hired employees in the state and private sectors, study the structure of the market, organise legal study and search for priorities in the sphere of training personnel. The field of work here is enormous, and the state alone cannot deal with it. And the state should not work alone here. This is where it should work together with trade unions. In the establishment of civil society, the media plays an exclusive role. We talk about this problem a great deal. By standing up for the right to freedom, Russian journalists have often risked their own career – they have even risked their lives! Many of them have perished.Nevertheless, a free press has been established in Russia. However, the Russian media, like society as a whole, is still in the process of being established. This needs to be said directly. This is where all the problems and the “growing pains” of the country are reflected, as in a mirror. Because they are working here, in the country, and not observing the events from an island somewhere. The way society is, the way the government is – this is the way journalism is here. So when people tell me: “Deal with the media, do this and that,” I reply: let us deal with society as a whole, and then the media will change. But without a truly free media, Russian democracy cannot survive, and a civil society cannot be created.Unfortunately, we have not yet been able to develop clear democratic rules that guarantee true independence of the “fourth column”. I want to stress this – true independence. Journalistic freedom has become a coveted item for politicians and major financial groups, and a convenient tool for war between clans.As the President of the country, I consider it my duty to point this out to society.Censorship and inference with media activity is prohibited by law. The government strictly keeps to this principle. But censorship can come elsewhere than from the state, and inference is not just always administrative. The economic ineffectiveness of a significant part of the media makes it dependent on the commercial and political interests of its owners and sponsors. It makes it possible to use the media as a way to score points off rivals, and sometimes even to turn it into a means of mass disinformation, a means of fighting the state.Therefore, we are obliged to guarantee journalists real, not illusory, freedom, and create legal and economic conditions in the country for civilized information business.Freedom of speech was and remains a firm value of Russian democracy. This is our fundamental position.I would also like to discuss another important topic.I am certain that the development of society is unthinkable without agreement on common goals. And these goals are not just material ones. Spiritual and moral goals are no less important.The unity of Russia is strengthened by the patriotism inherent in our people, by cultural traditions and common historic memory. And today in Russian art, in theatre and the cinema, there is a growth of interest in Russian history, in our roots and what is dear to us all. This, without doubt – I, at any rate, am certain of this – is the beginning of new spiritual development.The democratic organization of the country and the new Russia’s openness to the world, do not contradict our uniqueness or patriotism, and do not hinder us from finding our own answers to issues of spirituality and morals. And we do not need to look for a national idea specially. It is already ripening in our society. The most important thing is to understand the kind of Russia that we believe in and the kind of Russia we want to see.With all the abundance of views, opinions and the diversity of party platforms, we have had and continue to have common values. Values which join us and allow us to call ourselves a single people.Dear colleagues,Moving to priorities in economic policy, we must first of all examine what has caused the current economic growth, and whether it is stable, and how vulnerable to external influences. I talked about this at the very beginning, and now I would like to go into more detail.On the one hand, current figures are partially the result of the favourable foreign trade situation. Everyone in this hall understands what I am talking about. On the other hand, the behaviour of enterprises and market subjects is beginning to change, and they are increasingly guided by effective demand, and reduce the costs of production. This also cannot be ignored, it is a fact. At the same time, there is the danger that these tendencies cannot be consolidated here. The deeper reasons for the instability of our economic development remain the same, and the basic principles by which the economy works change slowly here. These problems lie in excessive intervention by the state in spheres where it should not be present, and in its absence where it is necessary. Today, the state’s involvement is unnecessary in property, enterprise and consumption to a certain extent. But on the other hand, the state remains passive in creating a common economic space for the country, in compulsory implementation of the law, and protecting property rights.The main obstacles to economic growth are high taxes, corruption among officials and extensive crime. Solving these problems depends on the state. However, an expensive and wasteful state cannot lower taxes. A state prone to corruption, with unclear limits of jurisdiction, will not save entrepreneurs from corrupt officials and the influence of crime. An ineffective state is the main reason for the long and deep economic crisis – I am absolutely sure of this – and we know well the manifestations of this crisis.Very many national enterprises remain uncompetitive. They have survived mainly thanks to the devaluation of the rouble, reduced tariffs on energy resources, non-payment and barter. The raw-material orientation of the market remains. Budget revenues depend to a large extent on the dynamic of world prices on energy resources. We are losing out in competition on the international market, which focuses more and more on innovation sectors, on a new economy of knowledge and technology. A significant part of the Russian economy remains in the shadows. One of the signs of the state’s weakness, its inconsistency in carrying out necessary changes, is the excessive accumulation of state debt, particularly foreign debt. Despite being reconstructed several times, the burden of state debt represents a threat to the country’s development. Accumulated debts force us to spend not less than a third of budget revenues on servicing them and paying them off. The problem is that the debt is not getting any smaller. Reconstruction is such that the debt does not get smaller, it only grows.We have become hostage to an economic model based on populist policies. We tried to treat diseases by covering them up. We constantly delayed passing systematic and fundamental decisions designed to have long-term consequences.It is necessary to learn lessons from our experience and admit that the state’s key role in the economy is undoubtedly the protection of economic freedom. Our strategic line is as follows: less administration, and more entrepreneurial freedom – freedom to produce, trade and invest.The essence of state regulation in the economy is not in increasing administrative tools, not in state expansion in individual industries (we have already gone through this, and it was ineffective), and not in supporting selected enterprises and market participants, but in protecting private initiatives and all forms of property.The government’s tasks are to fine-tune the work of state institutions that ensure the work of the market. We will not be able to achieve stable development without a truly independent legal system and an effective system of law-enforcement bodies.I want to particularly stress this: no national programme will be successful if we do not ensure a single economic and legal space. This is an axiom for a federal nation. But even now, there are restrictions on economic activity in the county, and we see them coming from everywhere – from federal, regional and local power bodies.Federal power is responsible for common conditions of economic activity in the country. But territorial bodies still often introduce bans on export of grain, restrict trade of alcohol, and hinder banks that are not “theirs” from opening branches. Barriers are created to free circulation of capital, goods and services. This is an absolute disgrace! It seems to be profitable. In fact, it leads to catastrophe. In Europe, many nations agreed in Rome in 1957 on free movement of goods, people and services. This all works well. But we cannot achieve this within a single country.Any actions by regional powers directed to limiting economic freedom must be stopped as unconstitutional. Officials responsible for this should be punished. Regions should not compete for authority, but for attracting investment and labour resources. This can only be done by improving, not by worsening conditions of economic activity.It must be admitted that the state will not be able to stop participation in several sectors of our economy for some time yet. I mean direct participation by the state. It will not be able to, and should not stop – in sectors such as the defence and industrial complex, for example. Strategically important industries will remain under the constant attention of the state.Dear deputies, members of the Federation Council,Unfortunately, the business climate in our country is improving too slowly, and remains unfavourable. Taxes and entrepreneurial risks are high. Mechanisms of registering enterprises are complex, and checks are endless. The functions of bodies of state administration have in a number of cases been combined with the functions of commercial organizations. This situation is intolerable and must be changed. More active work is needed from the Government, and the Prime Minister. We know that in some central departments there is a direct combination of economic and administrative functions. This is absolutely unacceptable. It goes against common sense and the existing legislation.Firstly, protection of property rights needs to be ensured. The state will guarantee shareholders access to information about the activity of enterprises, and restrict the possibility of “laundering” their capital, and asset withdrawal. Citizens’ property rights need to be protected, and their guarantees ensured of ownership of housing, land, bank holdings, and other movable and immovable property. It is important to establish the legal bases of the right to private property in areas where it has not yet been confirmed, above all on land and real-estate. These issues are serious ones. They need to be approached carefully, and we need to move towards solutions. These issues are an area of joint work between the Government and the Federal Assembly.The second area is ensuring equality of conditions of competition. Today the state puts some enterprises in a profitable position – tariffs on energy resources are lower for them, they are allowed not to pay debts, and they enjoy numerous privileges. But other enterprises, working in formally equal conditions, are discriminated against, and essentially pay for the privileges of the former. Therefore, all unjustified privileges and preferences should be cancelled, direct and indirect subsidies to enterprises. Whatever the justifications for them are. Justifications will always be found. It is necessary to ensure an equal approach in distributing state funds, licenses, quotas, and do away with the selective use of bankruptcy procedure. This is an extremely important and very painful sphere of state activity. In some regions, it has simply become a tool for squaring accounts with political and economic rivals.The third area is freeing entrepreneurs from administrative pressure. The state should gradually stop the practice of excessive interference in business.The ability of officials to act as they see fit, and arbitrarily interpret legislative norms in both the centre and the regions oppresses entrepreneurs and creates an environment for corruption. We need to ensure that laws of direct action are applied, to reduce department instructions to a minimum, and remove ambiguity in interpreting normative documents. And furthermore, to simplify the procedure of registering enterprises, expert examination, coordinating investment projects and so on. Many people here today probably know what this entails, and have done this themselves or observed how these issues are solved in this country.The fourth area is reducing the tax burden. Today, the tax system is conducive to mass tax avoidance, moving the economy into the shadows, reducing investment activity, and ultimately causing a drop in the competitiveness of Russian business. This means a drop in the competitiveness of the Russian state. The first step to reform the tax system has been made: Let us move further along this path. If you have noticed, I am returning to this problem for the third time.The current customs system can also not be called effective. There is a myth that by manipulating tariffs, you can protect Russian commodity producers. To be quite honest, I also used to think this myself. However, with the current level of customs administration, and I want to stress this, this system to a large degree only protects and encourages corruption. So the customs system needs to be simplified fundamentally, and tariffs need to be unified.The fifth area is the development of the financial infrastructure. The bank system should be freed of ineffective organizations. There should be transparency of banking activity. The stock market should become an effective mechanism for mobilizing investments, and directing them to the most promising sectors of the economy.The sixth area is a realistic social policy. I say the sixth area, although in its importance it could of course have been put in first place. A policy of general state paternalism is economically impossible and politically inadvisable today. Rejecting this is dictated by the need for the most effective use of financial resources, and to create stimuli for development, to liberate human potential, and make people responsible for themselves and for the welfare of their families.Social policy is not just aid for the needy, but also investment in the future of people, in their health, and in their professional, cultural, and personal development. This is why we will give priority to developing the spheres of health, education and culture.The current system of social welfare, which is founded on non-specific social benefits and privileges, is organized in such a way that it scatters state funds, and allows rich people to enjoy social benefits at the expense of the poor. Formally, free education and health is actually paid for, and often inaccessible for the poor, child benefits are low and not paid for years, and pensions are meagre and not tied to real incomes.The state lie has become firmly established, and it will probably be appropriate to talk of this now that we have all gathered here: we pass numerous laws, knowing in advance that they are not provided for by real financing. We make various decisions simply because of the political situation. We have no other choice but to reduce excessive social obligations and strictly follow the ones we keep. Only this way can we restore the people’s trust in the state.A very important national task is to ensure the financial stability of the pension system. The state is obliged to prevent a crisis caused by the swift ageing of Russia’s population. To achieve this, it is necessary to introduce mechanisms of accumulative financing of pensions. We need to move to this system, carefully, step by step, but we definitely need to move in this direction. Social policies will be conducted on the principles of accessibility and acceptable quality of basic social benefits. And they will above all provide help to those whose incomes are significantly lower than the subsistence level. Ministers’ children can do without children’s benefits, and bankers’ wives can do without unemployment benefits.Dear colleagues,We have convinced ourselves: the authorities’ indecision and the weakness of the state will bring economic and other reforms to nothing. The authorities must be guided by the law and the single executive power vertical that is formed in accordance with it.We have created separate “islands” of power, but have not built reliable bridges between them. We have yet to build effective cooperation between different levels of power. We have talked a great deal about this. The centre and the territories, regional and local authorities are still competing among each other, competing for power. And their often mutually destructive fight is observed by those for whom disorder and corruption is advantageous, who make use of the lack of an effective state for their own goals. And some would like to keep this situation in the future.The power vacuum has led to state functions being seized by private corporations and clans. They have acquired their own shadowy groups, groups of influence, dubious security services which use illegal means to receive information.At the same time, state functions and state institutions differ from entrepreneurial ones in that they should not be bought or sold, privatized or transferred for use or lease. Professionals are needed in state service, for whom the only criterion of activity is the law. Otherwise, the state is opening the path of corruption. And the moment may come when it is simply transformed, and ceases to be democratic.This is why we insist on a single dictatorship – the dictatorship of the Law. Although I know that many people do not like this expression. This is why it is so important to indicate the limits of the area where the state is the full and only owner. To clearly say where it is the final arbiter and to indicate the spheres where it should not become involved.The engine of our policy should become enterprising and responsible federal bodies of executive power. The basis of their authority is the constitutional obligation to ensure the transparency of the executive power vertical, a state mandate of trust that is gained as a result of democratic Presidential elections, and a common strategy of domestic and foreign policy.But without coordinated work with regional and local authorities, the federal bodies of power will not achieve anything. Local power should also become effective. Essentially, this involves gathering all state resources to implement a common strategy for the country’s development.It must be admitted – federal relations in Russia are incomplete and undeveloped. Regional independence is often interpreted as a sanction for disintegration of the state. We talk about the federation and its consolidation all the time, and have been talking about this for years. However, it must be admitted: we still do not have a full federal state. I want to stress this: we do have a decentralized state.When the Russia Constitution was passed in 1993, federal statehood was seen as a worthy goal, which it was necessary to work on thoroughly. At the beginning of the 1990s, the centre gave the regions a great deal. It was a conscious policy, although to a certain extent made without any choice. But it helped the Russian leadership to achieve the most important thing, and I think it was justified: it helped to keep the Federation within its borders. This must be admitted. It is always easier to criticize what happened before us.However, the authorities in certain subjects of the Federation soon began to feel the stability of central power. And they quickly made a response. But I want to draw your attention to the fact that the reaction came not from the centre, not from Moscow, but from cities and villages. Bodies of local self-administration also began to take powers on themselves, mainly the powers of Federation subjects this time. Now all levels of power suffer from this disease. To break this vicious circle is our common, sacred task.An extreme example of unsolved federal problems is Chechnya. The situation in the republic has become so difficult that its territory has become a platform for the expansion of terrorism into Russia. The initial reason here was also the lack of state unity. And Chechnya in 1999 reminded us of mistakes made in the past. And only an anti-terrorist operation could overcome the threat of the collapse of Russia, and professional military helped to maintain the state’s dignity and integrity. They deserve our deepest respect. But at what price…Dear members of the Federation Council,Dear State Duma deputies,One of our first steps in strengthening federalism was the creation of federal districts and the appointment of representatives of the Russian President to them. The essence of this decision was not in consolidating the regions, as this is sometimes perceived or portrayed, but in consolidating the structures of the Presidential vertical of power in the territories. It was not designed to change administrative and territorial borders, but to increase the effectiveness of power. Not to weaken regional power, but to create conditions to consolidate federalism.I want to particularly stress: with the creation of districts, federal power did not get further away from the territories, it got closer.Public opinion ascribes dangerous intentions to the President’s federal representatives. They are supposed to be both “swords of vengeance” and bureaucratic intermediaries between the centre and the regions. In fact, by reducing the staff of federal officials in the regions, we want to ensure they are mobile and competent. By clearly defining the limits of jurisdiction of the federal representatives, we make their work transparent for regional administrations and the population of territories. By reducing doubled-up functions, we personify responsibility. This decision undoubtedly reinforces the unity of the country.Federal representatives will of course assist in effectively solving the problems of their districts. But they do not have the right to intrude on the sphere of competence of the elected heads of regions. In their work, representatives will be guided by the law alone and the powers given by the law.Our second step determines the possibility of federal intervention in situations when local bodies of power infringe the Russian Constitution and federal laws, and violate the common rights and freedoms of Russian citizens.In the territories today, a state body of official can refuse to carry out a court decision that declares a law or another normative legal document to be unconstitutional or contrary to federal legislation. It can continue to use documents that a court declared to be invalid. This is the practice of our lives, all around. This abasement of the Russian legal system as one of the federal authorities that acts on the basis of the Constitution is intolerable. This is in fact the external manifestation of what I have been talking about. The state here is not federal, but decentralized. Federal power and the Russian President should have the legal ability to establish order here. And regional leaders should have the right to influence local power bodies if they make unconstitutional decisions and infringe on citizens’ rights. We must not weaken the powers of regional authorities. This is the link on which federal power must rely.But these institutions of intervention exist in many federal states. They are used very rarely, but their existence is a reliable guarantee of precise implementation of the Constitution and federal laws. In fact, even now, at the discussion stage of this problem, the Russian regions have already begun to establish order. We can see clear results in certain territories.Our next step is reform of the Federation Council. And this is also a step towards the development of democracy, and professional foundations of parliamentary activity.Changing the principles of forming the Federation Council poses the question of organizing permanent dialogue between leaders of subjects of the Russian Federation and heads of state on the main problems of state life, on a form of regional participation in preparing and passing important national decisions. This form may become the State Council under the Russian President, which has been discussed by some governors, and as the President, I am prepared to support it. I would also like to mention another problem – the war of mayors and heads of municipal formations with regional leaders, which we can see everywhere. Only in rare cases can this war be seen as an assertion of the interests of local self-administration as an institution of power. Local self-administration still begin too often with mayors and ends with them. And thus, personal ambitions and attempts to gain more power should not be confused with protecting people’s real interests.Increasing the responsibility of leaders of Federation subjects and legislative assemblies should be accompanied by an increase of responsibility among heads of municipal formations. Of course, this does not deny the necessity of further development of local self-administration. It is under the protection of the Federal Constitution and is one of the fundamental bases of Russian sovereignty of the people.Dear colleagues,Today, above all we set ourselves the task of establishing order in bodies of power. But this is not the final goal, only the first stage in state modernization. Unifying the resources of federal, regional and local authorities is necessary for solving other complex tasks. The main tasks are:Improving the political system and building an effective state as the guarantor of stable social development and observance of human rights;Bringing the capabilities of Federation subjects into line to ensure that citizens of the country have a full range of political and socio-economic rights;Creating legal guarantees of development of the Russian economy as an economy of free enterprise and business initiative for citizens, and ensuring precise and effective implementation of economic strategic throughout the territory of Russia.These three tasks will be solved consecutively to strengthen our state system. And to achieve this, we must already begin to consolidate efforts at all levels and branches of power.To conclude my speech, I would like to remind you that everyone in state service has a responsibility to the state and to all of Russian society. This responsibility is specified by mandate for deputies, governors and members of Government. Despite the difference in their positions, they all have a common debt. It is a debt to the people, a debt to our country.In Russia today, promises are not enough. Promises have been made many times, and they have all passed their expiry date. Decades of difficult and unstable life are a long enough time to demand real changes for the better. The Russian government must achieve changes soon. We all understand how difficult it is to achieve this goal. But I am certain that we have enough sense and will.If this is so, there will be a result.And then we will have stability and national progress.Russia will have success and prosperity.Thank you very much for your attention.",2000
