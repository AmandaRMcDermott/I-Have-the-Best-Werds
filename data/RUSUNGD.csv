RUS,1971,"82.	 First of all, Mr. President, I should like to congratulate you on your election to the high office of President of the General Assembly of the United Nations and to wish you success in carrying out the responsible tasks which lie before you.",UNGD
RUS,1971,83.	The international situation in which the twenty-sixth session of the United Nations General Assembly has been convened is complex and variegated. There is undeniably much in it; which is new and which meets the aspirations of the peoples; but the opposite trends are strong and the world is not free from danger. The situation is shaped by the policies of States and is by no means simple.,UNGD
RUS,1971,"84.	In analyzing the foreign policy of any State, what we have to determine above all else is whether that State regards the task of strengthening world peace as the focal point of its policy, or whether it gives preference to other objectives which may not correspond to the interests of peace and may even run counter to those interests,",UNGD
RUS,1971,"85.	The position of principle of our socialist State on questions of foreign policy was already determined at the time of its inception. Since then, for over half a century, it has never deviated from that policy. It has always done everything in its power to consolidate the security of the peoples and to ensure respect for their rights. It has condemned wars of aggression and annexation and holds the banner of peace firmly in its hands. The Soviet Union will continue to use all its authority, all its resources, its policy and its ideology to influence the course of international events in the direction of peace among the nations.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"86.	A policy aimed at worsening the situation and leading to tension, conflicts and international crises is organically alien to us and is rejected by the very nature of the socialist order. At the same time, we shall continue to resist all attempts to pursue such a policy against our country and against our allies and friends.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"87.	The general line of the foreign policy of the USSR, which was evolved and bequeathed to us by Lenin, was confirmed and adapted to the circumstances of today by the Twenty-fourth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The Congress carefully weighed and appraised the most important directions and trends of world developments and advanced a broad program of peace and peaceful co-operation.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"88.	This program covers all the main aspects of the task of maintaining peace, from the elimination of existing hotbeds of war and the prevention of new conflicts between States to the implementation of the principle of collective security, from measures to ensure a military detente in the areas of the most dangerous confrontations to the prohibition of ail types of weapons of mass destruction, and from the final elimination of colonialism and racism to the development of mutually advantageous co-operation between States in solving major economic, scientific and technological problems.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"89.	We make no secret of our feelings of satisfaction at the world-wide acclaim given to the program of peace and co-operation advanced by the Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. All those who show concern for peace, irrespective of their class and ideological outlook, consider this program to be constructive and realistic and to meet the interests of all, peoples. The Soviet Union's efforts in the sphere of foreign affairs are being concentrated on the preparation and execution of measures to give effect to the proposals contained in the program.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"90.	Our country is acting in concert with the other socialist States in solving the problem of building a more stable world. Our alliance with them is firm, and the policy of its members is directed towards securing the most advantageous conditions for building up socialism and communism in their countries, a task for which the main prerequisite is peace.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"91.	The foreign policy objectives of the socialist alliance coincide with the interests of all peoples and with the purposes solemnly proclaimed in the United Nations Charter. No one is more concerned than we are to ensure that the lofty principles of the United Nations are brought into effect through peaceful relations between States and peoples, .irrespective of their social systems and political structures.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"92.	But the socialist countries neither claim nor want to monopolize the policy of peace. On the contrary, the wider the circle of States defending the cause of peace and actively helping to find solutions for acute international problems, the mora opportunities there will be to forge ahead and the greater will be the confidence in success, however difficult the road to stable security may be and whatever obstacles may have to be overcome.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"93.	This circle of States has now widened, because the facts of our times are forcing all States into the realization that in spite of the social, political, economic or cultural differences between them, it is in their common interest to ensure that people can live in peace.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"94.	The ways in which States express this realization may vary, but its meaning is always the same. It underlies the foreign policies of the socialist States. It is the main guideline of the policy of countries which call themselves non-aligned. It is manifested in the trends towards realism which have recently become more evident in the policy of a considerable number of other States which only a short time ago automatically adjusted their attitudes to the positions of the military blocs into which they had been drawn in the past. That is why in recent years the alienation and even antagonism between States belonging to different social systems has in a number of cases given way to relations based on mutual understanding.",UNGD
RUS,1971,95.	None of this can in any way eliminate the historic confrontation between socialism and imperialism or make less acute the struggle between the two opposing directions in world politics to which we have often referred from this important world platform. But the strengthening of the principle of peaceful coexistence as a real force of international development and the further redeployment of political forces on the international scene in favor of peace can shape to a large extent the relations between States.,UNGD
RUS,1971,"96.	If the development of the situation in different parts of the world is compared from this point of view, then it is Europe that attracts most attention. On that continent, where both world wars began, where in the post-war years a dangerous and prolonged confrontation took place between two opposing political systems and two armed camps emerged, 'there are now signs of developments and trends towards a relaxation of tension.",UNGD
RUS,1971,97.	The recently signed Quadripartite Agreement on problems concerning West Berlin will serve to eliminate one of the most dangerous sources of tension and friction and to improve the atmosphere in an unhealthy area of European politics. The Soviet Union has long and consistently pursued this objective.,UNGD
RUS,1971,"98.	As we know, neither of the German States participated directly in the negotiations between the four Powers,",UNGD
RUS,1971,but they were constantly consulted and much depended on them. It is now for the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany to complete the negotiations between them which are provided for in the four- Power agreement. We should like to express the hope that this stage of the settlement of the question of West Berlin will also be successful.,UNGD
RUS,1971,"99.	Mutual understanding and agreement between two continental European Powers, the Soviet Union and France, has become one of the main pillars of peace in Europe. These relations were given considerable impetus by the Soviet-French Protocol on Consultations, which was signed a year ago  and which during this short time has proved to be an effective instrument of political co-operation. We are in favor of raising the relations between the two Powers to an even higher level, in the interests of European peace and international security.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"100.	In the Federal Republic of Germany, the forces which evaluate the situation more soberly and have declared themselves in favor of a policy of peace and a peaceful future are showing more confidence than in the past and gaining the, upper hand. The objectives consistently pursued by the socialist States of Europe in their relations with the Federal Republic of Germany have thus become attainable.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"101.	The treaties concluded with the Federal Republic of Germany by the USSR 3 and the Polish People's Republic,  which are based on recognition of European realities, especially on the inviolability of frontiers, meet the interests of all European States. We expect them to be ratified and to enter into force in the near future.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"102.	Next on the list is the settlement of relations between the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, based on the recognition of the invalidity ab initio of the Munich agreement, and on the normalization of relations between the two countries on the basis of respect for the principles of sovereignty and equal rights in their relations among themselves and with other States.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"103.	If the Federal Republic of Germany makes a final break with the disastrous legacy of its past in favor of a peaceful future, no one can cast doubt on the place it should occupy in Europe and in European policy. Another reason why this should be mentioned is the unceasing activity in the Federal Republic of Germany of those forces which look to the past instead of to the future and desire above all to turn West German foreign policy back to its former course of hostility against other countries and peoples, a course which endangers peace and holds oiit'fRT"" prospects for the Federal Republic of Germany itself.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"104.	We must dwell on yet another aspect of the question, one that has a direct bearing on the United Nations. The, fact that the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany are still not Members of the United Nations is a political anomaly. The reason for this does not",UNGD
RUS,1971,"lie in any objective difficulty in solving this problem, but in the unrealistic, discriminatory attitude of certain Powers towards the German Democratic Republic. But the time is definitely past when some people pretended that this State did not exist and that they did not know what its correct name was.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"105.	The German Democratic Republic has firmly established itself as a real and active component of the European system of States. To be more precise, it is no longer possible to imagine modern Europe without it. But since that is the case, it is time to remove the artificial obstacles which lie in the way of the admission of the German Democratic Republic to the United Nations. We are also in favor of the simultaneous admission of the Federal Republic of Germany to the United Nations.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"106.	As we know, in the communique on the recent meeting between Leonid Dyich Brezhnev, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and Mr. W. Brandt, Federal Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic declared their intention to promote that very solution of the problem.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"107.	What has been and is being done in Europe is significant, but by no means exhausts all the outstanding problems. There are questions which all the European States must settle together, and that is the underlying idea of the well-known proposal of the socialist countries on the convening of an all-European conference on problems of security and co-operation, in which the United States of America and Canada could also take part.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"108.	On meeting together, the participants in such a conference could achieve a great deal in the interests of consolidating peace in Europe. Renunciation of the use of force in relations between European States and the expansion of economic, trade, scientific and technical and cultural ties between all these States are requirements dictated by our times, and the solution of these problems should be within the capacity of the conference. This is now recognized by everyone, or nearly everyone, in Europe.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"109.	The problem of convening an all-European conference is ripe for solution; this is now obvious, no one questions it, and the problem now is to move from the preparatory to the practical stage of the work.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"110.	The problem of relaxing military tension in Europe also insistently demands solution. This is one of the most important problems. The military potential of the opposing sides in Europe has been growing for many years, and though neither the Soviet Union nor the socialist countries were responsible for this, 'they have been obliged to participate in the race. The existing political tension has been adduced as the reason, but we have always regarded this argument as dubious. Now that a certain relaxation may be observed in Europe, there is no longer any room for such assertions, if we wish to face the truth rather than try to base our policy on deception of the peoples.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"111.	Reactions to the Soviet Union's proposal to begin negotiations on the reduction of armaments and armed forces in Europe show that many are in favor of this proposal. Accordingly, what we must do is set to work.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"112.	The convening of an all-European conference and the progress made towards a military detente in Europe should bring us closer to the solution of the problem of eliminating military blocs in Europe. This would lead to a thorough and comprehensive improvement of the situation. Let the fervent advocates of the policy of military blocs not faint at the thought of such a proposal. While such blocs continue to exist, the danger of a military confrontation between States will also continue to exist.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"113.	It may be difficult to achieve this goal at once, although the socialist countries have stated on more than one occasion that they would be prepared to agree forthwith to the elimination of military blocs, or, to begin with, of their military organizations. But even if we have to proceed step by step in this direction, the elimination of military blocs in Europe now seems to be attainable in principle, and this too is something new on the horizon of European politics.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"114.	Of course, the task of improving the international situation is not limited to Europe. For all the importance of the relations between States in Europe and for all the influence of European events on the general world situation, the prevention of a new world war depends not only on them, but also on relations in general between States in all regions. When the United Nations Charter speaks of the obligation ""to develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples"", it does not distinguish between European and Asian nations or between American and African nations. Universal peace can be based only on peaceful relations between all nations.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"115.	The settlement and development of friendly relations between any countries calls for good will, mutual interest and common peaceful intentions on their part. When these conditions are present and when countries entering into closer relations with each other do so in the context of a common concern for the strengthening of international peace, it is possible to achieve results which benefit not only the countries in question, but the world as a whole.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"116.	The treaties of friendship and co-operation which the Soviet Union recently concluded with the Arab Republic of Egypt  and with the Republic of India  may serve as examples. Both instruments are widely regarded as important stages in the development of friendly Soviet-Egyptian and Soviet-Indian relations, as well as significant factors in the general construction of a more stable peace. We are convinced that this is a correct appraisal.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"117.	We attach great importance to the development of our relations with Italy, Canada, with which we have concluded a Protocol on Consultations, Algeria, Iran, Afghanistan and Finland, with such an important Asian Power as Japan and with other countries of Europe, Asia, Africa, Latin America and Oceania. We make no exceptions for anyone and our attitude towards the development of contacts and ties between other countries is the same: the closer these are, the more purposefully they are integrated in the general system of efforts to strengthen peace, the more the forces of aggression will be held in check and the greater will be the benefit to the peoples.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"118.	Much has been said recently about the intended normalization of relations between the United States of America and the People's Republic of China. In principle we regard this as a natural development. Normal relations should exist between all States. So far as the position of the Soviet Union is concerned, we have always consistently opposed any unlawful action in respect of the Chinese island of Taiwan, any deprivation of the People's Republic of China of its legitimate rights in the United Nations, the concept of ""two Chinas"" and any notion of a ""dual representation of China"". This is our position of principle, and we shall uphold it at this session of the General Assembly.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"119.	But the Soviet Union opposes now as before any policy which is directed against the legitimate interests and security ,of other States, including the Soviet Union, however such a policy may be camouflaged. In the past, States combined into many antagonistic groups, which led to international complications and sometimes even to wars. Yet in the end such actions always backfired against those States which had initiated and participated in them, whether they were large States or small. The generation of people who saw such combinations has not yet died out.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"120.	The Soviet Union's approach to its relations with the United States of America is also based on the strengthening of peace. We attach due importance to these relations, being aware that they affect international affairs as a whole. The Soviet Union is willing to develop its political contacts and economic, trade, scientific and technical and cultural ties with the United States of America, just as it is with any other State. We are prepared to seek mutually acceptable solutions. But in doing so we are not prepared to adapt our principles in international matters, our firm policy of peace, to any considerations of the moment. The steps we take in our relations with the United States of America are always in keeping with our general line of action in the interests of peace. Speaking at the Twenty-fourth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev laid special emphasis on the following:",UNGD
RUS,1971,"""We proceed from the premise that it is possible to improve relations between the USSR and the United States. Our position of principle with regard to the capitalist countries, including the United States of America, lies in the consistent and comprehensive practical implementation of the principles of peaceful coexistence, the development of mutually advantageous relations and, in the case of States which are prepared for this, co-operation towards the strengthening of peace, by making our relations with them as stable as possible. But we have to consider whether we are confronted by a sincere wish to solve problems at the negotiating table or by attempts to pursue a policy from a 'position of strength'.""",UNGD
RUS,1971,"121.	However great the power of the Soviet Union may be, we have never used it and never will use it to place our country above others. Nor do we generally accept the division of States into categories according to their sign or military might. The Charter of the United Nations is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of its Members and we fully subscribe to this principle.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"122.	Violation of the principles of equal rights, respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States and non-interference in their internal affairs and attempts by more powerful States to impose their will on those which they consider to be weaker inevitably lead to critical situations and conflicts. This is the course which is always followed by aggressors.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"123.	Is this not essentially what is going on in Indo-China and the Middle East, which have been hotbeds of war for many years?",UNGD
RUS,1971,"124.	Statements have been made recently in Washington concerning the intention to withdraw American troops from Indo-China. Information is published practically every week about the number of thousands by which the American forces have been reduced. But the war in Viet-Nam, Laos and Cambodia is continuing, and the scope of military operations even expands from time to time. The United States of America and its hirelings are continuing the war.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"125.	The point is not the percentage of American soldiers in the area, but the number of local troops, and whether they are being trained, armed and sent into battle under orders from Washington. The point is that the United States of America should cease its military and political interference in the affairs of Indo-China and its efforts to impose an order of its own choosing in that area Ly force of arms.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"126.	The world now understands full well that from the very outset, right was on the side of the patriots of Viet-Nam, Laos and Cambodia. Now that information which was formerly carefully concealed has become known, there is simply no more room for discussion about who unleashed the war in Indo-China and with what ends in view. It is also obvious whose fault it is that the Paris negotiations were brought to a deadlock.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"127.	In these circumstances, the new proposals for the establishment of peace which have been advanced by the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam and have been supported by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam acquire even greater importance. These proposals are imbued with a constructive spirit and are directed towards finding a rational solution for the practical problems which arise.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"128.	Not only the friends of the Viet-Namese people, but all those who can assess the situation objectively see these proposals as a realistic way out of the prevailing situation. But what is it about them that the United States of America does not like? Why does the United States of America continue the war when all the conditions for peace are there? Why is the bombing of the territory of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam continuing and being intensified of late, although as we know the cessation of this bombing in 1968 was a prerequisite for the beginning",UNGD
RUS,1971,"of the Paris negotiations for. a political settlement? These are questions which arise from the logic of events, and they require an answer.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"129.	Where the Soviet Union is concerned, our country, resolutely supporting the proposals for a peaceful settlement and pursuing its international duty, will continue to provide all the necessary support to the fraternal VietNamese people and to the peoples of and Cambodia in their legitimate struggle for their rights.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"130.	Events in the Middle East centre round the same problem: will the legitimate rights of the Arab States which have suffered aggression be respected, will the territories annexed by force be returned, or will the policy of aggression be allowed to triumph?",UNGD
RUS,1971,"131.	Israel and its protectors are obviously counting on the latter alternative. That is why they have paralyzed the mission of the Special Representative of the Secretary- General of the United Nations, who was entrusted with the task of promoting a political settlement in accordance with the well-known decision of the Security Council. That is why the consultations between the four Powers which are permanent members of the Security Council are just marking time, since to be effective they require the co-operation of all the participants.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"132.	But Israel has miscalculated. The policy-makers of that country have made their expansionist schemes too evident to receive any support on the international scene. Now no one can believe the claim that Israel is defending its ""existence"". One by one, the false arguments with which Israel's rulers have tried to cover up the real objective of their policy have fallen to the ground.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"133.	Israel has refused to relinquish the occupied territories until the Arab countries agree to put an end to the state of war, yet the Arabs are prepared to agree to this.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"134.	Israel has insisted that a treaty of peace should be concluded and the Arab States do not object to this either, provided, of course, that all the occupied territories are returned to them.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"135.	Israel has expressed anxiety about its security. It is now clear that, as part of a political settlement in the Middle East, the appropriate guarantees, including those of the Security Council, can be given. These are the firmest guarantees that can be imagined in the modern world.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"136.	No one can now have any doubts: Israel does not want peace, or if it does, then it must be an annexationist peace. But this is contrary to the United Nations Charter and to the most elementary principles of international law, and must therefore be rejected.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"137.	Israel's rulers apparently believe that since they have been able to hold on to the occupied territories for four years, that situation can be maintained indefinitely. But they must be aware of the alternative to a political settlement in the Middle East!",UNGD
RUS,1971,138.	Is the United Nations capable of contributing to the solution of the problem of a Middle Eastern settlement?,UNGD
RUS,1971,"Yes, it will be capable of this if it does not limit itself to adopting yet another resolution expressing pious hopes unsupported by practical measures and if it makes use of all the possibilities afforded it by the United Nations Charter.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"139.	The Soviet Union wants to see peace in the Middle East. It will continue to support the Arab States which have suffered aggression and their efforts to liberate their territories. The just cause of the Arab peoples, including the people of Palestine, must prevail.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"140.	Indo-China and the Middle East are not the only sources of military danger. In some other parts of Asia tension is not only not declining, but is even increasing. The situation in the area of the Indo-Pakistan subcontinent is becoming increasingly complex. It must be admitted that India has cause for concern at the turn which events have taken in East Pakistan. The flow of refugees into India has given rise to serious difficulties and problems which are not only economic. We are convinced that a political settlement of the problems which have arisen in East Pakistan is the only means of achieving a general relaxation of tension in that region. Moreover, all the States of the region must be associated with such a settlement. The refugees must be returned to East Pakistan, and this will become possible only when their safety there is ensured. The present situation in the area is acute, and this is not merely a domestic problem. The Soviet Government would like to express the hope that this situation will not lead to a military conflict between the States of the region an.: that restraint and reason will prevail.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"141.	The peoples of Asia need lasting peace and a situation in which their resources and efforts are not dissipated in conflict, but are directed towards the solution of social and economic problems on which the raising of their standard of living, of their economy and culture, primarily depends.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"142.	It will be recalled that the Soviet Union put forward the idea of establishing a system of collective security in Asia which would ensure a state of stability on that continent. Time and effort may be needed to put that idea into practice, but the situation which has arisen in Asia requires that such efforts should be made and should be pursued consistently.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"143.	Another essential condition for normalizing the situation in Asia is to put an end to interference in the internal affairs of the Korean people. The United Nations, for its part, should stop serving as a screen concealing the foreign occupation of South Korea. That is the purpose of the proposals submitted to the General Assembly by a number of socialist and non-aligned States concerning the withdrawal of United States and all other foreign troops from South Korea and the dissolution of the so-called United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea. We can only regret that the consideration of these questions, which require immediate solution, has been deferred until the next session of the General Assembly. Such an approach in no way helps to reduce tension in the Korean area. On the other hand, we note with satisfaction that during the discussion of the question whether the items concerning Korea should be included in the agenda of the current session of the General",UNGD
RUS,1971,"Assembly, some 30 countries spoke against the clumsy maneuvers of those who are afraid of a broad consideration at this session of the topical questions of the withdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea and of the dissolution of the so-called United Nations Commission.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"144.	If we are to choose an area of international relations in which the interests of all States coincide and in which an impulse by the United Nations is particularly necessary to speed up progress, such an area is that of questions relating to the cessation of the arms race and to disarmament.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"145.	The arms race is fraught with new and unknown dangers and its adverse effects on the life of our society are now more profound and more dangerous than ever before. During the post-war years, the money spent on armaments has been several times greater than the total annual national income of all the developing countries in the world. This waste of material and intellectual resources is taking place at a time when many millions of people have no bread to satisfy their hunger and no roofs over their heads to shelter them from rain and cold and when over one third of the population of our planet are illiterate.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"146.	It would be wrong to say that nothing has been done to check the arms race. Nuclear weapons tests in the air, in outer space and under water have been prohibited, the proliferation of these weapons among States has been stopped, and the siting of weapons of mass destruction in outer space, on celestial bodies and on the sea-bed and the ocean floor has been prevented. The conviction is growing that the solution of the problem of banning underground nuclear tests can no longer be postponed. The ideas of the creation of nuclear-free zones in various parts of the world and of the elimination of foreign military bases in the territories of others are gaining increasing support.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"147.	Efforts for the prohibition and destruction of bacteriological weapons are proceeding in the right direction. Negotiations for an appropriate convention are nearing conclusion. This should be an important practical step not only in limiting the arms race, but also in actual disarmament. We are dealing here with the elimination of one specific type of weapon and, moreover, a weapon of mass"" destruction. The task of also prohibiting and eliminating chemical weapons lies ahead.",UNGD
RUS,1971,148.	There has been growing awareness recently of the need to take measures to prevent the accidental occurrence or deliberate provocation of incidents involving the use of nuclear weapons. This purpose is served by the agreement reached recently between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America.,UNGD
RUS,1971,"149.	The talks between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America on the limitation of strategic arms are continuing and are now concentrated on the preparation of an agreement on anti-missile systems. Unless the expansion of anti-missile defense is halted now, a chain reaction Of competition between offensive and defensive weapons will inevitably take place, as it did in the past between naval armor and the artillery shell, the difference being that this competition would be immeasurably more dangerous and more costly.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"150.	The successful outcome of these talks would serve the interests of the peoples of both the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America, as well as the cause of strengthening universal peace. In view of the increasing importance of the talks, the Soviet side is intensifying its efforts to reach agreement, which must of course be based on the principle of equal security. But the success of the talks also depends to the same extent on the other side.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"151.	Achievements in limiting the arms race are only the first steps towards disarmament. However important they may be, to stop there would be to shirk the solution of the basic problem. And we are convinced that, from the point of view of what is possible, it can be solved. The whole question is whether there Is a desire for such a solution.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"152.	The Soviet Union recently advanced a proposal to convene a conference of the five Powers possessing nuclear weapons-the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United States of America, the People's Republic of China, France and the United Kingdom-with a view to examining questions of nuclear disarmament. One of the nuclear Powers we approached, France, supported this Soviet initiative. But then another announced its opposition, whereupon the remaining two hastened to declare that in the existing circumstances the convening of a conference of the five nuclear Powers had become an ""academic'' question.",UNGD
RUS,1971,153.	The Soviet Union does not consider that the other nuclear Powers have said the last word. All those who view matters realistically understand that nuclear disarmament can be achkved only with the participation and agreement of all five iiuclear Powers and that they cannot absolve themselves of this responsibility.,UNGD
RUS,1971,"154.	A radical solution of disarmament problems will, of course, call for the united efforts of all States, irrespective of the size of their territories and populations, the level of their military might and their economic potential. The Soviet Government believes that further intensification of efforts to achieve disarmament would be promoted by the convening of a world disarmament conference in which all the States in the world would participate, and that this question should be examined at the current session of the General Assembly. The relevant item has been included in the Assembly's agenda at our proposal fA18491J.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"155.	In the not-too-distant past, States have already approached the question of convening a world disarmament conference, but for various reasons it has so far proved impossible to hold such a conference. The general political situation is now more conducive to this.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"156.	It is essential to make the most of these developments, bearing in mind the fact that, although during the post-war years disarmament talks have been conducted in the widest variety of places, all States have never yet gathered together to discuss disarmament questions. Yet +his problem affects them all without exception.",UNGD
RUS,1971,157.	The universality of the world conference and the participation of all States might contribute to its success.,UNGD
RUS,1971,"158.	The tasks before the world disarmament conference would of course be enormous. That Is why it should perhaps become a permanent forum, or rather one operating over a long period. Its sessions might be convened periodically, say, once every two or three years. In view of the fact that the nuclear arms race arouses the greatest concern among the peoples, first priority should be given, if the majority of the participants in the conference express this wiJh, to questions of the prohibition and elimination of nuclear weapons, the use of which cannot be tolerated by the conscience of mankind.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"159.	The world conference should be convened outside the United Nations, so that it can be attended by all States, irrespective of whether or not they are Members of the United Nations. It is self-evident that Its convening should in no way detract from the significance of those forms of, and channels for, disarmament talks which are now being used, Including the Committee on Disarmament. On the contrary, the Committee on Disarmament should intensify its work.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"160.	Both the existing channels for negotiations and any which may be created in the future would contribute to preparations for the convening of the world disarmament conference, and later to the actual drafting of specific agreements on disarmament in pursuance of the decisions of the world confoiencc.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"161.	States must obviously be given some time to conduct the necessary consultations on questions relating to the convening of the world disarmament conference. In this connexion, we consider that the General Assembly might address an appeal to States to agree not later than 1972 on the date of the conference and on its agenda.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"162.	In view of the above considerations, the Soviet delegation hereby submits the following draft resolution for the consideration of the General Assembly:",UNGD
RUS,1971,"(The speaker then rear? out the text of a draft resolution which was subsequently circulated as document A/L.631. For the text, see Official Records of the General Assembly, Twenty-sixth session, Annexes, agenda item 97.]",UNGD
RUS,1971,163.	We believe that this draft speaks for itself. We call upon all delegations to give it due attention.,UNGD
RUS,1971,"164.	In considering all these questions, within the United Nations or outside it, no one should forget that disarmament negotiations are being conducted in circumstances where the arms race is not only continuing, but is being accelerated. This may appear to be a vicious circle, but it can and must be broken. This is demanded by the most vital interests of mankind.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"165.	Disarmament is the most reliable means of strengthening international security and ensuring peace, this is clearly expressed in the United Nations Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security which was adopted at the twenty-fifth, anniversary session of the General Assembly [resolution 2734 (XXV)], at the initiative of the Soviet Union.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"166.	The Declaration has been correctly assessed as a program of specific measures which, taken together, can",UNGD
RUS,1971,"radically change the international situation for the better. Some of its particularly significant features are that it reaffirms the principle of the inadmissibility of acquiring territories through the use of force and strongly emphasizes the obligation of all States Members of the United Nations to carry out the decisions of the Security Council and to do everything in their power to enhance the authority and effectiveness of this organ, on which the Charter confers the main responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"167.	In this connexion, we should like to state frankly that the Security Council is by no means carrying out its functions as it should under the Charter of our Organization. The founders of the United Nations envisaged the situation rather differently. They envisaged it in such a way that no one should paralyse the Council's activities and that all the States which have been trusted to become members of that organ, especially its permanent members, should carry out their obligations with a sense of responsibility, so that no violator of peace should go unpunished and so that the activities of the Security Council should be based on the agreement reached during the Second World War, when the foundations of the United Nations were laid and its structure was elaborated. We believe, however, that this situation can be remedied, if the policies of States particularly of the great Powers, are directed to the pursuit of genuinely peaceful goals.",UNGD
RUS,1971,168.	The twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly will have to consider the question of how the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security is being implemented [item 34]. It is not enough to adopt even the best possible declaration: every effort should be made to ensure that it does not become a dead letter.,UNGD
RUS,1971,"169.	Yet such a danger exists, because not all States Members of the United Nations are in practice acting in accordance with the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security for which they voted. Many of the considerations I expressed earlier can serve as examples of this.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"170.	There are yet other facts of the same kind. For example, let us take the clause of the Declaration which calls upon all States to desist from any forcible or other actions against peoples still under colonial rule and to render them assistance in their just struggle. This requirement is not being fulfilled by those very States to which it is primarily addressed.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"171.	There are different forms of colonialism and racism, but none of them is better than any other, be it the Portuguese kind, supported and sustained by the NATO military bloc, the South African kind, with its policy of hatred-apartheid, or any other kind.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"172.	And now, when the great torrent of national liberation movements has destroyed nearly all the strongholds of colonial empires, there are still people and even governments which vaunt the pseudo-civilizing action of the colonialists and are trying-in one form or another and on some pretext or other-to maintain their rule over the last colonial territories. If they think that the peoples have forgotten how much blood and sweat the policy of certain",UNGD
RUS,1971,"States has cost the peoples of Africa, Asia and other parts of the world and if they think that they will be allowed further to oppress and exploit those who still remain under their domination, they are mistaken, and history does not forgive such mistakes. The United Nations has done a good deal to help peoples in their struggle for freedom and independence. It must do even more. Colonialism must be finally eradicated.",UNGD
RUS,1971,173.	The Soviet Union is in favor of the full and unconditional implementation of United Nations decisions on the elimination of remaining colonial and racist regimes. We shall continue to provide material and political assistance and support to all the peoples striving towards that goal.,UNGD
RUS,1971,"174.	The United Nations must of course take vigorous action in all the areas provided for in its Charter. We can only welcome the fact that a number of questions arising from developments in the scientific and technical revolution will be considered during this session of the General Assembly. The Soviet Union introduced one such item into the agenda of the session, the question of the preparation of a treaty concerning the moon [A/832* J.",UNGD
RUS,1971,175.	The time has come to reach agreement on universally mandatory rules which would be binding on all States and which would ensure the study and utilization of the moon in the interests of the present and future generations for peaceful purposes only. We hope that our proposal on the conclusion of a treaty concerning the moon will receive the support of all States Members of the United Nations.,UNGD
RUS,1971,"176.	Preparations are being made for two important international conferences, one on problems of the human environment and the other on the law of the sea. The United Nations must make its contribution to these conferences, since they will be discussing questions which in modem times are closely linked with conditions of human life and the further progress of civilization.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"177.	These are new problems, arising from life itself. The United Nations is also faced with not a few old problems, which have not, however, lost their urgency for its Members, especially for the developing countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America. The problems of international economic co-operation have been discussed in the United Nations for many years, but this has not led to any improvement in the economic situation of most developing countries. That situation remains serious.",UNGD
RUS,1971,"178.	The struggle of the developing countries against one-sided, agreements and other forms of neo-colonialist oppression and lawlessness is constantly expanding. It is being conducted both by the young States which have recently gained political independence and by developing countries which ceased to be colonies long ago. The United Nations cannot stand aside from this struggle. It is in duty bound to support those who are defending their legitimate rights to liberation from economic oppression, to free national development and to labor for the well-being of their peoples, not for the profit of foreign monopolies.",UNGD
RUS,1971,179.	More than a quarter of a century has passed since the United Nations was founded. This is a considerable period.,UNGD
RUS,1971,During this time the Organization has experienced some failures. It has not always acted with sufficient resolution in cases where it should have shown firmness and energy. But on the whole it has proved that it can serve as a useful instrument of peace and development of international co-operation if it follows the right course and strictly observes the United Nations Charter.,UNGD
RUS,1971,"180.	Nevertheless, even now the question sometimes arises of the priority that should be given to certain United Nations activities. The answer was given in the days when the foundations of this Organization were established, when the Charter of the United Nations was signed. The principal task of the United Nations', the basis of all its activities, is the maintenance and strengthening of peace and the prevention of a new war. The United Nations was established for that purpose and that is its very first priority in its work. The peoples of the world evaluate the results of every session of the General Assembly and of every meeting of the Security Council by considering whether effective steps were taken towards the attainment of that essential goal. The Soviet Union, for its part, will do everything in its power to ensure the success of this session of the United Nations General Assembly.",UNGD
RUS,1971,,UNGD
RUS,1971,,UNGD
RUS,1972,"Comrade President, allow me first of all to congratulate you on your election to the high post of President of the most important international political forum, the General Assembly of the United Nations. The unanimity displayed in your election is a reflection of the respect which States Members of the United Nations have for the peace-loving policies of the Polish People's Republic and for you personally.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"39.	We should also like to congratulate the Secretary- General of the United Nations, Mr. Waldheim. Although he has occupied the post of chief administrative officer of the United Nations for less than a year, he has already shown his desire to co-operate in ensuring that the role of the United Nations in the maintenance and strengthening of peace is enhanced and its activities in the solution of this main task under the United Nations Charter expanded.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"40.	It is logical and natural for sessions of the United Nations General Assembly to begin with a general political debate. Representatives of States Members of the United Nations assess the main international events, review the results of past United Nations activities in the light of the purposes and principles proclaimed in the Charter, and set definite tasks for the future. The political impetus which the United Nations receives during the general debate is helpful in the subsequent consideration of the items on the agenda.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"41.	Even at last year's session of the General Assembly new trends were observed in relations among States which went some way towards meeting the desire of the peoples to secure lasting peace on the earth. Today there is reason to believe that these trends are growing stronger, although ",UNGD
RUS,1972,the forces opposed to a relaxation of tension in the world have not ceased their activities.,UNGD
RUS,1972,"42.	In these circumstances the United Nations should make new efforts to promote the solution of acute international problems. As a Member of the United Nations and a permanent member of the Security Council, the Soviet Union will continue to make its contribution to the cause of the struggle for peace and the transformation of the United Nations into an even more effective instrument of peace.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"43.	The Soviet State will soon celebrate its fiftieth anniversary as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The Leninist formula of the state unity of the peoples of the Soviet Union contains a powerful potential for peace- building. A profound interest in peace is organically inherent in the voluntary and equal union of socialist republic which have joined efforts in a constructive endeavor for the good of their peoples, and predatory wars and the oppression of other peoples are organically alien to such a union.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"44.	For the Soviet Union the policy of peace is an adequate reflection, in the sphere of .external relations, of its internal social nature. In the decisions of the Twenty- fourth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, our country put forward a program of peace and international co-operation which, as is universally recognized, reflects not the narrow interests of any State or group of States but the aspirations of all peoples, of all mankind. Every step taken to implement it has a constructive influence on international development as a whole.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"45.	""Our policy of principle"", as Mr. L. I. Brezhnev, the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, said, ""is the active defense of peace, freedom and the security of peoples. We are pursuing it together with our friends and allies, co-ordinating our steps in the international arena.""",UNGD
RUS,1972,"46.	If aggression is committed, the Soviet Union always sides with the victim of the aggression. If trouble threatens our allies and friends, we always come to their aid. And when we sign treaties, we implement them and fulfill our obligations.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"47.	The objectives for which the Soviet Union and all the countries of the socialist community have been tirelessly fighting for many years have taken concrete form in the positive changes which have come about in the international situation. Together with our allies and friends we shall continue to fight for peace, freedom and the progress of the peoples.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"48.	While consistently pursuing a policy of peace, the Soviet Union and the countries of the socialist community certainly do not claim to have a monopoly in this area. In the interests of peace, we are prepared to co-operate and we do co-operate with all States which are also prepared to do likewise. Whatever their social system and in whatever part of the world they may be situated, the door is closed to no one.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"49.	The broader the circle of countries pursuing a constructive foreign policy line and the larger the contribution each of them makes towards reducing tension, the more significant are the changes for the better in international affairs. Recent developments confirm this.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"50.	In the past, post-war periods have always turned out to be mere respites between wars. In the present circumstances real possibilities exist for a fundamentally different development, namely, a transition to a system of stable peace, in order to ensure which the United Nations was established.",UNGD
RUS,1972,. ,UNGD
RUS,1972,"51.	This transition requires the solution of problems engendered by the Second World War and the special features of development during the subsequent quarter of a century. If we tried to express in the most general form the essence of the changes that have taken place, we should say that it consists in the fact that there is now a possibility of solving some of these problems, while constructive work has begun with a view to settling others.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"52.	The territorial realities that have arisen in Europe, the continent where both World Wars originated, are gaining universal recognition and being formalized under international law. The entry into force of the well-known treaties concluded by the Federal Republic of Germany with the USSR, signed at Moscow on 12 August 1970, and with the Polish People's Republic, signed at Warsaw on 7 December 1970, confirms the inviolability of European boundaries, including the boundary between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany and the western boundary of Poland.",UNGD
RUS,1972,53.	The conclusion of the agreement on West Berlin eliminates a chronic source of friction between States in the very center of Europe.,UNGD
RUS,1972,"54.	The clearing of the legacy of war from European soil must be completed through the normalization of relations between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany in accordance with the requirements of observing the sovereignty and independence of both those States and settling relations between Czechoslovakia and the Federal Republic of Germany on the basis of recognizing the Munich Agreement as invalid from the very beginning. As you know, negotiations are being held on this matter and I should like to express the hope that they will have a positive outcome.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"55.	Negotiations will soon take place on the conclusion of- a peace treaty between the USSR and Japan which should play its part in closing the book on the Second World War in Asia and in providing a lasting basis for peace and co-operation on that continent as well. For our part, we shall make efforts to ensure the success of these negotiations, but the same desire must of course exist on the other side too.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"56.	On the whole the ""cold war"" is being replaced by recognition of the truth that in the nuclear age there is no other basis for relations between States having different Social systems but peaceful coexistence. More and more often this is taking the form of binding international legal documents.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"57.	The prerequisites for many-sided and equal cooperation among States, in the political and other fields, are multiplying.",UNGD
RUS,1972,58.	The high level of such co-operation attained in relations between the USSR and France is an especially conspicuous reflection of these new trends. Soviet-French relations are growing increasingly stronger and we note this with great satisfaction. The trends I have referred to are increasingly manifest in the Soviet Union's relations with a number of other States as well.,UNGD
RUS,1972,"59.	As a result of the Soviet-United States summit talks in Moscow in May of this year, a start has been made in the process of rebuilding relations between the Soviet Union and the United States of America.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"60.	-	Our country attaches great importance to its relations with the United States, a great Power wife a different social system. For our part we shall do everything in our power to develop these relations and we believe that this is in the interests of the Soviet and American peoples and in the interests of maintaining and strengthening international peace. The broadening of co-operation between the two countries has already begun to become a reality, although there remain and will remain political and ideological disagreements of principle between the Soviet Union and the United States as States having different social systems.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"61.	Naturally, we proceed from the assumption that no improvement in Soviet-United States relations should be achieved at the expense of other States. This is an important principle of our policy in relations with any State. It is our conviction that all States should be guided by this principle in their mutual relations and it is this criterion which we apply in assessing the significance of various developments in relations between different countries.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"62.	Since the first years after the Second World War, international relations have been complicated by the division of the world into military and political groupings which set some States against others and constantly carry the risk of a military conflict. The architects of the policy of establishing military blocs, pursuing the arms race and whipping up international tensions, who for a long time determined the foreign policy of the major Western capitalist Powers, worked hard to bring the world to the dangerous brink of a military conflict. Even today we are constantly encountering the consequences of that policy in various parts of the world.",UNGD
RUS,1972,63.	We can therefore scarcely over-estimate the importance of even the first steps which are now being taken to lay the foundations of security on the basis of the collective efforts of all interested States.,UNGD
RUS,1972,64.	We are now oh the eve of an all-European conference on questions of security and co-operation. Preparations for such a conference are to enter the practical phase very shortly. The great importance of this planned meeting of States lies in making Europe genuinely peaceful and in transforming relations among States on the European continent on the basis of mutual understanding and trust; we are in favor of such a policy and such a course of action in European affairs.,UNGD
RUS,1972,"65.	In the well-known Prague Declaration,  the European socialist countries have already put forward their suggestions as to how, in their view, a system of security in Europe should be built up. Many other States have also expressed their views on this score. This is a great and extremely important task and the all-European conference is expected to make an important contribution to its solution.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"66.	We are convinced that, if all interested States and Governments show a proper responsibility and a readiness to seek solutions which would be in the common interest, the conference will go down in the history of our time as a great success for the cause of peace.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"67.	In Asia, too, the idea of ensuring security, which is equally in the interests of all Asian States, is also beginning to gain ground. The Soviet Union considers the question of security in Asia to be an important task also. TTiose who, for some reason, are not now in sympathy with it should understand that the countries of Asia are no less interested than the Soviet Union in strengthening peace in that area.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"68.	Although there has been noticeable progress towards a relaxation of international tension, it is hardly likely that anyone would dispute the fact that so far only a beginning has been made and that much more remains to be done. What is more, unless further progress is made and unless the efforts to achieve greater detente are intensified, all that has been gained could be lost. There have been such cases in history.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"69.	Some of the problems awaiting solution within an international framework affect the interests of practically all States. If we consider the substance of any of the problems leading to international complications and if we focus our attention on what directly generates the danger of war and the unleashing of military conflicts, we can only come to the conclusion that it is the use of force by some States against others for the purpose of territorial annexation and for the purpose of subjugating peoples and establishing domination over them, in other words, for predatory purposes.",UNGD
RUS,1972,70 This has been true up to now and remains true today.,UNGD
RUS,1972,"71.	In the past tens and hundreds of millions of people in Asia, Africa and America were reduced to slavery by colonial force. Today, when almost all of them have freed themselves, the slightest opportunity is used to restore direct or indirect colonial domination over them.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"72.	Those who ventured in the past, and venture now, to use force for purposes which have nothing in common with the interests of the peoples are not greatly troubled by the fact that no dispute between States has ever been, or could ever be, settled on a lasting and just basis by means of force. The use of force for the purpose of aggression, territorial annexation and oppression of other peoples has as a rule laid the foundations for further hostility and further conflicts. For this the peoples have to pay, human beings perish and the great material treasures created by their toil are destroyed.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"73.	That is why progressive political leaders for almost as long as States themselves have existed have recognized the need to eliminate the use of force from relations between States. But mere understanding of this is, of course, not sufficient. Practical efforts by States are required. This is all the more necessary now that the presence and stockpiling bf nuclear weapons in the arsenals of States have radically changed the concept of the consequences which military conflicts can have for the peoples of the world.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"74.	Although varying views can be held as to the likelihood that this or that crisis or conflict will develop into a nuclear confrontation, as long as nuclear weapons exist, this possibility and this danger also exist. No State, no Government can ignore this. Our country believes that it is possible to eliminate or, at least, to reduce drastically the danger of a conflict between States provoking a nuclear catastrophe. That can be done if renunciation of the use of force in international relations is elevated to the level of international law and if at the same time-I repeat, at the same time the use of nuclear weapons js prohibited.",UNGD
RUS,1972,75.	The Soviet Government is convinced that serious consideration of these questions cannot be put off any longer. The conditions for this are already more favorable now than before and the possibilities for adopting positive decisions are broader.,UNGD
RUS,1972,"76.	For those reasons, and because it is aware of its responsibility as a permanent member of the Security Council, the Soviet Union has submitted for consideration at the twenty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly the item entitled ""Non-use of force in international relations and permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons"" [A/8793].",UNGD
RUS,1972,77.	The essence of our proposal is that it provides for the renunciation by States of any use of force to resolve international disputes; including the use both of nuclear weapons and of such types of weapons as are commonly called conventional. It is proposed that this renunciation be of such a nature that no one could avoid observing it strictly; this is possible if the United Nations shows the necessary understanding of its responsibility for the fate of the world.,UNGD
RUS,1972,"78.	Such an approach is fully in accordance with the fundamental principle proclaimed in the United Nations Charter under which the Members of the United Nations ""shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations"" [Article 2].",UNGD
RUS,1972,79. The real state of affairs in the world makes it necessary to solve the question of the non-use of force in general and the question of the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons in conjunction with each other.,UNGD
RUS,1972,"80. Ever since they first appeared, nuclear weapons have always been considered the most dangerous weapons of mass destruction. This is even truer now since the strength of these weapons is not a constant but is growing.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"81.	It would be wrong to lose sight of another aspect of the question: with the development of conventional types of weapons, the danger that they might be used in military conflicts has also increased several times even by comparison with the period of the Second World War. In the last quarter of a century nuclear weapons have not been used in military conflicts, yet who can be unaware of how many tragedies have been brought about by the use of conventional weapons and how numerous have been the victims of their use?",UNGD
RUS,1972,"82.	All this argues in favor of the prohibition of the use of force in violation of the United Nations Charter in conjunction with the prohibition of the use, first of all, of nuclear weapons, which are especially important.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"83.	The wisdom and expediency of such a decision have also been demonstrated by the experience which the United Nations has already gained in the consideration of problems of security and disarmament. The repeated attempts of the United Nations to find a solution to both these problems are fresh in everyone's memory. Attempts have been made now from one side, now from the other, now in terms of considering the question of the non-use of force, now in terms of considering the question of the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons. And what has transpired?",UNGD
RUS,1972,"84.	To take only recent years, the States Members of the United Nations have unanimously adopted a resolution on strict observance of the prohibition of the threat or use of force in international relations [resolution 2160 (XXI)], a Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations [resolution 2625 (XXV)], and a Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)].",UNGD
RUS,1972,"85.	At the real core of all these documents is the principle of the non-use of force in international relations and of the settlement of all disputes between States solely by peaceful means. All the necessary formulations have been carefully worked out and weighed on the political scales and all aspects of the problem seem to have been taken into account, but it is no secret that the goals set have still not been fully achieved; force is being used and human blood is being shed.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"86.	More than 10 years ago, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a Declaration in which it proclaimed the use of nuclear weapons to be a crime against mankind and civilization [resolution 1653 (XVI)]. Since then the United Nations has repeatedly advocated the signing of an appropriate international convention by all States. However, the Declaration on the prohibition of the: use of nuclear weapons was not supported by all the nuclear Powers and it has still not been possible to initiate productive negotiations on the conclusion of an international convention on the question.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"87.	Many reasons can be found for the ineffectiveness of the decisions adopted by the United Nations on these questions, but one of the most substantial is unarguably that they were considered and decided upon by the United Nations in isolation from one another.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"88.	When the question of prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons was raised, several States had doubts as to the possibility of taking such a step if the use of force was not precluded in relations between States. We shall not now enter into a discussion of the question of the extent to which those doubts were justified but, whatever the case, they became an obstacle to agreement.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"89.	At the same time, when the question of prohibiting the use of force was considered, the significance of any decisions adopted proved to be limited in the absence of agreement concerning nuclear weapons, that is to say, the most powerful weapons of mass destruction. The separation of one question from the other introduced a certain lack of understanding and suspicion and weakened the effectiveness of the best decisions of the United Nations. Furthermore, their effectiveness was further restricted because they were all in the form of recommendations, or, at best, declarations of intent. They were not given the force of law.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"90.	The proposal of the Soviet Union [A/8793] envisages the adoption of the most realistic and effective decision possible in modern conditions. It is precisely such a decision which is in the interests of all States, regardless of their social systems, the size of their territory and population, or whether or not they possess nuclear weapons.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"91.	As a result of such a decision, those States which are militarily stronger, and above all the nuclear Powers, will obtain greater mutual assurance that they are under no threat from one another. The security of each of them will be safeguarded more reliably and at the same time on an equal basis, that is to say, no one will gain a unilateral advantage at the expense of another in comparison with the situation which prevails at present, and no one would lose anything.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"92.	Those States which are militarily less powerful, including all those which do not possess nuclear weapons, would also gain. Now, they are justifiably concerned at the danger that nuclear weapons might be directed against them if aggression is committed. The prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons in conjunction with the renunciation of the use of force would remove this threat and greatly strengthen the security of all States.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"93.	It goes without saying that the obligation of States to renounce the use of force, including nuclear weapons, can in no way impair their right to individual and collective self-defense as laid down in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. On the contrary, that obligation would reinforce the right to self-defense against aggression and the right to struggle to eliminate the consequences of aggression in cases where it has already been committed and the aggressor seeks to benefit from it.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"94.	No one can challenge the inalienable right of States and peoples subjected to aggression to repulse it by employing all possible means so long as the aggressor continues to use force, encroaches upon their freedom and sovereignty and tries to retain territories seized by force. It will suffice to refer to the examples before everyone's eyes: Indochina and the Middle East. Who would dare to contest the incontestable fact that brute force has been and still is being used against the peoples of Indochina and against the Arab States and that they are entitled to use all the necessary means to rebuff the aggressor?",UNGD
RUS,1972,"95.	Renunciation of the use of force in relations between States in no way limits the right of the peoples of colonial countries to fight for their freedom and independence using any means which may be necessary in that struggle. This right is recognized by the United Nations as being a legitimate one. It is based on the fact that violence was used against those peoples, who have been the victims of colonialism and aggression, and, in resorting to force to liberate themselves, they are only restoring justice and their flouted rights.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"96.	The adoption of a decision on non-use of force and the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons would thus be beneficial to all. But this also makes it necessary for all States, particularly all those Powers which possess nuclear weapons, to participate in its elaboration and adoption. Otherwise no decision, not even the very best one, could attain the desired objective.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"97.	The Soviet Government has given thorough consideration to the question of the most appropriate form for a decision by the United Nations on the renunciation of the use of force in international relations and the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons. We propose that consideration of this item should result in the adoption of a clear-cut decision, which, in the interests of maximum effectiveness, should bind together appropriate actions by the two main organs of the United Nations the General Assembly and the Security Council. On behalf of the Soviet Union, the Soviet delegation is submitting the following draft resolution for consideration by the General Assembly:",UNGD
RUS,1972,"[The speaker then read out the text of a draft resolution which was subsequently circulated as document A/L.676. For the text, see Official Records of the General Assembly, Twenty-seventh session, Annexes, agenda item 25.]",UNGD
RUS,1972,"98.	The proposed draft speaks for itself. It envisages a major step on the part of the General Assembly a decision on behalf of States Members of the United Nations on their renunciation of the use or threat of force in international relations and the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons. It contains an appeal to the Security Council to take action to make this declaration binding on all States. For this purpose, and in accordance with well-known provisions of the United Nations Charter, a meeting of the Security Council should be convened at the level of members of Governments or other specially designated representatives.",UNGD
RUS,1972,99.	The Soviet delegation is authorized to state that the Soviet Union will stand ready to participate in the convening of such a meeting of the Security Council and in its work. We shall be ready to join in this political action with all other States which are permanent members of the Council. We are convinced that there can be no higher duty for those States on which the Charter of the United Nations places a special responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.,UNGD
RUS,1972,"100.	We appeal to all States represented in the General Assembly to study carefully the draft we have submitted and, on the basis ""of it, to adopt-unanimously a resolution which will reflect the firm will of this world Organization to put an end to any use of force in relations between States in violation of the United Nations Charter and to eliminate the threat of nuclear war.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"101.	In so doing, the United Nations will be giving strong support to the cause of a further relaxation of international tension, the strengthening of peace and increased mutual understanding in relations between States. This step will be in the interests of all those to whom peace, security and peaceful coexistence are not merely words but a guide for action.",UNGD
RUS,1972,102.	The task of building a lasting peace requires the adoption of effective measures to prevent and avert military conflicts in the future. But it is no less important to put an end to the conflicts which are poisoning the international atmosphere now and to put out the military fires in areas where the right of peoples to be masters of their own destinies is being encroached upon. Lack of progress in settling these problems cannot but cause deep anxiety for the future course of world affairs.,UNGD
RUS,1972,"103.	The position of the Soviet Union concerning the war against the Vietnamese people is known to all. The continuation and expansion of the United States intervention in Viet-Nam and other countries of Indochina provoke indignation and condemnation. Probably never before have so many declarations been made containing promises to leave Viet-Nam and to stop the war as have been made recently. And never before has there been such a striking contrast between words and deeds. No matter how much the United States manipulates reports on reductions in the strength of the United States infantry in Viet-Nam in order to appease the public, behind those reports there is in reality an unprecedented expansion of military activities and of their cruelty and inhumanity. No matter how many assurances it gives us that it does not wish to settle the internal affairs of the Viet-Nam people for them, it is in fact pursuing a policy that is aimed at eliminating the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam and the people's armed forces of liberation and at preserving the Saigon puppet administration as the sole legitimate authority in South Viet-Nam.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"104.	One can only wonder why the only correct conclusion has not yet been drawn: namely, that the Vietnamese people cannot be defeated. Their resistance will not be broken either by heavier bombing, the blockading of ports or damage to hydro-technical installations. The Vietnamese people are fighting heroically against aggression and fighting for just aims, in order to be master in their own country. They cannot allow anyone from outside to prescribe a political and social system for them or to impose puppets who uphold interests that are foreign to the Vietnamese people.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"105.	A way out can be found, but only through serious negotiations, for which a constructive basis has been provided by the well-known proposals contained in the statements by the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam of 11 September 1972 and by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam of 14 September 1972.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"106.	The essence of these proposals is clear and simple. The United States of America must respect the right of the Vietnamese people to genuine independence and the right of the people of South Viet-Nam to self-determination. It must stop the war of aggression in Viet-Nam. put an end to the bombing and mining, the blockade and all military activities in Viet-Nam, renounce the policy of the ""Vietnamization"" of the war, immediately withdraw all United States troops from South Viet-Nam and discontinue its military participation and support of the Saigon puppet regime. In the solution of the internal problem of South Viet-Nam, it is essential to work on the basis of the real situation: two authorities, two armies and other political forces exist there. The basis for the solution of the problem lies in the equality of the parties and a rejection of annexation. To that end it is necessary to set up in South Viet-Nam a provisional Government which has been agreed on nationally on a tripartite basis and which will handle all matters during the transitional period and organize general elections on truly free and democratic lines.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"107.	All those who respect the rights of the peoples and all those who have not lost the ability to assess the state of affairs objectively cannot but recognize that these proposals are very well founded, reasonable and logical and that they express the goodwill of the Vietnamese people. They cannot but reject categorically allegations that the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam is trying to impose a ""Communist regime"" on South Viet-Nam.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"108.	If the United States of America wants the negotiations in Paris to lead to the restoration of peace, it should reply positively to the statement by the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam of 11 September 1972. If, however, it is pursuing some other goal, then the talks in Paris can only lead to a deadlock, the war will continue and the full responsibility for it will rest with the United States of America.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"109.	As far as the Soviet Union is concerned, it fully supports the proposals by the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet-Nam. All those who cherish the ideals of freedom and independence cannot fail to have a sense of solidarity with the Vietnamese people in their struggle.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"110.	A solution to the problems of the Middle East must be found. Recent events linked with the new criminal acts of aggression by Israel against Arab countries, including Lebanon, show how serious is the danger and how far the Israeli leaders are going in their reckless policy.",UNGD
RUS,1972,111.	The responsibility which rests with the aggressors is shared by all those who protect them and whose support enables Israel to defy the United Nations and its decisions regarding the elimination of the consequences of the aggression and the restoration of peace in the Middle East. The Israeli leaders must know that an adventurist policy can lead only to apparent success and that in the final analysis it will inevitably entail retribution.,UNGD
RUS,1972,112.	The attempts to appropriate Arab lands and repeated military acts of aggression cannot be tolerated. The United,UNGD
RUS,1972,Nations has the necessary right and the possibilities to put the aggressor in his place.,UNGD
RUS,1972,"113.	Only a long-term and just settlement in the Middle East in accordance with the well-known decisions of the United Nations can ensure the peace and security of all-we repeat, all-States in this region. The Israeli troops must be withdrawn from all the Arab territories occupied in 1967.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"114.	For the Soviet Union, support for the legitimate demands of the Arab countries, for the United Nations decisions regarding a political settlement of the Middle East conflict, and for the mission of Ambassador Jarring is a policy of principle. We are pursuing it and we shall continue to pursue it unswervingly.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"115.	We also support the just struggle of the Arab people of Palestine for the restoration of their inalienable rights, which have been recognized by the United Nations. At the same time, we cannot, of course, condone the acts of terrorism committed by certain elements among the members of the Palestinian movement which have led, among other things, to the recent tragic events in Munich. Their criminal acts also strike a blow at the national interests and aspirations of the Palestinians and are used by the Israeli criminals to cover up their own piratical policy against the Arab peoples.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"116.	On the basis of positions of principle, the Soviet Union opposes acts of terrorism which disrupt the diplomatic activities of States and their representatives, transport communications between them and the normal course of international contacts and meetings, and it opposes acts of violence which serve no positive end and cause loss of human life.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"117.	Peace will not be truly lasting until an end is put to the arms race, which is one of the main sources of distrust among States and of an increased danger of war. The struggle for disarmament has been going on for a long time The Soviet Union and the countries of the socialist community see in the struggle for disarmament one of the main orientations for their foreign policy activities. And this policy will be continued. Some of the things that seemed almost unattainable even 10 or 15 years ago are now reflected in treaties and agreements that have entered into force. These include some which to a certain extent curb the nuclear arms race and reduce the threat of nuclear war: the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373(XXII), annex], the Treaty banning nuclear weapon tests in the three environments, and others. In addition, the first agreement in history on the elimination of a type of armaments which falls within the category of means of mass destruction, namely, bacteriological and toxin weapons, has now been concluded.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"118.	To the sum total of obligations in the field of the limitation of the arms race and disarmament already assumed by the majority of States, one more has recently been added: it concerns those types of armaments which have the greatest destructive force. I am referring to the Soviet-United States strategic arms limitation agreements, signed at Moscow on 26 May 1972. Limiting to the minimum the deployment of anti-ballistic missile systems, the agreements eliminate one of the main motives for unleashing a competition between offensive and defensive missile weapons, the full consequences of which are difficult to predict. By establishing quantitative limits for strategic offensive arms for the first time, the agreements curb the most dangerous trend in the arms race.",UNGD
RUS,1972,119.	The conclusion of the Soviet-United States strategic arms limitation agreements is an important step which will help to reduce the threat of nuclear war and to curb the arms race and which will open up new prospects for progress towards general disarmament. Both sides have agreed to continue the talks with a view to arriving at further agreements in that direction.,UNGD
RUS,1972,"120.	Each successful step in the struggle to limit the arms race is important in its own right and is, at the same time, important as a starting point for further efforts. The possibilities for further progress towards the solution of new disarmament problems will increase with each new step on which agreement is reached. Our country has always desired this and we shall spare no effort in continuing to work, together with all other States, to relieve the peoples of the burden of weapons.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"121.	The Soviet Union favors the earliest possible solution of the question of the halting of the production of chemical weapons and their destruction, concerning which negotiations are being held in the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva. It also favors the halting everywhere and by everyone of nuclear weapon tests, including underground tests, the elimination of foreign military bases on alien territory and the establishment of nuclear-free zones in various parts of the world.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"122.	States have acquired a great deal of experience in negotiations on disarmament. Various methods have been used and are being used; some of them have fully justified themselves and should be used further. At the same time it can hardly be considered proper that, since the advent of the nuclear age, there has not yet been a single occasion on which States have all gathered together to consider the question of disarmament, which affects all States, socialist and capitalist, large and small, developed and developing, nuclear, and non-nuclear. We can therefore only welcome the fact that the idea of convening a world disarmament conference has become one of the most popular ideas among the States of the world and among world public opinion.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"123.	The General Assembly will be considering in a specific manner the question of convening a world disarmament conference [item 26]. Our views on this are well known. We consider that this conference should be a forum at which all countries without exception could present and compare, on an equal basis, their views on the whole range of disarmament questions and come to agreement on practical steps designed to curb the arms race and achieve disarmament. This applies both to weapons of mass destruction and to conventional weapons.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"124.	The Soviet Government believes that full advantage should be taken of the opportunities that are now taking shape for the convening of a world disarmament conference. We, for our part, shall continue to do everything in our power to ensure that it is held and is successful.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"125.	The question of the strengthening of international security is once again on the agenda of the General Assembly [item 35], This problem is an urgent one and will remain so as long as there are forces at work which are interested not in implementing the principles of the United Nations Charter but in aggravating international tension and suppressing the liberation struggle of the peoples.",UNGD
RUS,1972,126.	Great victories have been won by the peoples in their struggle to eliminate colonial oppression. But this problem has not yet been completely solved and millions of people are still living under the colonial and racist yoke.,UNGD
RUS,1972,"127.	The Soviet Union, which was the first country in the history of the world to eradicate national oppression and to ensure genuine prosperity for dozens of nations and nationalities, is irreconcilably opposed to all manifestations of racism, apartheid, colonialism and neocolonialism. Our country opposes all attempts to exert pressure direct or indirect-on States which, after a hard struggle, have won the right to independent development and are now building their national economies, carrying out progressive social and economic reforms and defending their rights to own the natural resources that belong to them. It is the duty of the United Nations to assist those States in every way possible to strengthen their sovereignty and independence.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"128.	In international politics it is necessary constantly to take account of the various questions posed by scientific and technological progress and the requirements which such progress is making on an ever-increasing scale in the field of international co-operation. This applies to economic, scientific and technological links, which are becoming ever richer in content. It applies directly to new areas in which States are active, particularly outer space.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"129.	It was on the basis of those considerations that the Soviet Union submitted proposals on principles governing the activities of States in outer space, on the conclusion of a treaty concerning the moon and on a number of other matters. At the current session of the General Assembly we are proposing that consideration should be given to the item entitled ""Preparation of an international convention on principles governing the use by States of artificial earth satellites for direct television broadcasting"" [item 37]. Our purpose in raising this question is to link inseparably, from the very beginning, the use of this new type of space technology to the noble purposes of strengthening peace and friendship among peoples.",UNGD
RUS,1972,130.	The United Nations must promptly acquire a genuinely universal character. Universality could lend the United Nations new strength and enable it to consider world problems with greater results. We therefore see no justification for attempts to create artificial obstacle to the admission of new States to the United Nations.,UNGD
RUS,1972,"131.	We consider it necessary to ensure the earliest possible admission to the United Nations of the German Democratic Republic, which is fully entitled to be admitted, as is, of course, the Federal Republic of Germany too. This will be in the interests of the further development of co-operation among States and will be in line with the political situation taking shape in Europe.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"132.	No one should cast doubt on the legitimate right to membership in the United Nations of the People's Republic of Bangladesh, which has recently gained its national independence. That State has a legitimate right to become a Member of the United Nations.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"133.	In general, the United Nations should rid itself as quickly as possible of the burden of the past, which is still making itself felt in its activities in various spheres. One such sphere is that of questions relating to Korea. This year there are new possibilities before the General Assembly for a constructive approach to the discussion and solution of these questions. Such possibilities had been afforded by the proposal put forward by the non-aligned and socialist States concerning the ""Creation of favorable conditions to accelerate the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea"" [A/8752 and Add. 1-10]. But those who in the past created a hotbed of tension in the Korean region and are now trying to maintain it have prevented the General Assembly from considering this proposal at the current session. Everyone understands that an artificial delay in this case can only be harmful and that those States which resort to such methods are showing themselves to be opposed to a just settlement in the interests of the normalization of the situation in Korea and the strengthening of peace in that area.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"134.	As to the Soviet Union, our position on the question of Korea has been set out many times. We are in favor of the withdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea and support the measures and efforts of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to achieve the independent and peaceful unification of the country.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"135.	During the period in which the United Nations has existed, attempts have been made on more than one occasion to destroy its Charter. Whatever the subjective intentions of those who are now raising the question of the review of the United Nations Charter, the objective reality is such that this will entail great dangers for all the activities of the United Nations.",UNGD
RUS,1972,136.	The Soviet Union considers that the interests of all States without exception require that attention should be focused not on a revision of the United Nations Charter but on its strict observance and on fuller utilization of the possibilities it affords.,UNGD
RUS,1972,"137.	What is necessary for the United Nations to succeed is the readiness and determination of Member States to act together in the interests of solving the problems facing the Organization. This should make the United Nations a real center for concerted action by nations to achieve common goals, which is an obligation under the United Nations Charter.",UNGD
RUS,1972,138.	Those who seek to divide the United Nations either according to the principle of the size of the territory or,UNGD
RUS,1972,"population of States or by classifying them as ""rich"" and ""poor"" are doing a disservice not only to the United Nations but also to the cause of preserving and strengthening peace as a whole.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"139, That is not what inspired the founders of the United Nations. They wanted the United Nations to be strong and firm in rebuffing aggressors and to be capable of promoting co-operation among all countries irrespective of their size and level of economic development.",UNGD
RUS,1972,"| 140. As to the Soviet Union, it has invariably done and will continue to do everything it can to ensure that the United Nations acts precisely in that manner. The policy of the struggle for peace and security is the general policy of the Soviet Union in the international arena. That policy was adopted half a century ago by. the socialist republics which joined together to form the Soviet Union and it is still the policy today.",UNGD
RUS,1972,141.	The twenty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly is a regular session. But it could become a prominent landmark in the formation of a new system of peaceful relations among States. For this purpose it should focus its attention on the main and most acute political problems brought to the fore by life itself and the whole course of international development.,UNGD
RUS,1973,"1.	 Mr. President, on behalf of the Soviet delegation I should like to congratulate you on your election to the post of President of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. In discharging your duties, you may be assured of our firm intention to help make this session a successful one. The Soviet Union seeks to ensure that every session of the General Assembly yields practical results in strengthening peace and the security of peoples.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"2.	The past year has been crowded with major international events. Some of them, even if viewed separately, represent historic milestones. However, what chiefly characterizes this entire set of events is the development and strengthening of the shift from an extended period of tension in the world to detente and business-like co-operation. From this standpoint, the past year can in a sense be described as having marked a turning-point.",UNGD
RUS,1973,3.	The war in Viet-Nam was brought to an end. The flames of one of the most dangerous breeding grounds of war were stamped out. The just cause of the Viet-Namese people gained a major victory.,UNGD
RUS,1973,"4.	In southern Asia, steps are being taken to bring about a further easing of the tension which several times in the past has led to open hostilities. It is gratifying that all three of the States on the subcontinent-India, Pakistan and Bangladesh-are involved in this process.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"5.	The positive changes in the situation in Europe are even more clearly apparent. The task of normalizing relations between the States of Eastern and Western Europe is virtually complete, and we hope that no one will create artificial obstacles to the completion of this process. The convening of the all-European conference'' marked the opening of a new and extremely important stage in the work of guaranteeing security and organizing peaceful co-operation on a continent-wide scale.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"6.	The danger of a global clash between the two world-wide social systems which would inevitably result in a terrible catastrophe for all mankind has been lessened. That is how the entire world views the Agreement between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America on the Prevention of Nuclear War,  which was concluded during the visit to the United States by L. I. Brezhnev, tire General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"7.	Today, the principle of peaceful coexistence is not only recognized as the only possible basis for relations between the socialist and capitalist countries but is increasingly being given practical effect and embodied in treaties and agreements. The process of detente is a broad and deep one which is involving an increasing number of States and affecting more and more important areas of the relations between them.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"8.	This gives us reason to hope that, as Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev noted in a recent statement, ""the present detente is not a temporary phenomenon but the beginning of a fundamental reorientation of international relations"".",UNGD
RUS,1973,"9.	The changes for the better in international affairs arouse particular satisfaction in the Soviet Union. Not, of course, that other peoples are any less interested in peace than the Soviet Union, It is just that to us the increasing trend towards detente and co-operation is also confirmation of the correctness and consistency of the foreign policy pursued by the Soviet Union.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"10.	Peace and friendship between peoples have always been the watchword of Soviet foreign policy and its unchanging goal. That goal was defined by V. I. Lenin, the founder of the Soviet Socialist State and head of its first Government. It has been and continues to be the basis of the foreign policy guidelines laid down at all Congresses of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Our country has taken this position under all circumstances, regardless of the configuration of the international situation. It must be clear by now to any unprejudiced person that this is the long-range, permanent policy of the Soviet Union and is not merely a response to immediate circumstances. It is determined by the very nature of our social system.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"11.	The shift in the course of international events in the last few years indicates clearly that ensuring a lasting peace on earth is not simply a noble but remote ideal; it is, rather a completely attainable goal of practical politics.",UNGD
RUS,1973,12.	Another fact is no less obvious. The positive results that hive been achieved up to now did not come about of themselves.,UNGD
RUS,1973,"13.	A great deal of intensive effort has gone into the various international measures which led to detente. Sometimes the result is a treaty of agreement drawn up on a page or two of official stationery, but how much labour has gone into every article and paragraph! These agreements are generally preceded by an intensive process of feeling out, by discussions and intensive negotiations. A State visit or international conference lasting no more than a few days crowns the labour of many years.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"14.	Obviously, there is no Government that will not say it wants peace, lasting peace, indeed eternal peace. If such pronouncements are not to remain an idle dream, however, they must be backed up by unremitting efforts that go on day after day.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"15.	The Soviet Union exhorts its allies as well to follow this course. Indeed, we go beyond exhortations; acting in close co-ordination and in the light of international developments, we take concrete initiatives. At the recent Crimean meeting of leaders of the Communist and workers parties of the socialist countries, it was emphasized that all the States concerned must now join efforts in consolidating the favourable changes that have come about in international affairs, must consistently give practical effect to the treaties and agreements that have been concluded and must advance steadily towards the main objective, which is that of ensuring a lasting peace.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"16.	It is a secret .to no one that detente has its enemies whose resistance must not be underestimated. There is also a certain inertia to be overcome. After all, what we are trying to do is to solve problems that have built up over a period of years or even decades.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"17.	However, the supporters of detente are more numerous, and what matters is that their efforts should increase and not slacken.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"18.	In a number of capitalist countries, a trend towards broader co-operation with socialist States has emerged and is becoming increasingly apparent. Far-sighted political figures in those countries, taking a realistic, responsible view of the world situation, show a willingness to join efforts in working out solutions which give equal weight to the interests of all concerned. It goes without saying that this benefits not only the States directly concerned but the entire cause of peace.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"19.	Detente gives the non-aligned and neutral States a greater opportunity to exert a positive influence on international developments, A good many useful ventures, including some within the framework of the United Nations, got their start because of the political influence which these countries exercise. The results of the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries at Algiers showed once again that when the Conference participants speak out in favour of detente and co-operation and against the forces of aggression and oppression of peoples, their voice is convincing and authoritative.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"20.	By its very nature, detente cannot simply be a matter of improving relations between a few States or certain geographical regions. If it is to become irreversible, it must be a matter of concern to all States and ultimately become universal.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"21.	The United Nations has 135 Member States, all of which, when they joined the Organization, assumed an obligation under the Charter to maintain international peace and security. If that entire potential for peace was translated into action, it would indeed give powerful impetus to the advance towards a reliable system of security for all peoples.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"22.	One sometimes hears it said that now that the Soviet Union and the United States are improving their relations and concluding important agreements which help to lessen international tension, there is nothing left for other States to do but to stand by passively. Some go further than that and try to foster the false notion that all of this damages the interests of other countries.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"23.	Apart from the fact that such assertions,, whether intentionally or unintentionally, distort the actual state of affairs, their practical effect can only be to paralyse initiative and hamper detente.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"24.	Is it possible to conceive of a broader sphere in which energies can be brought to bear than that of peace? Peace offers vast scope for all countries. Every State, large or small, bears responsibility for maintaining security throughout the world. The whole question is where its policy leads to — whether it helps detente or hinders it.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"25.	It is important to mark out the political paths to further detente. However, it is no less important that meaningful activities should be undertaken. These efforts cannot remain shut up in government offices. They must be supported by broad, tireless work on behalf of peace by the most varied social forces. Parliamentarians and businessmen, political parties and trade-union, youth, women's and veterans' groups, scientists and artists-all can play a part if there is a determination to work for peace. Millions upon millions of people must be drawn into the movement for a lasting peace.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"26.	Yes, the situation in the world has definitely improved in the past year. It is incomparably better than 5 or 10 years ago. But does that mean that all is bright on the international horizon? No, not by any means.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"27.	In several parts of the world, the danger of war still exists. In some the guns are already speaking, while in others the finger is poised on the trigger.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"28.	The situation in Indo-China is still a complicated one. Military operations are now of a relatively limited nature, but tensions cannot be completely cleared away in that area unless the political settlement if fully implemented in keeping with the legitimate rights and interests of all the peoples of Indo-China.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"29.	The key to this lies in strict compliance by all parties to the Paris agreements on ending the war and restoring peace m Viet Nam. in respect for the agreements reached in Laos, and in permitting the people of Cambodia to settle their internal affairs as they see fit and without foreign interference.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"30.	True to its internationalist convictions, the Soviet Union will continue to give the necessary aid and support of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and to stand beside the patriotic forces in Indo-China.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"31.	Again and again we find ourselves returning to the situation in the Middle East, which, it must be stated bluntly, presents a danger because of the continuing Israeli aggression. Surely we cannot lake comfort in the fact that right now the breeding ground of war is not aflame but merely smouldering. The flames of war may shoot up at any moment, and who can say what the result will be'?",UNGD
RUS,1973,"32.	The aggressor seized foreign lands before the eyes of the entire world and is holding on to them by force. In doing so, he is flagrantly violating the rules of international law. One need only recall the latest acts of provocation against neighbouring Arab countries, which were just recently the object of renewed condemnation by the Security Council. Furthermore, all this is not simply a gesture of recklessness or desperation by a handful of people, but the calculated policy of the State of Israel.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"33.	No Arab can be made to believe that he must reconcile himself to the existing situation. The Arab States, which have been the victims of imperialist aggression, want only one thing - the restoration of what was taken from them by force -and they are right.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"34.	The Soviet Union remains convinced that the Middle East problem can be solved. The basis for a solution exists in the form of the well-known Security Council resolutions, which as was confirmed once again by the recent discussion of the Middle East question in the United Nations are supported by an overwhelming majority of Stales Members of our Organization. The aggressor is becoming increasingly defiant in his refusal to agree to a settlement.",UNGD
RUS,1973,35.	Every effort must be made to see that Israel and the countries and circles that support its present policy understand at long last the need for a more sober approach and that they truly *et out on the path leading to a solution of the problem.,UNGD
RUS,1973,"36.	As far as the Soviet Union is concerned, its position is clear, the situation in the Middle East must be resolved un the basis of the complete I repeat, complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from occupied Arab territories and of respect for the independence and inalienable rights of the States and peoples of the area, including the Arab people of Palestine. Our main, decisive interest in the Middle Fast is to promote the achievement of a just and lasting peace. The Soviet Union wishes to state tins once again from tins rostrum in the most categorical terms.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"37.	In order to obtain a proper perspective in a situation characterized by the extreme complexity of the interplay of various factors, one must appraise events in all their fullness and constant flux. That is particularly true at the present stage of the situation, which is dynamic and full of contrasts.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"38.	If one views unsolved problems without reference to the positive results that have already been achieved, it is easy to take an extreme position and deny the very possibility of resolving acute, controversial issues. In our opinion, however, there is no place for this approach to international phenomena, including the activities of the United Nations.",UNGD
RUS,1973,39.	Equally unproductive is the other extreme that of presenting the situation in rosy hues and failing to see that what remains to be done is far more than what has already been accomplished.,UNGD
RUS,1973,"40.	Both extremes are bad. All States, all Governments and all political figures must, if they are conscious of their responsibility, regard it as their first duty in (he international arena to work actively for peace.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"41.	A whole series of problems are clamouring for solution. It cannot be said that the United Nations is not dealing with them. It may well be asked, however, how many of them are really being solved, and the answer is not a comforting one. It must be acknowledged that some problems become harder rather than easier to solve as time goes by, but they may become even more difficult if they are put off further.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"42.	The problem of problems is that of the continuing arms race. The development of techniques of mass destruction and the stockpiling of weapons have long since gone beyond the point where using them becomes an absurdity, for, as V. I. Lenin foresaw half a century ago, this process is ""undermining the very conditions for the existence of human society"". It must be obvious to all how ruinous it is to go on replenishing the arsenals. Yet. only in recent years has it become possible to take the first I repeat, the first step towards limiting the arms race.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"43.	It would be wrong to underestimate the importance of the measures that have already been taken. These measures serve to impede to some extent the unrestrained proliferation of armaments, particularly the most destructive types.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"44.	Ten years have passed since the signing of the Moscow Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under Water, which was the first in a series of agreements. The fact that some countries have not acceded to the Treaty does not nullify the indisputable fact that it is beneficial to the peoples of the world.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"45.	The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  has gained wide recognition, and it has also been extremely helpful in curbing the unclear arms race.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"46.	Success has been achieved in preventing of the emplacement of nuclear weapons in several important natural environments, namely the sea-bed and the ocean floor and outer space. Bacteriological weapons which are among the most deadly, have been banned and eliminated.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"47.	 Just recently, an important frontier was crossed when, as a result of agreements reached between the Soviet Union and the United States, mutual limitations were imposed on strategic arms and principles were formulated for negotiations on further such limitations. In conjunction with the historic conclusion of the Agreement between the Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America on the Prevention of Nuclear War, these accords contribute significantly to an improvement in the international atmosphere.",UNGD
RUS,1973,,UNGD
RUS,1973,"48.	However, further efforts are needed, and they cannot, of course, be confined to two nuclear Powers, even though those two may be militarily the mightiest in the world. We could, in particular, find it gratifying if other States were willing to adhere to the principles jointly laid down by the Soviet Union and the United States for renunciation of the use of force and decisive action to prevent the outbreak of nuclear war; that would be of exceptional importance in ensuring lasting peace throughout the world.",UNGD
RUS,1973,,UNGD
RUS,1973,"120.	Huge sums continue to be spent for military purposes, and military planning goes on.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"121.	Since the United Nations first began to function, the Soviet Union has consistently sought to turn events in the direction of disarmament. We have always urged that it is of the utmost importance to ban nuclear weapons and ensure that nuclear energy is used exclusively for peaceful purposes. I might recall that back in 1946, the first year of our Organization's existence, the Soviet Union placed on the negotiating table a draft international convention to prohibit the production and employment of weapons based on the use of atomic energy for the purpose of mass destruction; it did so in the belief that the aspirations and the conscience of nations called for such a convention.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"122.	How much discussion there has been since that time, and how many resolutions have been adopted by the Security Council, the General Assembly and various committees and commissions! If this were not such a serious matter, one could speak sarcastically about the mountains of paper that have been used up in the process. The essential point, however, is that there has been little change in the situation.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"123.	It would not occur to anyone to deny that the solution of the problems of disarmament involves great difficulties. And yet the international questions which have been successfully resolved up to now also appeared forbidding at the outset. Consequently, references to objective difficulties do not reveal the main point. The crux of the matter lies in political considerations. And responsibility for political considerations rests primarily with the people who are invested with power, those who stand at the helm of government.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"124.	There is hardly any point in digging about in the past, in analysing all the proposals which have been made or in dwelling on the positions of individual States. All that is quite well known. The walls of the United Nations have heard many speeches on the subject of disarmament.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"125.	Today, however, we all have more experience in settling international problems than we had yesterday. And it suggests to us that even in the field of disarmament real progress can be achieved in some areas. All that is needed is to follow in practice a truth which in theory is certainly recognized by all: not to proclaim ""all or nothing"", but to single out one after another those problems on which agreement can be reached even at the present stage, and then solve them. Experience has shown that this approach can prove its worth even in such matters as vital to the security of the State as that ultimate weapon, the nuclear missile. Is that not demonstrated by the Soviet-American agreements dealing with that matter?",UNGD
RUS,1973,"126.	Neither can there be any doubt about another matter. Those agreements would not have been possible if they had put either side at a disadvantage, if the principle of equal security had not been scrupulously observed.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"127.	But if, on such a basis, two countries have been able to achieve a limitation of arms, then why cannot, say, five Powers act similarly, provided, of course, that there will be no threat to the security of any of them? And if that can be done, what is there to prevent such a method from being applied to a wider range of countries? The greater the number of States that participate in a practical solution of the disarmament problem, the more tangible will be the benefit for the security of all peoples.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"128.	Furthermore, we believe that the successes achieved on the path towards detente already make it possible for considerable additional resources to be made available to assist the developing countries.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"129.	In view of all these considerations, the Soviet Union wishes to propose that the question of the reduction of the military budgets of States permanent members of the Security Council of the United Nations by 10 per cent and utilization of part of the funds thus saved to provide assistance to developing countries should be included in the agenda of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations as an important and urgent item.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"130.	If our proposal meets with general agreement, and if the General Assembly adopts an appropriate resolution, a beneficial and useful step can be taken.",UNGD
RUS,1973,131.	The States which are permanent members of the Security Council of the United Nations are known to have the largest military budgets. This is taken into account in our proposal.,UNGD
RUS,1973,"132.	In our view it would be appropriate to take as the starting-point for the proposed reduction the level of military budgets for the current year, 1973. That proportion of the funds made available by such a reduction which would be used to benefit the developing countries could, for example, amount to 10 per cent.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"133.	Needless to say, such a step would require ""the participation of all the permanent members of the Security",UNGD
RUS,1973,Council without exception. It would also be desirable for other economically and militarily powerful States to reduce their military budgets.,UNGD
RUS,1973,"134.	We suggest that the funds made available for economic assistance to the developing countries should, first of all, be granted to those countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America which have experienced great difficulties this year because of grave natural disasters such as drought and floods.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"135.	The distribution of these funds should be carried out on an equitable basis. The amounts to be granted to individual countries, and the time-limits within which they are to be provided, could be determined by an international committee appointed on an ad hoc basis from among representatives of the developing countries, the States which are permanent members of the Security Council and other countries which reduce their military budgets.",UNGD
RUS,1973,136.	It is obvious that the reductions in military expenditure would also benefit the States carrying out such reductions. They would be able to channel considerable funds towards the non-military needs of their own people and an improved standard of living.,UNGD
RUS,1973,137.	The United Nations has laid the groundwork for fruitful activities on behalf of peace in a number of important fields.,UNGD
RUS,1973,"138.	Specifically, at last year's session, the General Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of the settlement of two major problems: the non-use of force in international relations and permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons [resolution 2936 (XXVIII], and the question of a World Disarmament Conference [resolution 2930 (XXVII].",UNGD
RUS,1973,"139.	But has this clearly expressed will of the peoples of the world, this opinion of the overwhelming majority of the States Members of the United Nations been taken into account by all States? Unfortunately, that cannot be said to be true. It is a known fact that the Governments of some States have taken a position which prevents those decisions from being put into effect.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"140.	The Soviet Union believes that the earliest possible implementation of the solemn declaration of the General Assembly, speaking on behalf of the members of the United Nations, concerning their renunciation of the use of force in international relations and the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons, would be an effective means of ensuring that one of the principles of the United Nations Charter was laid down as a law of international life. To that end, a forceful decision in the matter must be taken by the Security Council.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"43. For its part, the Soviet Union is ready to negotiate and to formalize reciprocal undertakings with all -and I stress, all — the nuclear powers on the non-use of force, including, at the same time, prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons.",UNGD
RUS,1973,44. The time has come to undertake practical preparations for the convening of a World Disarmament Conference. Arrangements must finally be made so that the Special Committee provided for in the General Assembly resolution relating to preparations for that Conference can carry out the functions entrusted to it. There is no need to prove how desirable it is for all the nuclear Powers to take part in the Committee's work.,UNGD
RUS,1973,"145.	There are some who contend that the World Disarmament Conference could not be productive because of the large number of participants. But who ever said that complex problems must necessarily be settled by two or three States, or that a large-scale international conference will not reach agreement?",UNGD
RUS,1973,"146.	We harbour no illusions that the World Disarmament Conference will do away with all problems at one stroke. Let it go on for several months, or even several years. How can there be any objection to that if the Conference makes a contribution to the practical solution of urgent disarmament problems?",UNGD
RUS,1973,"147.	It is also argued that the Conference might hamper the efforts at solutions involving a smaller number of States. We feel that such fears are unfounded. Multilateral efforts can only help bilateral ones, and vice versa.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"148.	Although detente and the development of peaceful co-operation are measured, not in decades, but merely in years, into this short period of time there have been compressed events which are significantly changing the face of the world.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"149.	Memories are still fresh of a time when relations between the Soviet Union and the major capitalist countries were marked by tension and, in the case of some of them, by outright hostility. The fact that those times are now behind us is not welcomed by all. But all who are concerned for peace welcome the fact that those relations are now on a new track.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"150.	The Soviet Union and France have been dealing with each other in a consistent and serious manner for a number of years. Both countries have acquired useful experience and are using the favourable trends of detente to develop both their bilateral ties and political co-operation in international matters, and especially European matters. The Soviet Union values that important achievement.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"151.	The radical changes achieved by the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany in their relations demonstrate that the two States are guided not by considerations of expediency, but by the long-term interests of their peoples and the interests of peace in Europe. A spirit of realism has also prevailed in the approach of the Federal Republic of Germany to questions which had long divided it and the Polish People's Republic and the German Democratic Republic. Many obstacles to the establishment of normal relations between the Federal Republic of Germany and the other socialist countries of Europe have been removed, although in the Federal Republic of Germany itself, from all indications, such a policy is not to everyone's liking. The influence of forces clinging to old, outworn policies can still be felt there even today.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"152. A few days ago the General Assembly congratulated the representatives of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, two independent sovereign States, on their countries' admission to membership in the United Nations. This is one of the most important indications of the changes which are taking place in the world. We warmly welcome the presence in this hall of the delegation of the fraternal German Democratic Republic, and we are also gratified to see here the delegation of the Federal Republic of Germany.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"153.	It is not difficult to gauge the significance of the historic fact that the General Assembly of the United Nations, pursuant to Security Council recommendations, enthusiastically adopted the decision to admit these two States to membership in the United Nations. That fact shows merely that such a decision was long overdue. It is in keeping not only with the interests of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, but also the interests of all States throughout the world.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"154.	In a mere 18 months or two years an enormous distance has been covered in relations between the Soviet Union and the United States of America. As a result of Soviet-American talks at the highest level — during the visit of President R. Nixon to Moscow in May of last year and the visit of the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet union, Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev, to the United States this year — a firm basis has been laid for the development of relations between the two countries in a way which is fully in keeping with the principle of peaceful coexistence and which opens up vast possibilities. A number of agreements in various fields have been concluded. All these agreements have been made public; they speak for themselves. And they have not remained mere pieces of paper; much work has been done to give them concrete expression.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"155.	It is of fundamental importance that the improvement in Soviet-American relations is being achieved on the basis of mutual recognition of the opposition between the two States' social systems and ideologies, and on the understanding that the rapprochement between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America is directed against no one and threatens no one's interests.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"156.	The Soviet Union is convinced that if both sides unswervingly carry out all the obligations they have assumed, including the strict observance of a cardinal principle in international relations, that of non-interference in each other's internal affairs — a principle on which our whole approach is based-then Soviet-American relations will be a permanent favourable factor promoting international peace-a point which is of historic significance.",UNGD
RUS,1973,157.	Relations between the Soviet Union and Japan are not at a standstill. The Soviet Union intends to continue to work to ensure that these relations become relations of genuine good-neighbourliness and co-operation. That is quite feasible if both countries constantly bear in mind the fundamental long-term interests of peace and security in the Far East.,UNGD
RUS,1973,158.	The Soviet Union is ready to expand its relations of mutually advantageous co-operation with all countries of,UNGD
RUS,1973,"Europe and the other continents which so desire, whether in the search for solutions to current international political problems, wide-ranging economic agreements, joint efforts to use the benefits of scientific and technological progress or the exchange of spiritual values.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"159.	On the first day of the present session of the General Assembly the second phase of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe began. This is a great and unprecedented endeavour. For the first time all European States, together with the United States and Canada have sat down at the same table in order jointly to determine measures that would help to assure the peoples of Europe a peaceful future for as long as can be foreseen.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"160.	The Soviet Union views the prospects for the work of the Conference with considerable optimism. Its participants have already to a certain extent found a common language; there are, at least, no differences between them in agreeing that the Conference faces tasks of great importance which will require business-like and constructive consideration. If such an approach prevails to the end, the participants in the Conference will be able to place their contribution to the strengthening of general peace in the scales of history with a sense of satisfaction. That will benefit not only States directly concerned with European affairs, but all peoples of the world.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"161.	There is a possibility of achieving a good and, in terms of its potential consequences, even a historic success as a result of the Conference. All that is necessary for this is for all participants to display a responsible and serious approach to the problems before them. Nobody should yield to the temptation to teach others how to manage their internal affairs. It must be admitted that some would like to try to impose their own internal practices on others. No, internal practices, internal laws, represent the line before the threshold of every State at which all others must stop.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"162.	Were we to embark on a course of imposing our own practices on other countries, whether in the field of economic life or ideology, it is probable that those who are trying to persuade us to adopt the laws .morals and customs of others would disagree. And that is understandable and justified. If States and their representatives to the United Nations tried to act in that way, none of us here would advance one step in important matters and people would, not without justification, draw an analogy between the activity of the United Nations and the Biblical legend of the Tower of Babel, where those involved ceased to understand one another and failed to complete what they had intended to build.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"163.	Meanwhile, some in the West are not averse to launching noisy propaganda campaigns and even to resorting to the methods of blackmail in order to cover up their own attempts to interfere in the affairs of other countries. Matters have gone so far that they are attempting to arrogate to themselves the right to dictate right and left by whom and how the question of emigration from this or that country should be handled, how many emigrants there should be and when and just where they should go. In doing so, they do not hesitate to praise to the skies those who represent no one but who, whether deliberately or inadvertently, are merely an unwitting weapon in the hands of the forces opposed to the relaxation of tension in the world.",UNGD
RUS,1973,164.	The Soviet Union decisively rejects such an approach and condemns it. We will not allow anyone to interfere in our internal affairs.,UNGD
RUS,1973,"165.	The question that inevitably comes to mind is this: do the organizers of these campaigns seriously think that only the Soviet Union, only the socialist countries are interested in international detente and in the development of trade, scientific and technical and other forms of co-operation and that others are merely doing them a great favour by agreeing to hold talks on these matters?",UNGD
RUS,1973,"166.	Anyone who is interested in the slightest degree in seeing an improvement in the international situation is well aware that this is not the case, that this is a reciprocal process governed by the mutual interests of the parties concerned and, above all, by the interests of the people.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"167.	The main thing now is not to let the basic, truly important problems facing States be overshadowed by a poisonous atmosphere deliberately cheated over trumped-up questions.",UNGD
RUS,1973,168.	The Soviet Union considers it desirable to supplement political detente in Europe by military detente. This cause may be served by yet another major undertaking by a number of States: the talks opening on 20 October 1973 on the mutual reduction of armed forces and armaments in central Europe.,UNGD
RUS,1973,"169.	As a result of the positive changes in the international situation, it is also becoming possible to view the situation in Asia in a new light.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"170.	In Asian affairs, as in international affairs in general, the policy of the Soviet Union is a policy directed towards peace, security and co-operation. The Soviet Union extends its hand to any State which shares these goals. A shining example of this is the uninterrupted development of relations between the USSR and India, a great, peace-loving Asian Power. It is further demonstrated by the history of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and many other Asian countries. Our fundamental belief is that there are no problems in relations between the Soviet Union and the States of Asia which could not be solved at the negotiating table.",UNGD
RUS,1973,171.	The Soviet Union is the initiator of the concept of collective security in Asia. This idea is constantly gaining strength; scepticism is being dispelled and the unfounded suspicions are disappearing.,UNGD
RUS,1973,"172.	In a recent speech in Alma Ata, the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, L. I. Brezhnev, said that we support collective security in Asia because ""we are seeking to eliminate war, armed conflicts and imperialist aggression on the continent of Asia; we want the conditions for unhampered development and national revival to be guaranteed every country and people; we want a spirit of trust and",UNGD
RUS,1973,"mutual understanding to prevail in relations between the countries of Asia"".",UNGD
RUS,1973,"173.	The Soviet Union is in favour of equitable participation in the system of collective security by all Asian countries, without any exception. Any intention of directing collective security in Asia against any State is totally alien to us, despite allegations to the contrary.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"174.	The positive changes which have recently become apparent on the Asian continent also include the emergence of new, constructive factors in the situation on the Korean peninsula and this is, first and foremost, to the credit of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. That being so, it would be all the more inadmissible for new, artificial obstacles to the peaceful and democratic unification of Korea to be added to the old forms of outside interference in the internal affairs of the Korean people.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"175.	There is, of course, no need to recall in detail in this Assembly the consistent support which the Soviet Union has given and continues to give to the developing States of Asia, Africa and Latin America. On more than one occasion the United Nations has been the arena for fierce political battles with colonialism of every kind, and the Soviet Union has always resolutely defended oppressed peoples and given all possible support to their struggle for national liberation.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"176.	We are well aware that this is a difficult and grim struggle, and some very recent events remind us yet again that it may take tragic turns.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"177.	In Chile, as we know, the lawful Government has been overthrown. The elected President, Salvador Allende, his country's most outstanding patriot, has been killed. The forces of reaction have struck a blow at the Chilean people's desire for true independence and freedom.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"178.	There was serious provocation of another Latin American State, Cuba, whose embassy and one of whose ships were fired upon. Surely the heads of the military junta realize that such acts can only be described as international brigandage and acts of aggression?",UNGD
RUS,1973,179.	An anti-Soviet campaign has been stirred up in the country; there are instances of arbitrary and violent action against Soviet institutions and citizens who were sent to give friendly assistance to the Chilean people at the request of the lawful Government of the country.,UNGD
RUS,1973,180.	What can one say about this? There can be no doubt that history will bring to account those who attempt to prevent the peoples from breathing the air of genuine independence or to drown in blood their right to national freedom.,UNGD
RUS,1973,"181.	For its part, the Soviet Government could not remain indifferent to the intolerable situation that was developing and took the decision to break off diplomatic relations with Chile, or, more precisely, with the regime of the military junta.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"182.	There is no doubt that the just cause of the Chilean people will triumph in the end, despite the current tragedy.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"183.	States which have embarked on the course of political independence have always found and will continue to find in the Soviet Union a friend ready to aid them in consolidating their economic self-sufficiency, to share its knowledge and experience and to assist them in their moments of difficulty. Expansion of co-operation with developing countries is an integral part of the foreign policy of the Soviet Union.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"184.	It is our conviction that the relaxation of international tension is conducive to a situation where young States can, in peace, devote all their efforts and resources to economic and social progress, to raising the living standards of their people, and to shaping their own future without fear of outside interference.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"185.	The healthier the over-all world atmosphere becomes, the more anachronistic are the remaining vestiges of colonialism and the reserves of apartheid and racial discrimination, the stronger is the condemnation they merit and the more vigorous must be the struggle to bring about their complete elimination. It is the clear duty of the United Nations to contribute to the speediest possible elimination of these shameful survivals of colonialism wherever they still exist, be it in Angola or Mozambique, Bissau or Southern Rhodesia, South or South-West Africa.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"186.	It is our aim that the voice of the fighters should be clearly heard here, within the walls of the United Nations, that the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples adopted by the fifteenth session of the United Nations General Assembly [resolution 1514 (XV)] should be fully implemented and that the racists and colonialists should be finally deprived of the opportunity to receive support from outside, in particular from certain Member countries of the United Nations, something which is still a feature of current international life.",UNGD
RUS,1973,187.	Those who struggle against colonialism and racism for their national liberation and for their inalienable human rights and dignity enjoy the unwavering support of the Soviet Union. Let there be no doubt that the Soviet Union will continue to do its utmost to ensure that this struggle ends in a decisive victory.,UNGD
RUS,1973,"188.	In the struggle for peace, the Soviet Union and the countries of the socialist community are one with the developing States and we value this highly. With some of these countries we have well established relations; with others, relations are only now beginning to develop. But apart from this, the platform of the struggle for further detente offers ever-greater opportunities for co-operation. We believe that the fullest possible advantage should be taken of them.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"189.	Throughout its history, the United Nations has operated in varying political weather, and so far the fine days have been far fewer than the bad ones. What has enabled it not merely to survive but also to do many useful things? The fact that it was founded for the purpose of maintaining international peace. And this task remains permanently relevant. From another point of view, the United Nations Charter contains adequate provisions for the fulfilment of the Organization's lofty mission. The",UNGD
RUS,1973,"United Nations has demonstrated its strength in those cases where the purposes and principles of its Charter have been strictly observed, and its weakness when departures from the Charter have been permitted. What matters is that this world Organization should remain in the mainstream of international politics, contributing to the solution of crucial problems.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"190.	This does not in any way imply that the Soviet Union is inclined to neglect even one aspect of the diversified activities of the United Nations, whether of an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian nature. It actively assists in putting into practice everything of value-1 repeat, everything of value — that the collective wisdom and experience of States can produce.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"191.	Indeed, a few days ago, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR ratified two important international legal instruments pertaining to respect for fundamental human rights and freedoms and the protection of human dignity and the interests of society as a whole. These documents were carefully and thoroughly elaborated in United Nations bodies and were subsequently approved by the General Assembly. I am referring to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights [resolution 2200 A (XXI), annex] and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights [ibid.]. These two Covenants do not merely contain wishes or recommendations of a declaratory nature, but provide for quite specific obligations on the part of States parties to them. We appeal to countries which have not yet signed or ratified these Covenants to follow our example and to take steps to ensure that they come into force as soon as possible.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"192.	The peoples of the world expect from the United Nations measures which will contribute to a further improvement in the international situation. With favourable changes taking place in the world, opportunities are increasing for the United Nations to make its own, major contribution to the consolidation of detente and to making it stable and irreversible.",UNGD
RUS,1973,"193.	For its part, the Soviet Union is sparing no effort for the triumph of the cause of peace on earth. This is the essence of its peace-loving policy and its peace programme, launched by the Twenty-fourth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Every State, every statesman can be confident that he will continue to find in the Soviet Union a faithful partner at all times and in all cases where action is taken to prevent the danger of war and contribute to peace.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"Mr. President, on behalf of the Soviet delegation, I should like to congratulate you upon your election to the important post of President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. I should like to wish you success in the fulfillment of this important task. The unanimity with which you were elected once again demonstrates the respect which is enjoyed internationally by your country, the Algerian People's Democratic Republic.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"120.	No session of the General Assembly is the same as the previous one, nor is the world situation against the background of which they convene the same. This is particularly noticeable against the swiftly changing background of events in recent years. What does remain unchanged, however, is the criterion that the United Nations and each of its Members must be guided by at all times and in all things -namely, concern for the maintenance of international peace and security. It is against this fundamental criterion that the activities of the United Nations and the practical actions of States in the international arena should be measured.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"121.	With regard to the Soviet Union, we throw onto the scales of peace the entire influence of our State, the whole authority of our policy. This has always been the case and it will continue to be. Those who are earnestly seeking for ways to establish and consolidate peaceful relations and to settle disputed problems around the negotiating table can definitely count on the reliable co-operation of the Soviet Union.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"122.	For more than half a century our country has consistently pursued a policy of peace, a policy of rebuffing aggression and safeguarding the rights of peoples, as that policy was formulated by Vladimir ilyich Lenin. In present-day conditions too the struggle for peace means for us not just an abstract category but a matter of concrete efforts to give practical effect to the foreign policy guidelines laid down by the Twenty-Fourth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. It is the expression of the Soviet people's will for peace and uncompromising determination to make it stronger.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"123.	Implementation of the Congress's decisions the program of Peace and Co-operation has already yielded tangible results in the improvement of the international situation. This is clear to any impartial observer. It is equally clear that the current positive changes are to everyone's benefit. Indeed, if there is an area where the fundamental interests of all nations, without exception, do converge, that is the maintenance of peace.",UNGD
RUS,1974,124.	The Soviet Union pursues its policies in close co-ordination with its allies and friends. The socialist community of States unites its participants in a common creative effort the building of an advanced society which by its very nature rejects war. It is no accident that many major peace initiatives have been sponsored by the socialist countries. The session of the Political Consultative Committee of the States Parties to the Warsaw Treaty last April reaffirmed their joint determination to fight for the triumph of the ideals of peace and the economic and social progress of the peoples.,UNGD
RUS,1974,"125.	The general state of world affairs is being molded by a tremendous number of factors, ranging from political and military to national or even psychological factors. And it therefore hardly lends itself to one-dimensional assessment. But the main trend of international development arouses no doubts: it is detente and the desire for detente which are today the predominant features.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"126.	For the first time, international detente has gone beyond good wishes and verbal assurances. It is a term that has now found a place for itself in the political vocabulary precisely because it is backed by some very real content the positive changes in reality itself. From the vantage point of recent years one can distinctly see how much has been done in this respect.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"127.	Through joint efforts by many States it has become possible to reduce the risk of armed conflict between the two social systems. But of special significance are the well-known agreements of 1972-1974 between the Soviet Union and the United States of America. This applies above all to the Agreement on the Prevention of Nuclear War. The two major Powers undertook to make efforts to preclude entirely the risk of military conflict, including that involving nuclear weapons, between the Soviet Union and the United States, or between either of the parties and other States. At the same time, they agreed to refrain from the use of force against each other and against other countries in circumstances which may endanger international peace and security.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"128.	Not long ago there was bitter fighting in IndoChina, in the Middle East, and in South Asia. And these were not the only areas where events took a dangerous turn. Now several international conflicts have, to a certain extent, been channeled in the direction of political settlement.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"129.	It is well known that on more than one occasion tensions in Europe have risen to an alarming level. There were no military clashes, but if the total damage inflicted by the ""cold war"" and its tensions is estimated, it will prove enormous from all standpoints. Nowadays the political development of the European continent is ever more steadily taking a different course. Not only have acute problems of the territorial and political arrangements arising out of the Second World War been solved there, but also prospects for a safer, peaceful future for Europe have been opened up.",UNGD
RUS,1974,130.	Alongside this there is another major asset of detente— the development of bilateral relations between States with different social systems. In the past too there were periods when it was impossible to organize business-like co-operation between them. But the experience of decades has shown us that that was rather the exception than the rule. Now peaceful co-existence is increasingly becoming the law of contemporary life. And the very nature of these relations is changing in many ways as they become steeped in the spirit of peaceful co-operation.,UNGD
RUS,1974,"131.	Finally, it was precisely detente that put on the agenda the question of restructuring economic relations in the world. The point of this was to eliminate inequality arid discrimination, and to ensure in practice the sovereign right of States to dispose of their natural resources. The sixth special session of the General Assembly called severely to task those who for centuries have been exploiting the labor and resources of others, and indicated ways of eliminating economic oppression. The Soviet Union supports the just demands of the developing countries.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"132.	On the whole, it can be stated with confidence that international events are now taking a course closer to peace. However, one should also see one other thing clearly: the movement towards peace does not always follow a straight line, and difficulties along this road will not necessarily decrease with each passing year. In a certain sense the problems which have to be dealt with today are not simpler but perhaps even more complicated than those of yesterday. And there is more to it than just objective causes.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"133.	In the final analysis, the solution of the accumulated problems is hampered by the deliberate opposition of those forces whose interests are associated with policies contrary to the policy of detente. A closer look will reveal behind each instance of aggravation whether caused by encroachments on the freedom and independence of nations, by the stepping-up of the arms race, or by attempts to test the durability of existing international treaties the overt or covert activities of those forces. And when at times you hear people say that detente is a purely temporary phenomenon or allege that it has exhausted itself, you can recognize without fail from what quarter these statements come.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"134.	The Soviet Union counters them with its own motto, which is not to slacken efforts to ensure that the healthy processes which have now been embarked upon should become irreversible and consolidated. As the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Leonid I. Brezhnev, stressed recently, ""If you want peace, pursue a policy of peace and struggle for that policy"". We are convinced that in our time the complete elimination of the threat of war is feasible albeit not close at hand provided active and persistent efforts are made to that end.",UNGD
RUS,1974,135.	The fact that the world is still far from what the peoples would like it to be is demonstrated by the tragedy which has afflicted the Republic of Cyprus. Some may have the impression that this is an event of local significance. The Soviet Union takes a different view.,UNGD
RUS,1974,"136.	Before the eyes of the world the force of arms is being used ruthlessly to trample on the independence and territorial integrity of a sovereign Member State of the United Nations, a participant in the non-aligned movement. The fact that this is a small country presents developments in a special light. Another hotbed of tension has appeared in the eastern Mediterranean, and unless urgent measures are taken no one can guarantee that the situation will not deteriorate even further.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"137.	From the very beginning the Soviet Union came out in defense of the inalienable rights of the State of Cyprus. It has been resolutely calling for an end to outside interference in the affairs of Cyprus, for the withdrawal of foreign troops from its soil, for the restoration of constitutional order, and for the Cypriots to be given a chance to decide their destiny for themselves. That is the only way radically to remove the tension. The demand that , the Charter of the United Nations be observed should not be an empty phrase as those responsible for events in Cyprus would like to see it. It must be complied with in the case of the Cyprus tragedy too.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"138.	The Cyprus problem must be brought out of the impasse resulting from attempts of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] to solve it in camera, in political darkness, and in the narrow interests of militarist circles. This purpose that is, a just solution to the Cyprus problem is promoted by the Soviet Union's proposal to convene an international conference on Cyprus within the framework of the United Nations.7 The decisions of such a conference, adopted with the direct participation of representatives of the Republic of Cyprus and aimed at ensuring the country's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, could be effectively guaranteed by the States permanent members of the Security Council, for, under the Charter of the United Nations, it is precisely they who are entrusted with special responsibility for maintaining international peace and security.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"139.	IndoChina is situated on the other side of the planet, and the situation there is different. But the underlying reasons why the guns are still firing and blood is still flowing in some parts of the region are the same as in Cyprus. It is all due to the stubborn reluctance of foreign-backed reactionary forces to respect the legitimate rights of the peoples.",UNGD

To bring to a conclusion the political settlement in Viet Nam it is necessary, in the first place, to make the Saigon regime give up its military provocations and attempts to undermine the Paris agreements on Viet Nam. Strict observance of these agreements by all parties is an indispensable condition for the normalization of the situation. As for Cambodia, its problems must be solved by the Cambodians themselves, in accordance with their national interests and without any outside interference. The positive results of agreements reached in Laos should also be consolidated.",UNGD
RUS,1974,141.	The comprehensive assistance and support given by the Soviet Union and other States of the Socialist community to the Vietnamese people have helped them to achieve victory in the long and heroic struggle against aggression. The Soviet Union will continue to support the Vietnamese people in peacetime too. The aspirations of the patriotic forces of IndoChina to freedom and independence will always be met with our understanding and solidarity. ,UNGD
RUS,1974,"142.	For almost 30 years now the Middle East has been in a state of fever. Over this period wars have broken out there time and time again. In fact, the last one was only a year ago. This should be enough to convince anyone that the Middle East problem must be solved and solved justly, with the interests of all the peoples of the region being taken into account.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"143.	What does that imply? First of all, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all—I stress, from all the Arab lands seized by them in 1967 and the assurance of the legitimate national rights of the Arab people of Palestine. Otherwise there can be no stable peace in the Middle East. It does not need a prophet to foresee a new flare-up of hostilities if the Middle East settlement is reduced to half-measures, no matter how-well advertised they may be.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"144.	There are increasing signs that Israel regards the disengagement of forces on Sinai and the Golan Heights not as the first step towards a general settlement which is what it should be but as a maneuver intended to freeze the situation. The clear unwillingness to leave the occupied Arab territories and, moreover, a desire to consolidate Israel's hold on them are quite evident. What other explanation can there be for the militarist intoxication which has again overcome Israel and for the attempts to exert military pressure on the Arab States? Unless this stops, the disengagement of troops may prove to be a mere regrouping of forces prior to a new clash.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"145.	The Soviet Union believes that there must be no delay in implementing measures leading to a political settlement in the Middle East, and this means prompt resumption of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East, the most appropriate forum for considering the Middle East problem in all its complex totality and for finding solutions satisfactory to the parties involved in the conflict. Naturally, this fully applies also to the Arab people of Palestine, whose representatives must take their rightful place at the conference.	;",UNGD
RUS,1974,"146.	We believe that the time has surely come to address ourselves earnestly to the problem of Palestine. A wider approach is required here, which would open the way to ensuring not only in words but in deeds the legitimate national rights of the Arab people of Palestine, and that is why we favoured including the question of Palestine on the agenda of this session of the General Assembly as a separate item.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"147.	There are some who try to represent the Soviet Union's position as one-sided and only serving the interests of the Arab States. Yes, indeed, we do support and will continue to support the legitimate demands of the Arabs. But it would be wrong to see only this particular aspect in our position. When we insist that territories acquired by force should not become a prize for aggression, the implications of our demand go well beyond the limits of the Middle East. It reflects intolerance of aggression in general. What this involves, therefore, is a major international principle and the question of consistency in policy.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"148.	Furthermore, the Soviet Union is in favor of Israel's existence and development as an independent sovereign State. We have said so many times",UNGD
RUS,1974,in,UNGD
RUS,1974,"and we affirm it once again. Real, not illusory, progress towards a Middle East settlement will create prerequisites for the development of relations between the Soviet Union and all the States of the Middle East, including Israel.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"149.	The scope of the policy of peace and detente is broad. It is important not to lose momentum in any field and, above all, wherever serious work has already begun to build more stable relations between States on the basis of the observance of the principles of peaceful coexistence.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"150.	In this context, the Soviet Union attaches primary importance to the successful conclusion of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. This is question number one in European political life today. An objective assessment of what has already been done at the Conference prompts the conclusion that, on the whole, the results are impressive.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"151.	Has anyone ever before succeeded in jointly elaborating practical standards of peaceful relations among States in Europe, in particular, on questions which have hitherto seemed insoluble? Until now nothing of this kind has been seen, at least on such a scale. Today, this work is proceeding successfully. Several important principles have been formulated in detail as specifically applicable to Europe. The arrival at generally acceptable decisions on them, on the basis of a reasonable balance of interests of the parties, is not a routine phenomenon. Not all the participants in the Conference rely, even in their bilateral relations, on such a solid foundation as the one which is now being laid for an all-European agreement.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"152.	It has also proved possible to reach agreement on a wide range of questions relating to cooperation among States in the most varied fields: from trade and economics to culture; from the protection of the environment to the extension of human contacts and exchanges of information. Experience has shown that such questions can be settled if they are viewed in direct proportion to the main problem of ensuring peace in Europe, and if the principle of non-interference in internal affairs is strictly adhered to.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"153.	The Soviet Union is convinced that there is an opportunity to conclude the Conference at an early date by adopting weighty decisions in the interests of security in Europe. In saying this we not only properly appreciate the collective work that has already been done; we also proceed from the premise that solutions to the still outstanding problems can be found, if all the participants display the necessary political will and realism.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"154.	Naturally, it would not be right to expect the Conference to settle at one fell swoop all the questions accumulated over the long years of tension and mistrust. But it is equal to the task of achieving agreements. on crucial problems which can determine a stable peaceful development in Europe for the foreseeable future. It will also be easier to tackle other outstanding issues in the atmosphere of detente. ",UNGD
RUS,1974,"155.	The Soviet Union will continue to do everything to ensure the complete success of the Conference. We trust that our Western partners will also take a constructive approach to this task. It is in the interests of the peoples of Europe, and not just of Europe alone, to work to bring nearer the day when agreements designed to legitimize peace and co-operation on the scale of an entire continent can be signed at the highest level.",UNGD
RUS,1974,156.	It is also important to achieve results at the Vienna Talks on the Mutual Reduction of Forces and Armaments and Associated Measures in Central Europe. The key to this is strict observance by all of the rule of undiminished security for each side. Agreement on the questions under discussion would in practice supplement political detente in Europe with military detente.,UNGD
RUS,1974,"157.	The conversion into a practical proposition of the idea of consolidating peace in Asia through the joint efforts of States should not, in our opinion, be a matter for the distant future. No doubt, the situation there remains complex. There is no small number of trouble spots, conflicts and international disputes on the continent of Asia.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"158.	Political thought in Asia, too, is switching more and more to the search for ways of securing peace and stability. And surely this is demonstrated by the efforts of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh to normalize relations on the Hindustan Peninsula, or by the idea of converting the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace.",UNGD
RUS,1974,159.	We note with satisfaction the growing interest in the Soviet Union's initiative concerning the establishment of a collective security system in Asia. More and more States in Asia are supporting it. The Soviet-Indian Declaration signed as a result of the visit of Leonid Uyich Brezhnev to India in November 1973 contains important principles which can serve as a basis for the development of an effective system of relations between States in Asia.,UNGD
RUS,1974,160.	The establishment of peace and co-operation in Asia meets the fundamental interests of all the Asian people. The achievement of this goal is a matter which concerns every country of that continent.,UNGD
RUS,1974,"161.	The agenda of this session includes an item which has a direct bearing on the improvement of the situation in Asia. This is the proposal by 34 States, including the Soviet Union, on the withdrawal of all foreign troops stationed in South Korea under the flag of the United Nations [AI9703 and Add. 1-3}. The presence of those troops, which have now been there for more than two decades, represents a source of constant military and political tension in the Korean Peninsula. Their presence is still more inappropriate under present conditions when, on the initiative of the Korean People's Democratic Republic, efforts are being made to bring about the peaceful reunification of Korea.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"162.	If we analyze the reasons which have so often caused acute tensions in the world, and which even now frequently lead to dangerous situations, we shall easily see that in many cases this was the result of the armaments race. It is indeed a fact that immediately after the Second World War some States embarked upon a course of building up armaments and setting up military bases on foreign territories, thus making the creation of tensions and saber- rattling their policy. It is a secret to no one that it was precisely that policy of theirs which at times brought the world to a very dangerous brink.",UNGD
RUS,1974,163.	How many speeches have been made on disarmament and the cessation of the arms race in the last 25 years? Probably no other problem has absorbed the attention of statesmen and public figures to such an extent in the post-war period. And this is understandable. Stable and lasting peace is incompatible with the arms race. They are antipodes. One cannot seriously think of eliminating the threat of war while at the same time increasing military budgets and endlessly building up armaments.,UNGD
RUS,1974,"164.	Facts must be faced. So far it has not proved possible to stop the arms race. Furthermore, today the arms race absorbs more money than ten or twenty years ago. It has been estimated that the world annually burns in the furnace of armaments over $250,000 million. This is more than the entire national income of the developing States of Asia and Africa. One can only imagine what benefits these resources could yield if they were used for peaceful purposes, for development, to combat hunger, poverty and disease.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"165.	No Government -at least openly- declares that it favors the arms race. Nevertheless, arms are accumulating. For three months every year appeals to end the arms race are heard at the session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. But the arms race continues. Ever more and newer papers and resolutions on disarmament are filling the archives of the United Nations. But disarmament still does not manage to overcome its inertia. Conveyor belts keep on moving inexorably, turning out new consignments of destructive weapons.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"166.	And so a paradoxical situation develops. The peace movement has never had such momentum as it enjoys today, and never has the world produced such quantities of arms as it does today. On the one hand, there is the longing for peace on the part of hundreds of millions of people who realize the grim danger of the arms race, but, on the other hand, there is the increasing avalanche of armaments.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"167.	What is the matter? Maybe some forces which have got out of human control are at work? Certainly not. The reason is policy. And if it is policy, well, one may ask, whose policy?",UNGD
RUS,1974,"168.	If it all depended on the socialist countries, the arms race would have been eliminated long ago. No one has tabled more concrete proposals on disarmament than they. Ever since the non-aligned countries moved into the forefront of international affairs they too have been actively working in favor of disarmament. Voices of reason are to be heard in other countries too, and they resound with ever greater confidence both in parliaments and in broad public circles,",UNGD
RUS,1974,"169.	Military-industrial circles that profit from the arms race oppose its cessation. Those politicians who are linked with these circles have long since placed their narrow interests above the aspirations of the peoples. The influence of these circles has had a telling effect on all disarmament negotiations, including those in the General Assembly and the Security Council. ",UNGD
RUS,1974,"170.	The arms race affects all States, even those not directly involved in it. All the peoples of the world live under one and the same roof. The risks posed by the unrestrained build-up of armaments are a danger to all. On the other hand, is there any country in the world whose economy is not affected, one way or another, by the burden of armaments? Everyone here could adduce numerous examples in confirmation of the correctness of this argument.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"171.	Furthermore, recently economic upheavals, which have been affecting many States, have increased in intensity and increasingly affect the material situation of people. Statesmen and economists are racking their brains over the causes underlying all this. But there is one undeniable conclusion that is borne out every day and every hour: the aggravation of economic problems is largely connected with the rising scale of the arms race and with soaring military expenditures.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"172.	But if the disarmament problem affects everyone, then the solution to the problem should be sought jointly by all States.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"173.	The main thing here is not just to mark time, hiding behind arguments about the complexity of the problem. If right now it cannot be solved at one stroke, solutions should be sought for individual aspects so that this should lead at least step by step to the ultimate goal of disarmament, and in effect, such an approach has already been tried out in recent years and has justified itself.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"174.	As positive changes make their way in the world, so objective prerequisites for finding real agreements in the sphere of disarmament improve. It is noteworthy that the largest number of agreements of this kind have been reached in the last few years. Although they do not reverse the arms race, they do curb it in a whole series of ways.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"175.	In one case, this takes the form of limiting further perfection of nuclear weapons and the creation of their new destructive models. The Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under Water, signed in Moscow on 5 August 1963, has been serving this end well for over a decade now.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"176.	The same objective is served by the Treaty between the Soviet Union and the United States of 3 July 1974, whereby both countries have undertaken to stop, as of 31 March 1976, underground testing of nuclear weapons with the most powerful nuclear charges and also to limit underground nuclear test explosions in general. The Soviet Union will strive to see to it that the prohibition of nuclear weapon tests eventually becomes comprehensive and universal.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"177.	In another case, it takes the form of a limit on the territorial spread of armaments. Such is the purport of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which has proved its effectiveness. We are in favor of making full use of the possibilities inherent in that Treaty and of increasing the number of States parties to it. The objective is to make this Treaty universal.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"178.	A number of agreements exclude the sea-bed and the ocean floor, outer space and celestial bodies from the sphere of possible emplacement of nuclear weapons. In accordance with an international agreement bacteriological weapons have been prohibited and eliminated from military arsenals, and prospects are emerging for the outlawing of another deadly means of warfare, namely, chemical weapons.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"179.	And what about the agreements on the limitation of strategic arms between the Soviet Union and the United States? I feel that there is no need to explain their unprecedented significance since they are designed to narrow the actual material basis of the nuclear-missile arms race. Quite recently these agreements have been supplemented by new important agreements. Last July, the Soviet Union and the United States decided further to limit their anti-ballistic missile systems and mapped out ways of achieving further limitation of strategic offensive arms in terms of both quality and quantity. The Soviet delegation in Geneva, where talks on these questions were resumed the other day, has firm instructions to seek their solution,",UNGD
RUS,1974,"180.	The supreme interests not only of the peoples of the Soviet Union and the United States but also of the peoples of the whole world require that the Soviet Union and the United States, possessing the colossal might of nuclear weapons, should make every effort to achieve appropriate understandings and agreements. We should like to express our gratification at the fact that this idea was clearly stated too from the rostrum of the General Assembly by President Ford of the United States [2234th meeting].",UNGD
RUS,1974,"181.	When two Powers voluntarily limit their military preparations, when they establish a ceiling above which they will not increase nuclear missile armaments, their actions, apart from anything else, must set a good example for others.",UNGD
RUS,1974,182.	The Soviet Union will continue to work tirelessly to further the cause of disarmament in areas where this is possible; it will look for new fields where concrete results can be achieved through the joint efforts of States.,UNGD
RUS,1974,"183.	The Soviet Union took the initiative by proposing the inclusion in the agenda of the twenty- ninth session of the General Assembly, as an important and urgent question, of item 103, entitled ""Prohibition of action to influence the environment and climate for military and other purposes incompatible with the maintenance of international security, human well- being and health"" [4/9702].",UNGD
RUS,1974,"184.	What is the motive for this? The achievements of scientific and technological progress have expanded the possibilities of influencing nature and the climate of the globe and, in a certain sense, of controlling the complex and powerful processes involved. Unfortunately, the latest discoveries can be used not only for creative, but also for military, purposes with extremely destructive consequences for mankind. These are not the conjectures of science fiction writers, but an actual threat that is assuming an ever more realistic shape. It is in the interests of all peoples to nip this threat in the bud.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"185.	The Soviet Union proposes that an international convention should be concluded which will outlaw the military use of the environment. Compliance with the provisions of such a convention, a draft of which we will submit [see AlC.JIL.675], could be secured through the adoption by each State, in accordance with its constitutional processes, of appropriate measures to prohibit activities contrary to the convention and through consultations and co-operation among States, notably within the framework of the United Nations.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"186.	The conclusion of such a convention would prevent the emergence of new means of warfare and, at the same time, would facilitate the solution of a problem common to all mankind the protection of the environment. We trust that all the participants in the Assembly will fully appreciate the universal significance of this important initiative and treat this proposal accordingly. The Soviet Union and the socialist countries as a whole seek to gain .nothing from this. We have made this proposal because it is in the interests of all States, all peoples and the whole world.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"187.	In its attitude in the United Nations, the Soviet Union proceeds on the assumption that the Organization can and must play an important part in developing and consolidating the positive processes characteristic of the present-day world situation. We have quite a number of useful resolutions to our credit aimed at strengthening international peace. Now, everything depends on their being consistently implemented.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"188.	In this regard, I should like to refer especially to some resolutions adopted by the United Nations over the last two or three years by a large majority of votes. In the first place, I have in mind the one on the prohibition of the use of force in international relations and the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons [resolution 2936 (XXVII)]. This is an Assembly decision of fundamental importance. It must acquire binding force for all States and, in this regard, the Security Council has an important role.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"189.	One cannot say that the General Assembly resolution on the convening of a world disarmament conference [resolution 2833 (XXVI)] has not been followed up. An Ad Hoc Committee on the World Disarmament Conference [resolution 3183 (XXVIII)] has even been set up, in which, among other States, three nuclear Powers are participating. However, in fact, the question is not really being dealt with. It is time for the Committee to proceed, in close co-operation with the nuclear Powers, to prepare concrete recommendations on the practical aspects of the convocation of that conference. The boycotting of this important measure by several States is contrary to the clearly expressed desire of the overwhelming majority of States Members of the United Nations. We regard it as a challenge to the world Organization.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"190.	Through no fault of the Soviet Union, there is delay in the implementation of such a commonly useful enterprise as that of the reduction of the military budgets of the States permanent members of the Security Council by 10 per cent and the utilization of part of the funds thus saved to provide assistance to developing countries. This example belongs in the same category. This action would have a double effect: it would promote the limitation of the arms race and, at the same time, provide additional assistance to States that need it most. The attitudes towards this proposal act as a kind of litmus paper revealing the intentions of States regarding acute present-day problems.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"191.	The further development of bilateral relations between States based on the principles of peaceful coexistence is a vast and far from exhausted reserve for deepening detente. On this basis our country is prepared to establish and expand not just normal but, where possible, friendly relations with all States sharing this approach. This has been and remains one of the most important lines of the Soviet Union's foreign policy.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"192.	It is our desire to see the consolidation of all the positive results that have been achieved so far in our relations with leading capitalist States on the basis of fruitful efforts on both sides. We' want to move ahead and make these relations stable. In this context, the statements by the new leaders of the United States, France and the Federal Republic of Germany about their intentions to continue to move towards detente and co-operation have been met in the Soviet Union with satisfaction.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"193.	Today economic, scientific and technological links assume an increasingly large role in relations between States with different social systems. If co-operation in these fields is built on respect for the principles of equality and non-interference, it will not only be mutually advantageous but will also promote the establishment of a material basis of sorts for durable peace and good neighborliness.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"194.	We value highly the good and, in some instances, close relations which have been established between the Soviet Union and many developing countries. The countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America which have embarked upon the road of national independence and the consolidation of economic independence can continue to rely firmly on our support. We were in at the source of their struggle against colonialism, and at each and every stage of it we have supported and will continue to support the developing States in word and in deed. That is our line of principle, and we shall not deviate from it.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"195.	The solution of such complex and urgent problems as those of energy and food, which are attracting much attention, particularly in the United Nations, should also be sought on the path of peace and co-operation, of strict observance of the principles of equality and sovereignty, and of the right of States to dispose of their natural resources.",UNGD
RUS,1974,196.	The number of young States Members of the United Nations has increased at this session of the General Assembly. We should like to express our particular satisfaction at the fact that the People's Republic of Bangladesh has become a full Member of the United Nations and that thus an end has been put to an injustice with regard to that major Asian State.,UNGD
RUS,1974,"197.	The Soviet Union, which was one of the first countries to establish diplomatic relations with the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, welcomes that State's admission to the United Nations with great satisfaction. The Soviet Union also welcomes the admission to the United Nations of the newly independent State of Grenada. Soon to come is the proclamation of the national independence of Mozambique. The current attempts to frustrate the process of decolonization that has begun in that country must be most resolutely rebuffed. That of course applies equally and fully to Angola. That will, indeed, be the crowning moment of the armed phase of the struggle for national liberation of the former Portuguese colonies, and will provide even further evidence of the irresistible march of social progress.",UNGD
RUS,1974,"198.	The year that has passed since the Fascist coup in Chile has revealed the great depth of the tragedy that has befallen the Chilean people. But it has also demonstrated that endless terror and the suppression of elementary human rights cannot break the will of the people of Chile for a free and independent life. The bloody deeds of the junta are in glaring contradiction with the lofty human principles and purposes of the United Nations, and are a challenge to human honor and decency. It is no accident that the junta in fact remains in a state of international isolation.",UNGD

But that struggle is by no means ended.

RUS,1974,-to resume as a matter of urgency the work of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East to solve questions concerning the establishment of a just and durable peace in that area;,UNGD
RUS,1974,"-to complete the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe at an early date by adopting, at the highest level, decisions ensuring a peaceful future for Europe;",UNGD
RUS,1974,"-to achieve specific agreements in the Soviet- American Strategic Arms Limitation Talks, in the multilateral negotiations on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe, and in the Committee on Disarmament;",UNGD
RUS,1974,-to take measures to implement the decisions of the sixth special session of the General Assembly on strengthening the economic independence of developing States.,UNGD
RUS,1974,"201.	No one would venture to claim that the solution of all those problems, and of others to which we have drawn the attention of this Assembly, is an easy task. But their solution is necessary and feasible, and all States really interested in developing peaceful and reasonable forms of international inter-course should work towards that end. The Soviet Union will be unstinting in its efforts to promote the establishment of durable and lasting peace on earth.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"104.	 Mr. President, on behalf of the delegation of the Soviet Union I should like to congratulate you on the occasion of your election to the high position of President of the General Assembly for its thirtieth session and I wish you full success in the discharge of this most important function.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"105.	For three decades now, regular sessions of the General Assembly have been held towards the end of each year. And each session becomes a significant event in international life. Indeed, the United Nations activities are focused on the most important and acute problems.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"106.	If we try to visualize with our mind's eye the work of our Organization over all these years, we shall see a vivid picture of the concerns and anxieties, aspirations and hopes of mankind, permeated by a desire, common to all peoples, for peace and for material, social and spiritual progress.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"107.	Whether or not international developments are in line with that desire, this should be, above all, the starting-point in analyzing the state of affairs in the world. It is from this angle that the Soviet Union views the situation in which representatives of States have gathered for the thirtieth session of the General Assembly.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"108.	The main feature of the situation is that the process of relaxation of international tensions is gaining in scope, and detente itself is increasingly gaining substance. This finds its expression, in particular, in the conclusion of a whole number of agreements between States, including the well-known Soviet- American agreements, which are ot great importance for the cause of peace and international security.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"109.	And though the process of improving the political climate is still being influenced by various, sometimes conflicting, factors, it can be definitely stated that in the past year a new significant step has been taken along the path leading, towards a more durable peace.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"110.	The peaceful foreign policy of the USSR, a policy of socialism, is aimed at those objectives, at the strengthening of international security. Those objectives were set forth by the great Lenin himself, back in the early years of the existence of the Soviet State, and our country has been invariably guided by them throughout its historical march.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"111.	Following this course, a course embodied in the Peace Program adopted by the Twenty-Fourth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the USSR is an active participant in, and in many instances a sponsor of, efforts radically to improve the international situation.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"112.	In present-day conditions, we believe it feasible, though not at all easy, to carry out a restructuring of relations among States such as would leave no room for wars between them and would secure respect for the rights of all peoples, large or small, to free and independent development.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"113.	The principled foreign policy line of the USSR will, no doubt, be reaffirmed and expanded in the decisions of the forthcoming Twenty-Fifth Congress of the Party of Soviet communists early next year. All those who fight for the peace, national independence and social progress of peoples can continue to count on our solidarity and active support.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"114.	In pursuing its policy of peace, the Soviet Union acts in the world arena in close unity with the fraternal socialist countries. And we are proud that the peaceful policies of the socialist countries are in keeping with ti.s aspirations of all peoples.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"115.	This yea.' will remain in the memory of the peoples as the year of the conclusion of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. The Final Act of the Conference, to which the signatures of top leaders of 33 European countries, the United States of America and Canada were affixed in Helsinki, in one of the most outstanding documents of our times.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"116.	The peoples of Europe to a very large extent pinned on the Conference the hope that the European continent would be able, at last, to break out of the vicious circle of its history where every post-war period turned into a pre-war period, to be followed by a war unleashed by aggressors. The peoples of Europe expected that the Conference would work out and adopt important decisions in the interests of ensuring their security and agree on the main directions for equal and versatile co-operation. Everywhere in Europe people wished the Conference to succeed.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"117.	The participants in the Conference succeeded through intense collective efforts in achieving important results, which have been clearly recorded in the Final Act.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"118.	This concerns, above all, the political sphere —the working out of principles governing relations among the participating States. Provided they are strictly observed by all States, the threat of war will be excluded from the life of the peoples of Europe and an atmosphere of trust in the peaceful development of each country will come into being on the continent.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"119.	This is also true and applicable with regard to the stability and confidence measures agreed on at the Conference, which are designed to promote a reduction of the risk of armed conflicts in Europe.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"120.	A positive role is to be played by the understandings reached at the Conference on co-operation in the fields of trade, large-scale industrial projects, science and technology, and the protection of the environment.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"121.	A substantial contribution to the development of co-operation between the States participating in the Conference are the understandings reached on questions of co-operation in the fields of culture, information, contacts and education, and their significance will be ever increasingly felt as detente deepens and develops.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"122.	It is not without a sense of satisfaction that I note that the success of the Conference was largely facilitated by the efforts of the socialist countries, which invariably seek to switch international relations on to the track of peaceful coexistence. This success became possible also because in Western countries the well-founded conviction is gaining strength that it is necessary to adopt a constructive approach to the solution of problems that arise in Europe instead of aggravating and inflaming the situation, which in the past often reached dangerous levels.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"123.	The understandings reached as a result of the Conference are based on the recognition by all its participants of the absolute truth that respect for the sovereign equality of States, the non-use of force, the inviolability of frontiers, territorial integrity, nonintervention from outside in the internal affairs of States as well as other basic principles are laws which no one may transgress.",UNGD
RUS,1975,124.	What are the implications of the result of this joint work of 35 States for the peoples of Europe and indeed of the entire world?,UNGD
RUS,1975,"125.	The answer is provided by the experience of the past, when a desire to seize others' territories and brute force raised to the level of State policy acquired the character of criminal claims to world domination and developed into the brown plague of fascism, racism, direct aggression and the tragedy of world wars. Now 35 States which took part in the Conference have assumed, jointly and before the whole world, the obligation to build their relations on the principles of peace, and peace alone, and of deeper co-operation.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"126.	The results of the Conference constitute a carefully weighed balance of the interests of all its participants, and they reflect generally acceptable understandings and well-founded compromises. We have every reason to state that the experience of the Conference should be used most extensively for the settlement in general of the pressing problems of today.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"127.	In short, as was stressed by L. I. Brezhnev in his speech at Helsinki:",UNGD
RUS,1975,"""The results of the prolonged negotiations are such that there are neither victors nor vanquished, neither winners nor losers. This is a victory for reason. Everyone has won the countries of the East and of the West , the peoples of socialist and capitalist States, parties to alliances and neutrals, large and small. This is a gain for all people who hold dear the cause of peace and security on our planet.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"128.	Assessing highly the results of the Conference, the Soviet Union believes that the main task now is to translate the understandings reached into deeds, and to advance towards new milestones in the struggle for a lasting peace. This is the course the Soviet Union follows and will continue to follow, and this is what we also expect others to do.",UNGD
RUS,1975,129.	Who would contest that the year 1975 will go down in history as the year of the triumph of the just cause of the peoples of Indo-China? Triumph crowned their liberation struggle that had been carried on for almost 30 years against colonialists and aggression.,UNGD
RUS,1975,"130.	Those people sustained tremendous losses, but their will for freedom was never broken. The victory won by the peoples of Indo-China is above all the result of their own efforts. At the same time, it is also a major and common success of all the peace-loving and progressive: forces which invariably demonstrated their solidarity with the struggle of the patriots of Viet Nam, Laos and Cambodia, and provided them with moral and material support.",UNGD
RUS,1975,131.	The Soviet Union as the whole world knows has fulfilled its internationalist duty to the Vietnamese people. It has sought persistently the elimination in,UNGD
RUS,1975,Indo-China of one of the most dangerous hot-beds of war which troubled international relations.,UNGD
RUS,1975,"132.	Understandably, the removal of that hot-bed was welcomed everywhere with a sense of relief. Now that freedom and peace have dawned over the whole of Indo-China, favorable prospects are opening up for its peoples to begin healing the wounds of war and building a new life, which they are doing with the dedication and heroism so characteristic of them.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"133.	Having defended their sovereignty and independence in the long struggle, the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam now express their willingness to participate within the framework of this world Organization also in efforts to develop international co-operation. We are convinced that the admission to the United Nations of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam would be fully in keeping with the lofty purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter; and the Soviet Union supports the request of their Governments to that effect. No one who stands for peace should fear such a decision of the United Nations.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"134.	The lessons of Indo-China are simple and obvious. The struggle of peoples for freedom, national independence and social progress is invincible. It cannot be destroyed by bullets or fire. The outcome of many years of conflict in Indo-China is a convincing case in point. It is also clear that any attempt to dictate or to impose one's will on other peoples by force of arms is untenable and in the final account doomed to failure.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"135.	This is a good lesson, in the sense that the policy of acting from ""positions of strength"", which has now been rejected also at the conference table in Helsinki, should be relegated to the archives of history, never to be revived.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"136.	The radical change in the state of affairs in Indo-China creates more favorable prerequisites for establishing peaceful co-operation in Asia as a whole. Practical steps in this direction would serve the interests of the settlement of urgent problems and the strengthening of security throughout the continent of Asia which of course requires, as in Europe, collective efforts by all States concerned, both large and small. And it is through such efforts, and subject to strict compliance with the principles of equality and non- use of force in any guise in resolving disputes between States, that a most effective solution of the problem of Asian security can be found. Let no one think that the Soviet Union would benefit from such a turn of events in Asia to a greater extent than some other States. Not at all; objectively all countries of Asia are equally interested in this.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"137.	The entire course of world events in recent times confirms the conclusion reached a long time ago by all those who stand on the ground of reality, that only the policy of peaceful coexistence of States with different social systems can have a future and is in keeping with the interests of the peoples.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"138.	Our country, the Soviet Union, which is faithful to the legacy of Lenin, carries on a tireless struggle for the further establishment of these principles as a generally recognized rule of international relations. In our relationships with countries of different social systems 'here are a good many positive elements which serve both our interests and those of our partners in corresponding agreements and understandings. This finds its expression in particular in the development of relations between the Soviet Union and the United States of America in recent years, primarily as a result of Soviet-American summit meetings, which favorably influences the situation in the world as a whole.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"139.	A joint search for solutions of urgent problems, including their consideration at the very highest level, the development of political contacts, the expansion of economic, scientific, technological and cultural exchanges have already yielded tangible results which have a positive impact on the general state of international relations and strengthen the spirit of trust in them, without which relations among States cannot be built on a solid basis.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"140.	The Soviet Union continues to consolidate friendly relations with developing countries with which we are united by a common desire for peace and progress. We have invariably rendered and will continue to render support to the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America and to the movement of non- aligned States in their struggle to consolidate their national sovereignty and economic independence, to overcome the grim legacy of the colonial past, and against intrigues aimed at undermining their independence and infringing upon their legitimate rights.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"141.	Step by step the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America are freeing themselves of the consequences of the ""cold war"" and its distortions in politics. In this respect the decision by Latin American States to put an end to the policy of boycotting socialist Cuba, a policy imposed upon them, was an important event.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"142.	It is quite natural that it should be precisely in the present-day situation that the last pillars of colonialism, built up over centuries, are falling down. Quite recently, Mozambique, Cape Verde, Sao Tome and Principe, the Comoros and Papua New Guinea have joined the ranks of independent States. Our country welcomes the victory of the just cause of their peoples.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"143.	We congratulate the representatives present in this Hall of the Republic of Cape Verde, the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe, and the People's Republic of Mozambique, which have become full-fledged Members of our Organization.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"144.	Of course, the completion of the process of decolonization is not proceeding without difficulties. The events in Angola, for example, testify to this. The forces hostile to the liberation struggle of peoples do not surrender their positions without fighting. They sometimes find accomplices also among those who like to pose as zealous champions of the good of oppressed peoples while in practice they are in collusion with the oppressors.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"145.	But in spite of all difficulties, the struggle for the elimination of the vestiges of colonialism, for the uprooting of racism, is now closer to final victory than ever before.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"146.	The States of Asia, Africa and Latin America constitute a great and active force in world politics, and this imposes on them a grave responsibility for the state of affairs in the world. We view with understanding the fact that these countries, still suffering from the consequences of exploitation, discrimination and economic coercion, are today participating in the work of putting forward and elaborating proposals to establish such international economic relations as would be based on equality and justice.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"147.	The solution of those questions, too, is inseparably connected with the further relaxation of political tensions in the world. The Soviet Union is fully aware of the legitimate interests and demands of the developing countries, and it based itself precisely upon such positions in the course of the recently concluded seventh special session of the General Assembly, the results of which we assess positively, although it is quite clear to everyone that much has still to be done before the relevant problems are actually solved.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"148.	Thus, the past was marked by significant inter-national events of a positive nature. It is not for us, the socialist States, to underestimate the significance of successes in the international arena. Their contribution to the struggle for those successes is common knowledge.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"149.	At the same time, one should be clearly conscious of the fact that detente is not a process which develops by its own momentum. For detente to move ahead, ever new impulses must be given it. A continuous day-to-day struggle must be conducted for it in international forums and from parliamentary rostrums. Each State, each Government, should realize that it can and should make its own contribution to detente.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"150.	We deem it necessary to state this from the rostrum of the United Nations because, as facts prove, it would be wrong to underestimate the resistance of the enemies of detente.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"151.	Designs dangerous to the cause of international co-operation continue to originate in their camp. And in this connexion no small arsenal of means is put into action, ranging from the direct use of force against other countries and peoples to demagoguery which exploits the tenacity of the ""cold-war"" dogmas and sows doubts as to the benefits of detente for all peoples.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"152.	The same forces which once in the past sought to thwart the convening of the all-European Conference, and later on tried to prevent it from succeeding, attempt to question the effectiveness of its results.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"153.	However the problem does not only lie in tendentious propaganda campaigns against detente and international actions aimed at deepening it; what is even more dangerous is the continuous policy of interference which endangers the independence of States, even though such a policy may be camouflaged words in defense of the ideals of freedom and democracy. Two years ago, this policy paved the way for the bloody Fascist coup in Chile. Today, almost the same methods are used to exacerbate the situation concerning some other countries.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"154.	The world is deeply concerned over the blatant attempts to bring outside pressure to bear on Portugal, clearly made with the intent to compel the Portuguese people to abandon their chosen road of free development.",UNGD
RUS,1975,155.	The interests of solving the complex political and economic problems faced by Portugal require that a calm situation be ensured with regard to that country. No one can be allowed to flout the inalienable right of the Portuguese people to determine its destiny independently and without outside interference. Such is the position on which the Soviet Union has proceeded and will continue to proceed.,UNGD
RUS,1975,"156.	Opponents of the process of detente will try to slow it down. But if we ask all those who, overtly or semi-overtly, today come out against the line of lessening international tensions what alternative they offer, they cannot come up with anything intelligible. In reality, their policy has but one answer, an answer which would tend to reserve this process and bring it back to the times of the ""cold war"".",UNGD
RUS,1975,"157.	Herein lies the watershed between those who in practice stand for peace, for the improvement of relations between States and for the development of peaceful co-operation in all fields and they are backed by the peoples and those who reject this course in the development of world affairs, who would rather push the world towards the old path of tension, clashes between States, and an unrestrained arms race with all the ensuing dangers.",UNGD
RUS,1975,158.	All participants in this world forum of States would probably agree that one of the main tasks in the international sphere remains the elimination of the hot-beds of armed conflict. One need not dwell on the gravity of the threat when in this or that hot-bed the conflict suddenly flares up and again produces a crisis. The world has repeatedly faced such a turn of events and knows full well how hard it is to put out the flames of war.,UNGD
RUS,1975,"159.	This, above all, concerns the Middle East, where a dangerous situation has persisted for many years.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"160.	The essence of the conflict, its origins and causes are well knwon. What is required for the solution of the problem is no secret either. Only those do not see it who do not wish to. To establish a just and lasting peace in the Middle East in the interests of all States of the area and peoples inhabiting it, it is necessary that Israeli forces be withdrawn from all the Arab territories occupied by them in 1967; to ensure the lawful rights of the Arab people of Palestine, including their right to establish their own State; to guarantee the rights of all the countries of the Middle East to independent development. I repeat, ""all"" the countries of the Middle East.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"161.	A Middle East settlement cannot make headway if those crucial problems are left unsolved. Without their solution a settlement in the Middle East can only be delayed indefinitely, with increasing dangers for the situation. No palliative measures or camouflaging can change the substance of the matter.",UNGD
RUS,1975,162.	The problem of the Middle East must be free from an approach based on momentary considerations and publicity. It can be solved in the interests of the security and independence of all the countries of the region only in conditions of a serious and responsible approach to its solution.,UNGD
RUS,1975,"163.	From all appearances, the circles which determine the political course of Israel have not yet realized that it is impossible to ensure the security of the country while trampling upon the legitimate rights of other countries which are jits neighbors. That policy naturally meets with broad condemnation. The Soviet Union, too, decisively condemns it.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"164.	The main problems of the Middle East are still awaiting solution. There is appropriate machinery for their examination the Geneva Peace Conference. The Soviet Union stands for the reconvening of the Conference with the participation of all—and I stress ""all""—parties concerned, including representatives of the Palestine Liberation Organization. It will be recalled that the General Assembly at its twenty- ninth session reaffirmed by an overwhelming majority the right of the Arab people of Palestine to self-determination and national sovereignty [resolution 3236 (XXIX)\. The solution of the Palestine problem is an integral part of an over-all settlement in the Middle East. Today this is axiomatic and politicians cannot pretend that they do not see it.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"165.	The main thing with which the participants should come to the Conference is a firm desire jointly to seek acceptable solutions. The Soviet Union, for its part, is ready to continue to do everything so that the Middle East may become an area of lasting and durable peace. That is what we mainly want to see in the Middle East, an area adjacent to the southern borders of our country.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"166.	The Soviet Union consistently pursues a policy of friendship with the Arab countries, which are defending their just cause. This friendship is deeply ingrained and we do not believe that anyone will succeed in undermining it. The Soviet Union will continue to do everything in its power to consolidate this friendship on a basis of justice and principle.",UNGD
RUS,1975,167.	The situation in and around Cyprus still remains complicated. To satisfy interests alien to Cyprus the sovereignty of that small country and the inalienable rights of its people have been trampled upon for more than a year.,UNGD
RUS,1975,"168.	The Soviet Union has consistently come out in defence of the independence and the territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus, for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the island, and for the settlement of the internal matters of their State by the two communities, Greek and Turkish, themselves. In other words, we are for the implementation of the well-known United Nations decisions on Cyprus. It is only on such a basis that a just settlement of the Cyprus problem and the elimination of this hotbed of tension will be possible.",UNGD
RUS,1975,169.	The precarious state of armistice obviously does not ensure the stabilization of the state of affairs on the Korean peninsula. The need to create conditions for establishing durable peace on the Korean peninsula and speeding up the peaceful reunification of Korea has long been pressing.,UNGD
RUS,1975,"170.	Those goals would be served by a cessation of outside interference in the internal affairs of the Korean people and, in the first place, the withdrawal from South Korea of all foreign troops stationed there under the United Nations flag, as well as by the conclusion of a peace treaty. It is the duty of the United Nations to assist in every possible way in taking such steps. This can be done on the basis of the proposals put forward at the current session of the General",UNGD
RUS,1975,"Assembly by a large group of States, including the Soviet Union.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"171.	The process of lessening tensions in the world, the very logic of its development, pose most acutely the question of the need to curb the arms race. The measures taken in this direction in recent years are to be commended. We attach great importance also to the negotiations now under way aimed at working out a new long-term agreement between the Soviet Union and the United States of America on the limitation of strategic offensive weapons. Its conclusion will be a new and major step forward, not only in bilateral Soviet-American relations, but in a wider international context as well.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"172.	Hardly anyone would dispute the fact that everything that has been achieved in the field of disarm-ament so far represents but the first steps. Indeed, mankind so far has been unable to check the arms race or even substantially to slow down its pace. It goes on in the direction both of developing ever more destructive means of warfare and of building up the total volume of armaments.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"173.	The Soviet Union is convinced that in the conditions of a relaxation of tensions in the world the prerequisites have been created for the implementation of effective measures which would end the arms race. In other words, it is now not only necessary but also possible to supplement political detente with military detente. The States participating in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe unanimously pronounced themselves in favor of this in the Final Act.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"174.	The Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, held last May at Geneva, came out for the implementation of broad measures for the limitation of the arms race ana fcr disarmament. It is precisely such specific steps towards easing the burden of armaments that become the touchstone for testing the genuine readiness of States and Governments to pursue the course of peace.",UNGD
RUS,1975,175.	The struggle for disarmament has always been and continues to be an integral part of the foreign policy line of the Soviet Union. The USSR is a permanent and active participant in negotiations on various aspects of the disarmament problem.,UNGD
RUS,1975,"176.	We attach great importance to the lessening of military confrontation in areas where it is especially dangerous. Now, following the conclusion of the all- European Conference, one of the primary tasks is to find ways towards agreement on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in central Europe, without infringing the security of anyone. The Soviet Union will contribute in every way to the success of the talks on this problem currently under way in Vienna.",UNGD
RUS,1975,177.	Within the framework of the United Nations we have on more than one occasion already stated in detail our position on disarmament questions. And we have not merely stated it. The Soviet Union has put forward a large number of specific proposals many of which have formed the basis of important decisions adopted by the United Nations. We have consistently supported their implementation. This applies in particular to the resolution of the twenty- seventh session of the General Assembly on the non-use of force in international relations and the simultaneous permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons [resolution 2936 (XXVII)].,UNGD
RUS,1975,178.	Another question raised by the Soviet Union the reduction of the military budgets of States permanent members of the United Nations Security Council also retains the utmost importance..,UNGD
RUS,1975,"179.	We consider it important speedily to conclude an international convention on the prohibition of military or any other hostile use of techniques to influence the environment. The conclusion of such a convention would be not only a means of limiting the sphere of the arms race, but also an important means of preserving the environment, which would meet the vital interests of all States and peoples. We would like to express the hope that agreement will be reached on this matter in the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament, where a relevant draft is under consideration.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"180.	In the field of disarmament, as in other matters, the Soviet Union adopts a realistic approach. It is constantly seeking areas of disarmament and arms- race limitation in which it is feasible to find commonly acceptable agreements.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"181.	At the same time, we have never overlooked the main objective general and complete disarmament. We are of the view that this problem should be in the forefront of the attention of the World Disarmament Conference. The United Nations has already approved the idea of convening it. In that forum all countries of the world could, on an equal footing and freely, set out and compare their positions and outline ways and means of limiting and arresting the arms race.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"182.	It is high time that efforts were made to complete preparations for the conference and to convene it. As is well known, this is something in which the Soviet Union will not be, and has not been, found wanting.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"183.	The Soviet delegation would like to draw your attention to two aspects of the disarmament problem on which, in our view, decisions are required and can be taken in practice at the earliest possible date.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"184.	We all realize the importance of scientific and technological progress. The mission of science is noble and humane in essence. It expands the horizons of human knowledge, makes knowledge a powerful force of economic development, of raising the well- being of peoples and their cultural levels, and links countries together by bonds of peaceful co-operation.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"185.	Quite recently the entire world was given new proof of this. We are referring to the outstanding international experiment in outer space, the docking and joint flight of the Soviet and American space craft, ""Soyuz"" and ""Apollo"". The • handshake in orbit, as this experiment is now known, has rightfully become a symbol of the fruitful union of scientific achievements and the policy of peaceful coexistence.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"186.	The USSR is a consistent champion of the use of science exclusively for peaceful purposes and in the interest of mankind, and is prepared for wide, large-scale co-operation in the sphere of science and technology with all States interested in this.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"187.	However, the experience of the past shows that achievements in science and technology can be used for dangerous, even criminal purposes.",UNGD
RUS,1975,188.	With today's rapid development of science and technology in various countries new types and new systems of weapons of mass destruction could emerge in various places. One can assume with a high degree of certainty that they would be even more ominous than those existing at present.,UNGD
RUS,1975,"189.	None of this can be ignored. Further, it is well known how difficult it is to withdraw any weapon that has already been developed from the arsenals of States, and consequently how much safer and more reasonable it is to prevent its emergence in advance. If things are viewed from that angle, the need for, the urgency of, effective measures to prohibit the development of new types and new systems of weapons of mass destruction should become absolutely evident.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"190.	Proceeding from this, aware of its responsibility as a permanent member of the Security Council, the Soviet Union proposes the inclusion in the agenda of the current session of the General Assembly as an important and urgent matter of item 126 entitled ""Prohibition of the development and manufacture of new types of weapons of mass destruction and new systems of such weapons"".",UNGD
RUS,1975,"191.	We propose that States, and first of all the major Powers, conclude an agreement based on an undertaking neither to develop nor to manufacture new types and new systems of such weapons and not to assist in or encourage any activities in that direction.",UNGD
RUS,1975,192.	The need may arise to be more specific as to the categories of weapons which should be covered by the ban. The Soviet Union is prepared to take part in a detailed examination of this question in the course of appropriate negotiations. It is ready to speak out on the substance of this matter and to put forward most concrete proposals.,UNGD
RUS,1975,"193.	The draft agreement which we submit to the General Assembly [see A/10243, annex] is worded in such a way that, while banning the development of new types and new systems of weapons of mass destruction, the agreement would not at the same time impede the economic, scientific and technical development of States parties and would not infringe their right to make use of scientific research and discoveries for peaceful purposes, for the benefit of people and without any discrimination.",UNGD
RUS,1975,194.	Such an international agreement would make a major contribution to the cause of limiting the arms race and to the cause of further easing international tensions. We should like to express our hope that our proposal will find support from the participants in this session and that other countries will join us in our initiative.,UNGD
RUS,1975,"195.	In submitting^ our second proposal we were moved by the same concern, that of delivering mankind from the danger of war; by the desire to curb the race in the most pernicious weapons at present in the arsenals of States, nuclear weapons. Its purpose is to end completely nuclear weapon tests and thus radically to limit the practical possibilities for perfecting it further.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"196.	Major steps have already been taken towards this aim: the 1963 Moscow Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and Under Water,"" and the 1974 Treaty between the USSR and the United States of America on the limitation of underground nuclear weapons tests.2",UNGD
RUS,1975,"197.	_ In our view, conditions are ripe at present for the final step along this road: to conclude a broad international agreement imposing a ban on all nuclear weapon tests without exception.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"198.	In line with this approach, the Soviet Union has already proposed the inclusion in the agenda of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly of an important and urgent item entitled ""Conclusion of a treaty on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear weapon tests"" [item 122].",UNGD
RUS,1975,"199.	In accordance with the draft treaty which is submitted for the consideration of Member States [see AH0241, annex], its adherents would undertake from now on not to manufacture nuclear weapons and to prohibit and prevent any test explosions of nuclear weapons in any environment, including the underground environment. Such an obligation must, of course, be assumed by all States, including all nuclear Powers.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"200.	While outlawing all nuclear weapon tests, the treaty must not at the same time deny access to the benefits of the peaceful uses of nuclear explosions for both nuclear-weapon and non-nuclear-weapon countries.",UNGD
RUS,1975,201.	We hope that the General Assembly will support our initiative for the conclusion of a treaty on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear weapon tests.,UNGD
RUS,1975,202.	The implementation of the proposals submitted by the Soviet Union for consideration at the present session is in our view an integral part of the fulfillment of the general task which life itself has today made the corner-stone of all United Nations activities. The essence of the task is to promote the further development of the positive processes taking place in the world and to make them irreversible.,UNGD
RUS,1975,203.	We are convinced that the United Nations is equal to that task. Our world Organization has accumulated enormous experience in the multilateral co-operation of States. That valuable asset can and must be constantly employed for the benefit of peace.,UNGD
RUS,1975,"204.	The successful fulfillment of its lofty mission by the United Nations as an important instrument for consolidating international security, particularly in the present-day most responsible period, presupposes constant enhancement of the effectiveness of its work. That need is ever greater, since some useful decisions of the United Nations still remain unimplemented, and that plays into the hands of those who would like to maintain hotbeds of the danger of war, colonial domination and remnants of racism.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"205.	It would do no harm to recall once again from this rostrum that, as regards the obligation to comply strictly with the provisions of the United Nations Charter, there can be no exceptions for any of its Members. The Charter is the foundation of the entire structure of the United Nations. It has stood the test of time, and fully retains its significance for the future.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"It is in the strict observance of the Charter, rather than in its revision, that one should look for resources for the further enhancement of the effectiveness of the United Nations and the strengthening of its authority.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"206.	The lofty purposes and principles proclaimed in the Charter are an embodiment of the collective quest of the peoples for peace and progress. They were born out of the flames of the greatest tragedy that has ever befallen mankind. Celebrating this year the thirtieth anniversary of the end of the Second World War, the peoples look to the future with hope.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"207.	The greatness of the exploits performed in the struggle against fascism and aggression by the peoples of the Soviet Union and the peoples of all countries who, during the years of war, combined their efforts in the name of victory and founded the United Nations, setting themselves the task of saving present and succeeding generations from the scourge of war, will never fade.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"208.	In the three decades since the end of the Second World War a great distance has been covered in the struggle for international security. Particularly impressive are the successes achieved in recent years, which graphically prove that the prevention of wars between States is not a Utopian but an attainable goal. However, that must not be a source of complacency. There is still much to be done to achieve a truly stable peace on earth.",UNGD
RUS,1975,"209.	As for the Soviet Union, we wish to see no stops on this road, no zigzags and, above all, no reversals. Substantial steps in that direction can be made here, at this General Assembly, and we are willing to take a most active part in this common endeavor.",UNGD
RUS,1975,,UNGD

RUS,1975,,UNGD
RUS,1976,"On behalf of the Soviet delegation I should like to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the important post of President of the thirty- first session of the United Nations General Assembly. I wish you all success in the performance of this honorable and responsible task.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"146.	The United Nations operates uninterruptedly all year round and, like international politics, it knows no interludes. But the annual sessions of such a forum as the General Assembly are of special significance. They provide an opportunity-now to almost 150 States -to scan the political panorama of the world in all its diversity, to identify the main problems that await solution and, most important, to provide by joint efforts, new momentum to international co-operation.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"147.	The very emergence of the United Nations as an international organization on the crest of the great victory over the forces of fascism and aggression was an expression of the will of the peoples of the world to prevent another war. In the name of those who perished and those who survived, its founding States declared their determination ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war"".",UNGD
RUS,1976,"148.	Now, as then, the peoples of the world have every right to demand of their political leaders, Governments and parliaments that efforts to strengthen peace be intensified and not slackened.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"149.	We are very far from underestimating the United Nations. After all, the Soviet Union is one of its founders. The United Nations has given useful and significant support to the peoples of the world in their struggle for liberation from colonial oppression. It has also made a weighty contribution to getting negotiations under way and preparing agreements which have curbed the arms race in certain areas. In certain cases it has been helpful in extinguishing conflicts. All these things are true.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"150.	Nevertheless, if the role of the United Nations is viewed in terms of the problems which still remain on the political agenda of the world there are at least two questions which arise.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"151.	First, is the United Nations potential always fully exploited whenever tension grows or blood is shed in any given part of the world? No. The United Nations does not always measure up to the situation. This was true in the case of IndoChina. It is still true in the Middle East. It is true in Cyprus, and it is true in southern Africa.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"152.	As a result, people's faith in the effectiveness of the United Nations and its ability to give the necessary support to the victims of aggression is undermined.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"153.	When anyone succumbs to the temptation to use force to seize the lands of others or tramples upon the right of peoples to free development, then there arises the question of what has become of his signature on the Charter of the United Nations. No matter how you put it, one thing is clear: such a policy is alien to the interests of peace and to the noble goals in the name of which the new international Organization was brought into being. And this is precisely why all too often the Security Council finds itself paralyzed, while many United Nations resolutions remain mere ink and paper.",UNGD
RUS,1976,154.	The second question is this. Has the United Nations really addressed itself to the task of solving the most burning issue facing mankind today-the elimination of the threat of another world war? Unfortunately this question cannot be answered affirmatively either.,UNGD
RUS,1976,"155.	Whenever the General Assembly meets, it discusses at its sessions some hundred items and adopts even more resolutions. At times the resolutions are so eloquent, and their verbal fabric so splendid, that they could be hung around this hall as slogans.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"156.	But resolutions are resolutions, and at the same time there is the gigantic machinery of arms production, or, in other words, of material preparation for war, continuing to gather momentum. Figuratively speaking, the globe, or at any rate a sizable part of it, is criss-crossed with assembly lines continuously churning out ever deadlier weapons -land-based, airborne, underwater weapons and whatever others you care to name.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"157.	And many political figures who have linked their careers with the arms race and who are building their policies on that basis are clamoring for the development of ever newer weapons of destruction and annihilation. Not satisfied with wingless missiles, they want winged missiles. The B-type bomber no longer suits them. They must have the B-l, or, better still, a C-type.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"158.	It is indeed a fact that today the world spends 60 times more money to teach a soldier the ABCs of annihilation than to teach a child the science of creation. And, if one goes through the records of some parliaments, it would appear there is no greater evil than a reduction of military spending. As a result, record-breaking military budgets are being adopted. Those who work at the factory bench and in the fields or who are engaged in scientific and cultural activities are increasingly deprived of funds that could be used for improving nutrition, public health, education, housing and social security.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"159.	Science and technology have made tremendous strides forward. Opportunities for raising the material and cultural standards of the people have increased immeasurably. But a huge proportion of the material and intellectual resources of the world are being devoured by the arms race. According to United Nations data, the world today spends on armaments about $300 billion a year, or more than a million dollars every two minutes. In the three hours of this very plenary meeting we are attending, another $90 million worth of means of destruction will have been added to the total.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"160.	And what are we to say about the arguments -which have been elevated almost to the rank of theories -of those who preach, with criminal neglect of human life and the achievements of civilization, that it is better to build man's future on radio-active ashes?",UNGD
RUS,1976,"161.	We shall not now go into an analysis of the causes of the arms race or their social nature, although of course we could certainly find a few things to say about this too. Now, here in this hall, where States with different social systems are represented, we should focus our attention on what concerns us all equally: the prevention of war and the consolidation of peace.",UNGD
RUS,1976,162.	The Soviet Union rejects the grim conclusion that putting an end to the arms race is beyond human ability. No one can prove that people must either constantly be at war or be preparing for mutual annihilation.,UNGD
RUS,1976,"163.	For almost six decades now our country has been guided in its policies by ideas of a different kind, those of peace and friendship among nations. Lenin, the founder of the Soviet State, said, ""An end to wars, peace among nations, an end to plundering and violence-that is our ideal..."".",UNGD
RUS,1976,"164.	The Soviet Union acts in the international arena in close unity and co-operation with its allies and friends, the fraternal socialist States. We are proud that the impact of the socialist countries on the course of world affairs is becoming ever more profound, and we are proud because that impact is used not only in the interests of those States but also for purposes of strengthening universal peace.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"165.	Any objective observer can realize that the members of the Warsaw Pact, the countries of the socialist community, bring to international politics a feeling of respect for the independence and sovereignty of all nations and put forward concrete peace-loving initiatives and proposals and serve as a reliable bulwark for peoples fighting for national liberation and social progress.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"166.	The Leninist ideas of peace found new, vivid expression in the decisions of the highest forum of our Party, the Twenty-fifth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, held last spring. Its program of further struggle for peace and international co-operation and for the freedom and independence of the peoples, set out in the report delivered by Leonid Brezhnev, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, is imbued with a sense of profound optimism and an unshakable belief in the possibility of making peace on earth enduring.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"167.	As one of the major objectives of the Soviet Union's foreign policy, the Twenty-fifth Congress set the task of seeking to contain the arms race, and then to reverse the trend and begin disarmament. We have put forward numerous specific proposals. Some of them are long-term proposals; others, with goodwill on the part of our partners too, could be implemented in the near future.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"168.	Now, what specifically do we have in mind?",UNGD
RUS,1976,"169.	The first step would be the curbing of a further build-up of weapons of mass destruction, to be followed by their complete prohibition and elimination. The conscience of mankind demands that ultimately nuclear weapons be eliminated altogether.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"170.	The Soviet Union has been, and remains, in favor of the removal of nuclear weapons from the arsenals of States, and of using nuclear energy solely for peaceful purposes. We believe that the nuclear Powers-and all other States could join them-should come to the negotiating table to examine comprehensively the problem of nuclear disarmament and to chart together ways leading to its solution. The Soviet Union is prepared to take part in such negotiations at any time.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"171.	Independently of these negotiations, nuclear- weapons testing should be stopped everywhere and by all. This would put an end to the qualitative improvement of those weapons. That is the purpose of the proposal to conclude a treaty on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear weapons testing approved by the General Assembly at its last session [resolution 3466 (XXX)]. The start of negotiations on this question is being unjustifiably delayed. The problem here is not the absence of objective conditions -they have long existed-but the unwillingness of some nuclear Powers to begin negotiations.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"172.	The question of underground nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes cannot be allowed to become a stumbling-block: the USSR and the United States have, after all, succeeded in agreeing on this matter, and have recently signed a relevant Treaty.1 2 We hope that this Treaty will soon be ratified by the United States. On our part, there will be no delay.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"173.	The problem of verification has been artificially inflated for quite some time now. Advanced techniques for identifying seismic phenomena have eliminated this point of disagreement as well. If, nevertheless, there are some who still harbor doubts on this score, we are confident that a mutually acceptable approach can be found that would remove such doubts.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"174.	In short, no room has been left for any plausible excuses which would prevent the completion of the task of prohibiting all nuclear weapons tests.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"175.	It is a matter of growing concern that channels for the proliferation of nuclear weapons have not yet been fully blocked. One can only imagine how much greater the risk of nuclear war would become if new States, particularly those in conflict with each other, became involved in the process of developing and stockpiling nuclear weapons.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"176.	It is well known that at present international commercial exchanges of nuclear materials are increasing. In some cases, however, it is not sufficiently certain that the possession of fissionable materials could not be used for dangerous purposes or that the means of developing nuclear weapons would not fall into the hands of irresponsible persons, adventurists, or simply madmen. This is not a question of trade, but of politics and security.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"12 Treaty on Underground Nuclear Explosions for Peaceful Purposes, signed at Washington and Moscow on 28 May 1976 (see document A/31/125).",UNGD
RUS,1976,"177.	Surely it follows that the world must be safely protected from all such risks. The way to achieve this is to strengthen the regime on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. We should redouble our efforts to make the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex] truly universal and to secure the accession to it of all States, without exception.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"178.	The Soviet Union proposes that all chemical means of warfare be completely prohibited and destroyed, as has been done in respect of bacteriological weapons. If all States are not prepared to take such a step, then, to begin with, agreement should be reached on banning and eliminating the most dangerous and lethal types of chemical weapons.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"179.	It is not only the means of mass destruction already accumulated that pose a threat: potentially, weapons based on qualitatively new operating principles, in terms of methods of use, targets or effects, could become just as formidable. Today such weapons may exist only as blueprints, mock-ups or ideas, but experience shows that their appearance may not be too far away.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"180.	At the last session of the General Assembly, the Soviet Union proposed the conclusion of an international agreement which would preclude the development and production of new types and new systems of weapons of mass destruction,  Some have asked how you can prohibit something that does not yet exist. However, since the very beginning of the discussion of this matter in the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva, it has become evident that there is here a subject for serious discussion. It is vastly more difficult to agree on the elimination of those types of weapons which have already been supplied to armies. The Soviet Union believes that everything possible must be done to prevent the development of new types and systems of weapons of mass destruction.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"181.	Conventional types of weapons are not normally included among weapons of mass annihilation. But modern tanks, aircraft, cannon and even small arms have been perfected to such a degree that they have actually become instruments capable of wiping out great masses of people.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"182.	Since the Second World War, the Soviet Union has repeatedly proposed that conventional types of arms and the strength of armed forces also be reduced. We believe it imperative to discuss these questions as well.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"183.	As it always has, the Soviet Union favors the dismantling of all foreign military bases on alien territories. The existence of such bases is one of the main causes of the complications and tensions in the world. This problem is no less urgent today than it was yesterday.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"184.	To open up ever new avenues towards the solution of the disarmament problem, efforts are required along many lines. In some cases, the desired result is brought closer by singling out as a subject for negotiation certain types of weapon-say, strategic nuclear missiles. In other cases, the consideration of some particular aspect of the curbing of the arms race in the context of a certain region of the globe is more promising. The Soviet Union is in favor of using either of these approaches, or of combining them when circumstances permit. That also determines the attitude of our country towards regional measures of military detente, including the possibility of creating zones of peace or nuclear-free zones.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"185.	We consider it reasonable that a number of Asian and African States desire to turn the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace. In this connexion, the essential point is that there should be no foreign military bases in the area which constitute the main element of a permanent military presence. As for the Soviet Union, it has never had and does not have any intention of building military bases in the Indian Ocean.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"186.	In solving the problem of foreign military bases along these lines, the Soviet Union is prepared, together with other Powers, to seek ways of reducing on a reciprocal basis the military activities of non-coastal States in the Indian Ocean and the regions directly adjacent thereto. Our country has shown its readiness to contribute to the realization of the idea of turning the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace, but of course, this should not create any obstacles to freedom of navigation or scientific research in that Ocean. If due account is taken of our approach by the States concerned, the Soviet Union will be able to participate in consultations on matters relating to preparations for convening an international conference on the Indian Ocean.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"187.	Among the various methods of securing the curtailment of the arms race there is another one which, as it were, combines the various possibilities, and that is the reduction of military budgets.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"188.	Three years ago, the General Assembly approved our proposal that the military budgets of States permanent members of the Security Council be reduced by 10 per cent while a part of the money thus saved could be used to provide assistance to developing countries [resolution 3254 (XXIX)]. Because of the position taken by some States, the practical solution of this problem has been blocked. Wishing to break the deadlock in this matter, we are prepared to look for mutually acceptable specific figures with which the reduction could be started. As a first step, a figure either greater or smaller than 10 per cent could be agreed upon as soon as for 1977, next year. But it is necessary to begin negotiations on this question.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"189.	The opponents of reductions of military budgets are resorting to every possible means to frustrate any agreement about this. They are endeavoring to prove that inflated military budgets are necessary in the interests of peace, higher employment in industry and the reinforcement of negotiating positions, primarily in negotiations with the Soviet Union. All these arguments are illusory. Those who use them are well aware that they are turning the truth and standing it on its head. But, of course, they do not want to tell the truth. Those who base their policy not on deceiving people but on revealing to them the true causes of such an international phenomenon as an uncontrolled arms race cannot reconcile themselves to that, and they even feel it necessary to say so from this lofty rostrum of the United Nations.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"190.	So far, the pace of the arms race has far outstripped the efforts of States to arrest it, and this gap is growing. It is time, and everything possible must be done not only to narrow this gap and even to eliminate it totally, but also to ensure that disarmament negotiations outstrip the arms race in terms of effectiveness, thereby facilitating its termination. The Soviet Union continues to believe that if the elimination of one type of weapon cannot be immediately agreed upon then, to begin with, its production should be substantially limited. But in any case, the important thing is to make a start.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"191.	No one today will deny that the arms race has assumed unprecedented dimensions. This makes it imperative for all States, nuclear and non-nuclear, great and small, developed and developing, to combine their efforts to arrest it.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"192.	That is why the Soviet Union has proposed, and continues to propose, that the problem of disarmament be considered in its entirety at the broadest and most authoritative forum-a world disarmament conference. An overwhelming majority of the States of the world have declared themselves in favor of convening such a conference. But the implementation of this proposal continues to meet with the objections of some big Powers.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"193.	In this regard it has been suggested that it would be appropriate to hold a special session of the General Assembly to discuss disarmament questions. Well, this, too, is a suitable forum if it is viewed as an intermediate stage in the preparations for a world conference. But it must really be a special kind of session, not a routine one. We see its task as that of paving the way for a world conference and finally ensuring a real break-through in solving disarmament problems. Its work must reflect the grave responsibility of all States of the world, especially the great Powers.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"194.	Such, fundamentally, is our approach to the problem of stopping the arms race and of disarmament. Such is the essence of the Soviet Union's memorandum on these questions which we are submitting for consideration at this session and circulating as an official document of the United Nations [A/31/232],",UNGD
RUS,1976,"195.	Some of the provisions of the memorandum have already been proposed earlier by us, and others have been put forward for the first time. I should like to express the confidence that this important document will be viewed by States Members of the United Nations as reflecting the sincere efforts of the Soviet Union, of our people, to help banish the threat of a world war of annihilation.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"196.	Neither in the years preceding the Second World War nor in the first few post-war decades did there exist the objective conditions for making progress towards ending the arms race and towards disarmament such as those that exist today. It will be recalled that it has recently proved possible to achieve international understandings which impose certain limits on the arms race in some areas. As far as one can judge, an important agreement on the prohibition of military or any other hostile use of environmental modification techniques seems to be within reach. A number of questions relating to disarmament are now being discussed among States.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"197.	Pride of place belongs, for obvious reasons, to the continuing talks between the Soviet Union and the United States of America on strategic arms limitation. The importance of these talks far transcends the interests of just our two countries. We are ready actively to continue our efforts to translate the well-known Vladivostok understanding into the text of an agreement.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"198.	There can hardly be anyone who would doubt that the fullest guarantees of peace will be provided by general and complete disarmament. Ever since Lenin's days, Soviet foreign policy has been aimed at achieving that ultimate goal.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"199.	But along with efforts to solve that historic task, it is possible and necessary to seek by other means, too, a reduction of the risk of the outbreak of war. Now, what is of decisive importance today? Above all, a firm agreement between States not to use force in international relations.",UNGD
RUS,1976,200.	It could be argued that the principle of the renunciation of the use or threat of force is already embodied in the United Nations Charter. This is true. But it is also true that many States are seeking ways of putting this principle into practice. It is no accident that it was considered necessary to lay special emphasis on it in recent bilateral and multilateral international treaties and agreements.,UNGD
RUS,1976,"201.	The principle of the non-use of force has been developed in detail in the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. The need to abide strictly by this principle has on more than one occasion been stressed by non-aligned States, and particularly at their highest forums.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"202.	There is another important consideration. When the Charter of the United Nations was being signed, nuclear weapons were virtually non-existent. Their emergence-and especially their growth into a huge complex of various kinds and types of weapon-is a qualitatively new factor. It radically changes our concepts of the consequences of armed conflict. Therefore, it was not without reason that the General Assembly of the United Nations in its special resolution adopted in 1972 linked renunciation of the use of force with the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons [resolution 2936 (XXVII)]. Thus, the question of how States should deal with each other without seriously endangering the security of the peoples of the world has not become a whit less urgent.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"203.	There are certainly enough unresolved problems in today's world. They were bequeathed to us by the Second World War and the period of the ""cold war"", and they continue to arise now and again in the course of the current development of international relations.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"204.	These knots of differences among States should be untied and outstanding problems should be resolved at the conference table, by peaceful means. The principle of renunciation of the use of force must become an iron law of international affairs. That is the purpose of the proposal made from the rostrum of the Twenty-fifth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union concerning the concluding of a world treaty on the non-use of force in international relations.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"205.	We note with satisfaction that that proposal has met with a broad response and has aroused the interest of many States. At the same time, we are asked what the Soviet Union has in mind in terms of the specific contents of such a treaty.",UNGD
RUS,1976,206.	The answer to this question is to be found in the draft world treaty on the non-use of force in international relations which the Soviet Union is submitting to the General Assembly [A/311243].,UNGD
RUS,1976,"207.	The essence of the proposed treaty lies in the idea that in their relations with each other, as well as in their international relations in general, all parties to it will strictly abide by the undertaking to refrain from the use or threat of force either against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"208.	They will accordingly refrain from the use of armed forces involving the employment of any types of weapon, including nuclear weapons, on land, at sea, in the air and in outer space and will not threaten to use such forces.",UNGD
RUS,1976,209.	They will have to reaffirm the undertaking to settle disputes among themselves solely by peaceful means in such a way as not to endanger international peace and security.,UNGD
RUS,1976,"210.	There is, of course, a fundamental difference between the launching of hostilities for the purposes of aggression and the legitimate right to repel aggression or eliminate its consequences. Can the Arabs, for instance, resign themselves to the loss of their lands? And do the colonial peoples have no right to fight for their independence till final victory? They do indeed have an inalienable right to that.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"211.	The substance of the matter is the prevention of aggression. In this case there will be no further need to use force to repel it. The source of the evil is aggression and not the desire to restore justice; that is the cause and not its effect. Underlying our draft treaty -and I want to lay special emphasis on this -is the definition of aggression worked out by the United Nations, and everyone voted in favor of that document [resolution 3314 (XXIX)].",UNGD
RUS,1976,212.	The treaty takes fully into account the system of bilateral and multilateral relations of States that has developed in the world. One of its articles provides that nothing in the treaty affects the rights and obligations of States under the United Nations Charter and treaties and agreements concluded by them earlier.,UNGD
RUS,1976,"213.	It is envisaged that the treaty would be open for signature by any State of the world at any time. This means that, first, it would be of a general, universal nature. Secondly, for the signatory States the treaty would enter into force upon ratification. Consequently, there would be no need to wait for the accession to the treaty of a specific number of countries.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"214.	According to our draft, the Secretary-General of the United Nations would be the depository of the treaty. The United Nations as a whole would be called upon to lend all its moral and political prestige in support of the treaty.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"215.	The conclusion of the treaty we are proposing would be a major step bringing the world closer to the time when it will prove possible to eliminate entirely the threat of war and aggression. Supplementing and reinforcing the provisions concerning the non-use of force contained in various international instruments, the treaty would offer new and more reliable guarantees of security to all countries, big and small, and strengthen their confidence that their peaceful life would not be disrupted.",UNGD
RUS,1976,216.	The treaty would undoubtedly also expedite the implementation of effective disarmament measures. The draft clearly provides that the parties will make all the necessary efforts to that end.,UNGD
RUS,1976,217.	Whose rights and interests would be infringed by such a treaty? Who would fail to benefit from it? Every State that really wants peace and international co-operation would stand to gain from it. The conclusion of such a treaty would be of benefit to peace throughout the world.,UNGD
RUS,1976,218.	The Soviet Union hopes that the General Assembly will thoroughly consider the proposal to conclude a world treaty on the non-use of force in international relations and declare itself in favor of it.,UNGD
RUS,1976,219.	These are the new and concrete initiatives designed to stop the arms race and exclude the use of force in relations among States which have been proposed by the Soviet Union in this important forum. We are convinced that the fundamental strengthening of the bulwark of universal peace depends to a decisive degree on progress precisely in those two directions. The political climate in the world and the processes of relaxation of international tension prevailing in it are conducive to an undertaking of the implementation of these initiatives in a practical and serious manner.,UNGD
RUS,1976,220.	The relaxation of tension and the attitude of States towards it are now in the searchlight of world politics. This alone shows that detente is not a myth or a catchword. Underlying it is a real change-over from confrontation and brinkmanship to peaceful and mutually beneficial co-operation among States and the investing of such co-operation with ever greater material content.,UNGD
RUS,1976,"221.	Not a single State, not a single Government-if, of course, it really wishes to remain in touch with reality should hesitate in choosing its policy: either to promote the further reduction of tension and the elimination of the remnants of the cold war or to kindle conflict and friction. Every Government, every statesman should consider it an honor to be in the mainstream of the forces working for the further reduction of tension in the world.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"222.	Statesmen who are directly responsible for the foreign policy of their countries should be imbued with the awareness that the course towards solving international problems, including the most urgent and complicated ones, through negotiations -and negotiations alone- equally serves the interests of all peoples and all States. And if that is so, then is it permissible to favor detente today and oppose it tomorrow? Is is permissible, while talking about one's desire to improve relations among States, particularly among the major Powers, at the same time in actual fact to follow in the wake of those who in major politics see no further than the buttons on their military tunics? To invoke in this regard some kind of considerations of domestic policy means to regard detente as the mere small change of political dealings, and not as a firm and noble guideline for ensuring peace,",UNGD
RUS,1976,"223.	Some attempts have also been made to interpret detente as if it almost amounted to sanctioning interference in the domestic affairs of other States. How else can one describe the false solicitude of certain people for the rights of citizens in other countries? In actual fact these people are extolling those renegades who believe that the laws of their own country were not written for them to obey. Those who display such touching solicitude for them should open their eyes and take a good look at themselves and around them and see how matters stand in their own house in so far as real, not imaginary, human rights violations are concerned.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"224.	We believe that the foreign policy of States in matters relating to peace should be determined and pursued consistently and in good faith. We welcome statements precisely in favor of such a policy from the rostrum of this world Organization. As for the Soviet Union, its position has been determined with utmost clarity by the decisions of the Twenty-fifth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Expressing the will of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, of the entire Soviet people, Leonid Brezhnev has stated that our country would",UNGD
RUS,1976,"""...do everything possible to deepen international detente and to embody it in concrete forms of mutually beneficial co-operation between States,""",UNGD
RUS,1976,"That is our firm foreign policy line, one which the Soviet Union will steadfastly follow.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"225.	Experience has shown that if States, no matter how different, take account of reality and exert their will for the same goal-the strengthening of peace- the results are impressive. Europe is a compelling example of that. The year that has passed since the conclusion of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe shows that the development of the situation there is, on the whole, marked by a realization of the understanding approved at Helsinki.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"226.	There are, however, some who are not averse to grumbling. There are various things in the Final Act of the all-European Conference which are not to their liking. We also could point out quite a number of provisions which do not go as far as we would like. But what has been accepted by all the participants and solemnly sealed by the signatures of the leaders of States should be implemented-and implemented fully. That naturally applies also to the clauses relating to the inadmissibility of outside interference in the domestic affairs of States. That is how the Soviet Union acts and intends to act.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"227.	Of course, this is not only a question of the Helsinki decisions. All the treaties and agreements concluded in recent years in the interests of a peaceful future for Europe should be scrupulously observed by all parties. I should like to emphasize particularly that attempts to undercut the Quadripartite Agreement on West Berlin, which has been serving the cause of improving the situation in the center of the European continent for five years now, run counter to these interests.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"228.	In the light of the results of the all-European Conference new possibilities have opened up for expanding relations between States in Europe in the political, economic, scientific and technological fields, as well as in the sphere of culture, contacts, information and education. The Soviet Union has put forward concrete proposals for organizing multilateral co-operation in such important fields as energy production, transport and protection of the environment.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"229.	The task of supplementing political detente with military detente is now coming to the fore in European affairs. What does that mean primarily? It means a successful conclusion of the Vienna talks on mutual reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe, where the concentration of armed forces and armaments is higher than in any other part of the world.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"230.	The Soviet Union and other socialist countries taking part in the negotiations are seeking to make the discussions constructive. We have given figures with regard to the total strength of the armed forces of the Warsaw Treaty countries stationed in the zone of reductions, including land forces. It is now our partners' turn to respond. If no attempts are made to obtain unilateral military advantages, the negotiations in Vienna will also succeed.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"231.	It is well known how important for the international situation is the state of Soviet-American relations. As a result of the agreements and understandings reached between the USSR and the United States of America in previous years, the necessary conditions have been created for continuing to build those relations on a constructive foundation.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"232.	So far as concerns the Soviet Union, it is not guided in its policy by temporary considerations of the moment. The true interests of both countries and the interests of peace are served by only one course of action-that of acting in conformity, with a course jointly formulated in recent years, with the spirit and letter of the agreements that have been concluded. The Soviet Union expects that the United States will proceed precisely in that way. That will primarily determine further developments.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"233.	Relations between the Soviet Union and France are developing in a favorable direction. This is something which has been reflected in the signing of many agreements, including the Declaration on the further development of friendship and co-operation, singed last October. The recent Soviet-French agreement to prevent the accidental or unauthorized use of nuclear weapons  is along the same lines. In so far as concerns the Soviet Union, we will consistently follow the line we have taken in our relations with France.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"234.	A great deal of what has been achieved in relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany and, above all, the conclusion of the Moscow Treaty between the two States on 12 August 1970, has marked the end of a whole phase in the post-war history of Europe. A fundamentally important page was turned in the right direction. The Soviet Union believes that further development and deepening of co-operation with the Federal Republic of Germany-in the expectation, naturally, that the policy of that country will be determined by the interests of peace, including the interests of peaceful development and good neighborliness in Europe is desirable.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"235.	The relations between the Soviet Union and practically all States which are known as ""Western""-Great Britain or Denmark, Italy or Belgium, Canada or Sweden- are increasingly assuming the character of normal, mutually advantageous co-operation.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"236.	The successes of the policy of detente by no means signify that it no longer has any opponents. Ill-assorted forces often presenting a common front against it are easily found in Europe and elsewhere-in fact, they reveal themselves every day.",UNGD
RUS,1976,,UNGD
RUS,1976,"231. The fruits of the policy of detente must be accessible to all peoples. It is well known, however, that the independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus are still threatened. Tensions in the Middle East have not abated.",UNGD

RUS,1976,"239.	It is now common knowledge that thousands of people have been killed or crippled in Lebanon in recent months. The tragic events which have occurred in that country are the direct result of imperialist aggression against the Arabs. The events in Lebanon are a direct consequence of the lack of an overall settlement in the Middle East. The blow is being aimed primarily against the patriots of Lebanon and the valiant Arab people of Palestine, whose just struggle cannot but evoke our admiration.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"240.	The Soviet Union believes that the crisis in Lebanon must be settled in a peaceful, democratic way by the Lebanese themselves, without any outside interference, on the basis of the preservation of the territorial integrity, independence and sovereignty of Lebanon.",UNGD
RUS,1976,241.	The protracted nature of the tension in the Middle East gives us no grounds for concluding that the situation there is hopeless. A good basis for establishing peace in that area has been worked out through the efforts of many,UNGD
RUS,1976,"States, including the Soviet Union. What it boils down to is: the withdrawal of Israeli troops from all Arab territories occupied in 1967; the satisfaction of the legitimate national demands of the Arab people of Palestine, including their inalienable right to create their own State; and the furnishing of international security guarantees for all States in the Middle East, including Israel.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"242.	Is there anything here that could fail to be to anyone's liking, provided that there is a real intention to live in peace with one's neighbors?",UNGD
RUS,1976,"243.	Unfortunately, the international machinery for producing the necessary agreements on the Middle East-the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East-is still inactive. The Soviet Union is in favor of a resumption of its work, and the sooner the better, for a consideration by it of all the major issues involved in a Middle East settlement—I repeat, all the major issues involved in such a settlement.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"244.	It is becoming ever more urgent to spread detente to Asia. Conditions are ripening there for tire consolidation of peace through the joint efforts of the Asian States. This is demonstrated by a fact of vast historical significance- the end of the war in IndoChina and the formation of a new major peace-loving State, the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. The Soviet Union is confident that the voice of an independent, united Vietnam will soon be heard from this rostrum too. We insist that the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam be admitted to the United Nations without delay.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"245.	Friendly co-operation between the Soviet Union and India is an important stabilizing factor in the Asian continent. Mutual understanding and confidence between the two States were vividly manifested once again during the recent visit to the Soviet Union of Mrs. Indira Gandhi, the Prime Minister of the Republic of India.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"246.	Along with the trend towards an improvement of the situation in Asia, there are other facts. In that part of the world, too, circles are active which are by no means loath to create tension by stepping up military preparations, particularly in the area bordering on the southern frontiers of the Soviet Union. History knows how such efforts have ended and this should not be forgotten.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"247.	The question of the withdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea should be finally resolved. We support the proposals of the Korean Democratic People's Republic for the peaceful reunification of Korea without outside interference. As we know, last year's session of the General Assembly adopted a resolution in this regard [resolution 3390 (XXX)] on the creation of favorable conditions for converting the armistice in Korea into a lasting peace and for expediting the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea. That resolution should be put into effect.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"248.	The Soviet Union continues, as it has done in the past, to attach great importance to its relations with the People's Republic of China. The normalization of those relations would undoubtedly have a positive effect on the situation in Asia, and, indeed, have even wider international repercussions. Our position in this respect as regards the People's Republic of China has been made quite clear by the decisions of the Twenty-fifth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and that position is fully valid today.",UNGD
RUS,1976,249.	The situation in the south of Africa is a subject requiring the most serious attention. The rulers of the Republic of South Africa and of Southern Rhodesia and all those who support and arm them are now demonstrating and would have us believe that they have resigned themselves to the inevitability of the process of national liberation and that they are trying to adapt themselves to it.,UNGD
RUS,1976,"250.	But in actual fact everything possible is still being done to repress the just struggle of the peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia and of the indigenous people of the Republic of South Africa for their legitimate rights and for an end to the hateful policy of racism. Every possible method is being resorted to, from direct suppression and violence to attempts to divert the national liberation movement from genuine independence and freedom through political gimmickry and financial hand-outs.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"251.	What is being sought from these people before the eyes of the whole world? A renunciation of their inalienable right to free and independent development, a development along the path of social progress. But we are confident that the inexorable course of events and the facts of life itself with its political realities will put everything in its proper perspective. Peoples have learned and have learned well to distinguish between truth and falsehood.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"252.	Today, as always, the Soviet Union stands firmly by the side of the fighting peoples of southern Africa. We are in favor of the unconditional ending of the policy of apartheid and racism in South Africa, of the immediate withdrawal of South Africa from Namibia, of the unreserved transfer of all power to the people of Zimbabwe. No one will ever see the Soviet Union failing to oppose attempts to prolong colonial and racist oppression under whatever guise.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"253.	It is worth recalling, particularly in this hall, that on 14 December 1960 thunderous applause greeted the adoption of the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)]. Its adoption signified that historically the hour had struck for the complete elimination of colonial domination in the world.",UNGD

Thousands of miles separate the Soviet Union from Latin America, but our people have feelings of friendship towards its peoples and wish to have good relations with Latin American countries. So much greater, then, are our bitterness and indignation at tHe unabated violations of human rights and liberties in several parts of that continent, primarily in Chile, where these rights and freedoms are being flagrantly and criminally trampled under foot. Together with all progressive mankind we demand freedom for Luis Corvalan, arrested three years ago, and for other Chilean democrats.",UNGD

We support the just demands of the developing countries to do away with discrimination and artificial barriers in international trade, to eliminate all instances of inequality, the imposition of will and exploitation in international economic relations. On behalf of the Soviet Union, the Soviet delegation intends to make a special statement on these matters at this session of the General Assembly.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"258.	Among topical issues of international affairs a prominent place now belongs to questions relating to the co-operation of States in the uses of the world's oceans. A search for ways of establishing such co-operation is, as we know, under way at the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, the latest round of which came to an end just a few days ago, The Soviet Union believes that the issues facing that Conference should be resolved by its participants on a mutually acceptable basis. No one should try to impose on the Conference any arbitrary or one-sided decisions which have nothing in common with the interests of justice and the fruitful co-operation of States in such an important field as the use of the world's oceans.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"259.	The present international situation is far from being monochrome. Along with the positive changes which have occurred in the world, which have been characteristic of recent times, certain phenomena of a different kind have been noted, namely, opposition to detente. This requires the vigilance and active efforts of all those who cherish the cause of peace. And yet the overall political background of the world today gives grounds for looking to the future with optimism,",UNGD
RUS,1976,"260.	The States of the socialist community have thrown their prestige, their material and foreign policy resources onto the scales of the policy of defending peace. The newly independent countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America have resolutely favored the strengthening of international security. This has also been demonstrated by the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries in Colombo.",UNGD
RUS,1976,"261.	A sound tendency is emerging in the policy of a number of capitalist States and gathering momentum, although not without snags.

RUS,1976,"262. We are convinced that, in the light of present-day dynamics of the correlation of forces in the world, with detente making ever more confident headway, the United Nations should exploit all its possibilities as a reliable instrument for maintaining and strengthening peace.

But what matters most is that the constant influx of new Members adds to the political weight and capabilities of the United Nations and enhances the over-all potential of the policy of peace.

RUS,1977,"111. The same objectives are served by concrete foreign policy actions of the Soviet Union, by the initiatives which we take in international affairs. Many of them have been enunciated from this very rostrum.

RUS,1977,"113.	But is it not true that the work for a stronger peace is no less pressing today than it was yesterday? Indeed, it has proved possible in recent years to make headway in this direction. In various parts of the planet people have felt tangibly that it is easier to breathe, that the threat of war is receding. The process of detente is becoming pivotal to the development of international relations. But it is clear that in the current situation with its pluses and minuses intricately intertwined this process is not yet immune from delays or even reverses.",UNGD
RUS,1977,114.	One cannot fail to notice that there are still forces at work in the world which do not find detente to their liking. And to say this is perhaps to put it too mildly if one takes into account how fiercely they are attacking the policy of detente.,UNGD
RUS,1977,"115.	Faced with a clear prospect of improvement of the international climate, certain groups are intensifying their attempts to launch an offensive to push the world back to the times of the  cold war . Those groups have a stake in an unrestrained arms race, the preservation of old centers of tensions and the creation of new ones, and the perpetuation of the remnants of colonialism and racism.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"116.	As a matter of fact we are confronted with the following alternative: either the world will follow the road of renouncing the use of force, the road of disarmament and equal, mutually beneficial co-operation, or it may plunge even more deeply into the arms race and find itself on the brink of a nuclear catastrophe. That is why our country is laying such stress on the need to continue and consolidate detente.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"117.	One hears it said at times:  You know, detente is an abstract thing; nobody really knows what it is all about.  Such an argument is spurious and far-fetched. But if it is really necessary to clarify the meaning which the USSR gives to the concept of a relaxation of tensions, this has been done most authoritatively by the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, President of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Leonid I. Brezhnev. He said in his speech in the city of Tula last January:",UNGD
RUS,1977," Detente means, first of all the overcoming of the 'cold war' and transition to normal, stable relations among",UNGD
RUS,1977,"States; detente means willingness to resolve differences and disputes not by force, not by threats or sabre-rattling, but by peaceful means, at the conference table. Detente means a certain trust and ability to take into consideration each other's legitimate interests. ",UNGD
RUS,1977,"118.	Is there really anything recondite in this definition or indeed anything that could provoke objections from those who truly aspire to peace? No, there is nothing of that kind nor can. there possibly be. All this is exactly what each country should be guided by in its policy when facing the countless variety of problems posed by international life. We note with satisfaction that an - increasing number of responsible statesmen are coming to the conclusion that in a nuclear age there is no reasonable alternative to the policy of detente and peaceful coexistence.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"119.	The experience of recent years has shown that when States are inspired by peaceful strivings, in actual deeds and not just in words, they do find a common language in settling on actions that lead to a stronger peace. Moreover, not only do they find it, they also work quite successfully—jointly or along parallel courses—to attain this goal.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"120.	Indeed, the very improvement of the international climate in recent years has become possible because this was the common cause for a sizable number of countries and for political and social forces which in their world outlook and ideology often stand quite far apart but are none the less willing to co-operate for the benefit of peace.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"121.	The policy of detente cannot be allowed to mark time, still less to take a downward turn. It must be constantly nourished with new initiatives and brought within the reach of an ever greater number of States; in short, we must ensure what one may call the materialization of detente.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"122.	The United Nations has a weighty role in this respect also. All States Members of the United Nations, no matter how diverse their positions and views, are called upon to step up their efforts to deepen and strengthen detente.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"123.	In the conditions now shaping up in the international arena, we consider it extremely important that the United Nations and all its Member States solemnly declare their commitment to detente and use all their authority to back it up. This directly follows from the obligation to live together in peace with one another which the States Members of the United Nations assumed under the Charter.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"124.	If the States Members of the United Nations jointly express their political will and determination to advance the cause of detente, this will contribute to overcoming the obstacles which arise in the path of this process and to the over-all improvement of the political climate in the world. In so doing the General Assembly could determine, in terms of the present-day situation, the top priority areas in which States could exert peaceful efforts and the line of conduct which they should follow in relations with each other.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"125.	What, specifically, do we have in mind?",UNGD
RUS,1977,"126.	It is necessary, above all, scrupulously to protect the assets of detente that have already been accumulated and to prevent them from being squandered. And these assets accumulated in recent years are quite impressive. It is necessary to assist actively in the implementation of multilateral treaties and agreements which serve the interests of strengthening international security and developing peaceful relations, as well as of United Nations decisions aimed at reaching these goals. And a good many such decisions have indeed been adopted.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"127.	Another appropriate channel for directing efforts to the benefit of peace and peaceful relations among States is, of course, that of taking resolute steps to contain the arms race and to turn the course of events towards disarmament. What words can be found to make those responsible for the policies of their States realize the imperative need to act seriously in this area?",UNGD
RUS,1977,"128.	In the post-war period the arms race has been spiralling upwards continuously, but we were not the ones to cause this. This race was forced on the world by others. However, at every stage the Soviet Union proposed, backing its proposals up with concrete deeds, that an end be put to the dangerous competition and that funds be diverted to the noble endeavour of improving conditions of life for the peoples of the world. And that is still our position.",UNGD
RUS,1977,129.	The Soviet proposals in the field of disarmament are well known. At the last session of the General Assembly we submitted them again in a summarized form in the memorandum of the Soviet Union on questions of ending the arms race and on disarmament. It emphasizes our willingness to search for new measures in the field of disarmament as well as to advance towards general and complete disarmament.,UNGD
RUS,1977,"130.	We do not in the least underestimate the significance of some constraints placed on the arms race in a number of areas in recent years. The Soviet Union has made its contribution, together with other countries, in the preparation and implementation of a whole series of relevant international treaties and agreements. These either curtail the build-up of certain types of weapons or ban the arms race in certain environments. The latest example of this is the signing of the Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques. In our view, all States without exception should accede to it if they want to support by deeds their words about peace.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"131.	None the less, in realistic terms very little has been done so far Actually, physical disarmament and the elimination of the material means of warfare have not even been started yet. The armies of States have not been reduced by a single aircraft or a single tank as called for in United Nations resolutions. How many good and excellent concrete proposals failed to materialize because of overt or covert sabotage by those who would not even hear of disarmament? Will they ever give thought to where they are pushing the world by incessantly whipping up war production and the arms race?",UNGD
RUS,1977,"132.	If one listens to the pronouncements of certain statesmen, one might even get the impression that they appear to be in favour of putting an end to tills. But what, I ask, is the actual state of affairs?",UNGD
RUS,1977,"133.	A closer look at what are sometimes proposed as  comprehensive  disarmament recipes would reveal that the objectives pursued are diametrically opposed to those of reaching agreements. It would seem that the intent here is roughly as follows: what about making a proposal known in advance to be unacceptable to our counterpart? He then will reject it, thereby giving us a convenient excuse, first, to blame him for that and, secondly, by invoking his rejection, to take steps to build up armaments which, in the absence of such camouflage, would appear quite unseemly.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"134.	Can one really on the one hand propose various  drastic reductions  while on the other hand authorizing the development of new and, bluntly speaking, merciless, terrifying types of weapons such as the neutron bomb? No wonder the world literally shuddered when it learned of the secret programmes to manufacture that weapon. How can one qualify this inhuman weapon as  humane ? After all, it is intended to be used directly against human beings and is in the same category as such cruel and barbaric means of warfare as bacteriological or chemical weapons. In our view, the United Nations must resolutely demand that the plans for the production of new types and systems of weapons of mass destruction, including the neutron bomb, should be discontinued.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"135.	It becomes increasingly evident with each passing day that the achievement of concrete results in the field of disarmament requires the mobilization of the efforts of. all States of the world. The United Nations has a special responsibility in this regard. It must be acknowledged that the United Nations does not stand aloof as regards the disarmament problem. It has adopted a whole number of meaningful resolutions on that score. They are said to be recommendations, but if such recommendations express the will of the peoples for disarmament, it is then the duty of all Governments to be guided by them in their practical action.",UNGD
RUS,1977,136.	A special session of the United Nations General Assembly on disarmament is to be convened next year. We shall not merely have to conduct there a wide exchange of views on fundamental approaches to the disarmament problem at. the present stage but we shall also have jointly to identify the main areas where States should concentrate their priority efforts in the field of disarmament. The Soviet Union would like that session to be business-like and to help with practical preparations for a successful convening in the immediate future of a World Disarmament Conference.,UNGD
RUS,1977,"137.	Next, efforts in favour of detente presuppose such actions by States as would contribute to an early peaceful settlement of situations of conflict and to the preclusion of new situations of that kind from arising.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"138.	Acting in conformity with the decisions of the Twenty-fifth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, our country continues actively to press for the elimination of the remaining hotbeds of war. Of course, the most dangerous of those is the one in the Middle East. Why is there no durable peace in that region? Simply because the principal causes of the conflict have .not been removed. Israeli troops have not been withdrawn from the Arab lands seized in 1967. The right of the Arab people of Palestine, including its right to self-determination and the creation of a State of its own, has still not been guaranteed. All of that means that the independent existence and security of all the peoples and States of that region have not been ensured.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"139.	Serious apprehensions are aroused by the words and deeds of the leaders of Israel. They are well known. A great deal of combustible material has been accumulated in the Middle East, and in the event of another outbreak of hostilities no one would be able to predict its outcome.",UNGD
RUS,1977,140.	For its part the Soviet Union will go on doing all in its power to bring about such settlement in the Middle East as would establish a lasting peace there without infringing the legitimate rights and interests of any people or any State of the region.,UNGD
RUS,1977,141.	From this high rostrum our country declares once again that we have been and remain advocates of the just cause of the Arabs whose lands have been unlawfully taken away and are still retained by force of arms. Those lands must be returned unconditionally to the Arab peoples.,UNGD
RUS,1977,"142.	But if there is any need to reiterate once again that Israel has a right to exist as an independent and sovereign State in the Middle East, then on behalf of the Soviet leadership, on behalf of the Soviet Union, I say again that we have always adhered and will continue to adhere to precisely that line. So why should Israel not take advantage of the opportunity that presents itself and agree to a genuinely just settlement in the Middle East? That would, after all, be in its own national interests also.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"143.	The Soviet Union is in favour of an early reconvening of the Geneva Peace Conference with the participation on an equal footing of all parties concerned, including representatives of the Palestine Liberation Organization. There appears to exist now a broad understanding of the need to reconvene the Geneva Conference at the end of this year, but there are some who oppose it, and Israel is the main opponent. It appears that the Israeli statesmen will not bring themselves to climb one step higher, will not bring themselves closer to common sense and to the abandonment of their plans for expansion at the expense of other countries and peoples. The Soviet Union, as Co-Chairman of the Conference, intends to do its utmost to have it convened and make it work successfully, and it expects the other Co-Chairman-the United States of America-also to follow that line.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"144.	For more than a year now tensions have also persisted in Cyprus. No one will convince us that it is impossible to solve this problem without impairing the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus. It is clear that there a most intricate knot has been tied, but given goodwill it can be untied by peaceful means. The Soviet Union is prepared to facilitate this, and our relevant proposals remain valid.",UNGD
RUS,1977,145.	For many years now the question of withdrawing foreign troops from Korea has been on the agenda. Is it really essential that the United Nations should admit its impotence in this respect? We think otherwise. There are quite a few possibilities for solving this question so as to prevent a potential conflict from erupting in that part of the world.,UNGD
RUS,1977,"146.	There is one more point to be emphasized. In conditions of detente, and in its interests, all countries are required to abide by the fundamental principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter and in other major international instruments. This means, in the first place, pursuing a policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of other States and settling differences and disputes by peaceful means without resorting to the threat or use of force. Experience shows that it is necessary for every country to take into account the legitimate interests of other States and to measure its actions in the international arena against the requirements of detente.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"147.	Naturally, all these are basic requirements. Yet, how very often do we see that even such generally recognized norms governing relations between States are violated, and frequently in the most flagrant manner.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"148.	A great deal has long been said about those many complications and frictions in the current international situation that are due to the fact that there are still no signs of lessening military confrontation between States or groups of States. This problem is particularly acute in Europe. But on other continents, too, there are some who simply will not abandon the policy of maintaining the old blocs and forming new aggressive blocs, a policy typical of the time of the  cold war . Attempts are made to impart a  defensive  character to certain non-military associations of States as well. And what of the persistent intention to establish more and more military bases?",UNGD
RUS,1977,"149.	Attempts to strengthen and expand military blocs run directly counter to the spirit of detente. The Soviet Union and other countries of the socialist community have recently made a proposal that at least no action should be taken that could result in enlarging the existing closed groupings and political-military alliances, or creating new ones. However, the attitude of the Western countries to this initiative of the socialist States was, to put it mildly, cool. It would appear that its realization would run counter to their designs.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"150.	Let us take the Vienna talks on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe. These talks have now been going on for four years, and throughout all those years our Western partners in the talks have stubbornly sought to ensure for themselves unilateral military advantages and to encroach upon the security interest of the socialist countries. Therefore, these talks have so far produced no practical results. We urge that we should proceed to a real search for an understanding rather than just talk about the desire for an agreement.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"151.	The relaxation of tensions creates still more favourable conditions for completing, within the shortest possible time, the liberation of all colonial countries and peoples, for eliminating the racist regimes and for eradicating apartheid, the vestiges of national oppression and discrimination of all kinds. On the other hand, there is no doubt ",UNGD
RUS,1977,that the solution of these pending problems will give fresh momentum to the process of detente and add a new geographical dimension to it.,UNGD
RUS,1977,"152.	Today, colonialism is on the brink of total collapse. Conditions are improving for the further development of the struggle of peoples for their national liberation. A vivid example of this is the glorious victory of the peoples of Indo-China over imperialist aggression. That victory has opened up favourable prospects for the establishment of peace in South-East Asia and on the entire Asian continent.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"153.	It is with special feeling that we welcome the entry into the United Nations of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. Justice has been restored: the united socialist State of Viet Nam has taken its rightful place in this Organization. A large State, which has consistently taken a peaceful stand, has joined the United Nations. We whole-heartedly congratulate our Vietnamese friends.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"154.	We also welcome the admission of a new African State, the Republic of Djibouti.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"155.	When a conflict breaks out in a particular part of the world, more often than not there is, lurking in the background, either a desire to cling to colonial privileges or there are actions of a neo-colonialist nature. Let us look at what is happening in southern Africa. It is now the biggest colonialist and racist enclave in the world. An enormous majority of the population in the Republic of South Africa, Rhodesia and Namibia are deprived of the most elementary human rights. This would seem to be a boundless field of activity where those who clamour for  human rights  could best apply their efforts. But for some reason or other, they shut their eyes to the intolerable plight of millions of people. What is more, they actually connive at the shameful acts of these racist regimes; they support them and cover up their crimes.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"156.	Speaking of Africa, some are pointing their finger at Moscow.  This is where , they allege,  the tension on the continent originates . But what is our policy in Africa? We seek no privileges there for ourselves, nor do we covet concessions or bases, nor do we impose on African countries our world outlook. Our aims in Africa are independence, freedom and peace for its peoples.",UNGD
RUS,1977,!,UNGD
RUS,1977,"157.	We do not conceal the fact that in Africa, as elsewhere, our sympathies lie with the States that have embarked on a progressive path of development, a path of social and economic transformations for the benefit of the masses. We openly declare our complete solidarity with the peoples fighting for the liquidation of the remaining strongholds of colonialism and racism. The Soviet Union will do its utmost to ensure that the desire to establish peaceful, good-neighbourly relations with one another prevails among African States as well as all other States that have gained independence, and that the sources of discord and conflict stoked up between them by imperialism and reaction be eliminated. In this connection, in Africa just as in Europe it is highly important not only to proclaim the principle of the territorial integrity of States and the inviolability of their borders but also to respect it in practice. And this applies to all parts of the world, to all continents. The violation of this principle results in armed conflicts, torrents of blood and countless sacrifices for the peoples involved in those conflicts.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"158.	The sooner we do away with this anachronism of our age-colonialism, racism and apartheid-the cleaner will be the air in Africa and the world at large, and the greater will be the range of action for the policy of detente. This is what was called for by the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples adopted by the United 'Nations 17 years ago.",UNGD
RUS,1977,159.	This is also called for in the specific decisions of the General Assembly and the Security Council condemning South African and Rhodesian racists. Those decisions must be strictly implemented by all-and I emphasize this—by all States.,UNGD
RUS,1977,"160.	It will not be an exaggeration to say that there is another major world problem, and if it is not solved it is difficult to expect detente to be irreversible. What I have in mind is the development of equal, mutually beneficial economic relations between all States-in short, the restructuring of international economic relations on a just and democratic basis.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"161.	I should like to stress immediately that one cannot apply to this problem a mere  geographical  yardstick. After all, it is not along meridians or parallels that the boundaries of poverty and wealth run today. What matters here is how, by whom and for what purposes the natural resources of each country are being used. What is involved here is a wide range of economic, social and political factors.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"162.	The Soviet Union has for a long time been making a major contribution to the building of the national economies of developing countries. Representatives of many States in this hall know this, not merely by hearsay. And we fail to understand the allegations made here and there in the West-especially after the so-called  North-South dialogue  reached an impasse-to the effect that the USSR should, as they say,  lend a hand  in providing assistance to the developing countries. A strange way of putting things indeed!",UNGD
RUS,1977,163.	We shall continue to give all possible assistance to the countries which have embarked on the road of independent development. But is it not clear to everyone that developing States will hardly be able to stand squarely on their feet if they remain hobbled by hundreds and thousands of tethers of neo-colonialist exploitation?,UNGD
RUS,1977,"164.	We resolutely support their demands that all manifestations of inequality, diktat and discrimination in international economic relations be eliminated. This was reiterated in the statement of the Soviet Government submitted to the last session of the General Assembly on restructuring international economic relations.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"165.	Now, a few more words about another aspect of the development of friendly relations between States. What we have in mind is cultivating the feelings of friendship and ",UNGD
RUS,1977,"trust among all peoples, increasing mutual exchanges in cultural and other humanitarian fields. We have in mind also the need to encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion, as determined, inter alia, by the International Covenants on Human Rights. this has always been our approach to these questions and it has been clearly reflected in the draft of the new Constitution of the USSR.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"166.	But let no one have any doubts about something else: any attempts at preaching to us, at reading us sermons or, still worse, at interfering in our internal affairs under contrived pretexts, have encountered and will always encounter a most resolute rebuff. We are ready to say this once again from this high rostrum: it is high time to realize that by acting in a spirit of psychological warfare the most that one could hope for would be to poison the international atmosphere and .to sour relations between States. We should like to think that all this will be taken seriously.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"167.	An exceptionally important area where the policy of detente is being implemented in practice is the sphere of bilateral relations between States. For us, this is not an abstract proposal. !t is confirmed by our consistent policy of ensuring peaceful coexistence among States belonging to different social systems.",UNGD
RUS,1977,168.	For about 10 years now Soviet-French relations have been developing steadily without a hitch. the joint documents signed as a result of the recent visit of Leonid llyich Brezhnev to France convincingly demonstrate that joint actions of the two countries are making a major contribution to the cause of the relaxation of tensions and the development of co-operation in Europe and elsewhere.,UNGD
RUS,1977,"169.	Our relations with the Federal Republic of Germany have now been brought into a normal path, which is a major accomplishment in itself if we recall how strained they were in the not-too-distant past. We intend to go on expanding and deepening our ties with the Federal Republic of Germany in various fields. It is clear, however, that everything does not depend on us. There are quarters in the Federal Republic of Germany that are still exploiting some issues in a manner which is far from conducive to the favourable development of relations between our two countries.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"170.	We are satisfied with the way in which our relations are shaping up with Finland, Italy, Austria, Britain and other Western European States, even though all possibilities have not yet been exhausted. Relations with those countries as well as with the other participants in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe have now been put on a solid foundation-namely, in the principles and understandings embodied in the Final Act. The Soviet Union strictly adheres to all the provisions of that outstanding international document. We expect the same of all the other States whose highest representatives affixed their signatures to the Final Act of the Conference.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"171.	The meeting of representatives of the States that participated in the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe is due to open in Belgrade in a few days' time. We do not overestimate the significance of that meeting, nor do we underestimate it. For its part, the Soviet Union is prepared to do everything so that that meeting may proceed constructively and become yet another milestone on the road embarked upon at Helsinki.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"172.	Relations between the Soviet Union and the United States of America merit special consideration. It is difficult to conceive of further progress in the policy of detente unless there is at least a minimum of trust and mutual understanding between them. The experience of the late 1960s and the first half of the 1970s indicates that when both countries are guided by principles of equality, mutual interest in the fate of peace and non-interference in internal affairs it becomes possible not only to reach a number of major agreements and arrangements but also to establish useful co-operation in many areas.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"173.	Unfortunately, it must be noted that recently Soviet-American relations have experienced a certain stagnation if not a downright slump. To a somewhat lesser extent that has affected the practical aspects of bilateral ties. However, more complications have emerged now than before regarding issues of broad international concern. We, the Soviet Union, stand for the improvement of relations with the United States, for Soviet-American co-operation in the interests of our peoples, in the interests of peace. But we say just as clearly that the efforts of one side alone are not sufficient for that. In response to relevant remarks by President Carter about the desire of the United States to develop relations with the Soviet Union, Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev said that if there was an intention to translate those words into the language of practical deeds we would willingly seek mutually acceptable solutions.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"174.	The Soviet Union invariably pursues a policy of good-neighbourly relations with Japan. Soviet-Japanese co-operation is developing successfully in a number of areas. In some other areas that is not the case. In our opinion the cause lies in the unhealthy sentiments regarding the Soviet Union that are still strong in some Japanese circles. Besides, those feelings are being whipped up by outside forces. We are convinced that the situation can and must change for the better in the interests of the peoples of our two countries and of peace in Asia.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"175.	For many years now Soviet-Indian relations have served as an important stabilizing factor on the vast continent of Asia. They provide a good example of friendly co-operation based upon the principles of peaceful coexistence and enshrined in the relevant treaty. It is our firm intention to continue promoting the development, intensification and enrichment of our ties with India.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"176.	A few words now about our relations with a large neighbouring country, China. Our position in this respect was defined by the Twenty-Fifth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. From the rostrum of the Congress L. I. Brezhnev stated:",UNGD
RUS,1977," As regards China, as well as other countries, we adhere firmly to the principles of equality, respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-interference in each other's internal affairs and the non-use of force. In short, we are prepared to normalize relations with China in accordance with the principles of peaceful coexistence.  And that position of ours remains fully valid.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"177.	Every State, be it in Europe or in Asia, in Africa or in Latin America, if it is guided by the interests of peace and co-operation, can rest assured that it will find a reliable partner in the USSR. In this regard we have an open mind.",UNGD
RUS,1977,178.	For the Soviet Union-and we are confident this is true of others—the struggle for the deepening of detente is at the same time the struggle for the complete elimination of the risk of nuclear conflict. Widening the scope of detente means at the same time pushing back the risk of mankind's finding itself under the crushing steam-roller of a nuclear war. These are in fact two most important aspects of securing a genuinely solid and genuinely lasting peace on earth. It was precisely the atmosphere of detente that made it possible to undertake some major actions with a view to reducing the nuclear threat.,UNGD
RUS,1977,179.	In this connexion one might single out the 1973 Soviet-American Agreement on the Prevention of Nuclear War. Mention could also be made of the Soviet-French agreement to prevent the accidental or unauthorized use of nuclear weapons.11 The interests of peace require that similar agreements be concluded between all the other nuclear Powers as well.,UNGD
RUS,1977,"180.	However, there is still a lot more to be done than has been done. We call upon the United Nations and its Member States to continue and intensify their efforts so as to reduce step by step the likelihood of the aforementioned threat in order subsequently to remove it from the lives of human beings.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"181.	Of course the most radical and effective means of preventing nuclear war would be the complete elimination of nuclear weapons. The Soviet Union has favoured this course ever since that very moment when the world saw the first ominous silhouettes of nuclear explosions. Now, as before, we repeat our readiness to sit down at any time, together with all the other nuclear Powers, at the negotiating table to examine the problem of nuclear disarmament in its entirety and jointly to work out concrete ways for its practical solution.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"182.	But while there are no such negotiations—through no fault of our own-one cannot sit twiddling one's thumbs. Any steps would do in this respect provided they bring us closer, even by an inch or two, even gradually but steadily, to a complete removal of the threat of nuclear conflict.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"183.	The United Nations has played a certain role in creating a favourable political climate as regards the problem of averting a nuclear war. It suffices to recall the resolution adopted five years ago on the non-use of force in international relations and permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons [resolution 2936 (XXVII)]. And yet we should like to see a more active United Nations in this matter, which is of the greatest concern to mankind.",UNGD
RUS,1977,184.	How might that look in practice?,UNGD
RUS,1977,"185.	Using the full weight of its prestige the United Nations could, on behalf of all its Member States, solemnly call upon all States to act in such a way as to prevent the emergence of situations which could cause a dangerous strain in relations between them and to avoid armed conflicts.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"186.	This applies particularly to nuclear-weapon States. What is required of them is continuous restraint in their mutual relations and a readiness to negotiate and settle their differences by peaceful means. In short, they should do all they can to prevent the emergence of conflicts and situations .which give rise to international tensions. After all, they are often but a step away from armed conflicts, and can one always guarantee that such a step will not be taken?",UNGD
RUS,1977,"187.	This is closely connected with strict observance of the principle of renunciation of the use or threat of force in international relations involving both nuclear weapons and conventional armaments. This principle has already been enshrined in a series of recent bilateral and multilateral agreements, including the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. The non-aligned movement actively advocates the establishment of this principle in relations between States.",UNGD
RUS,1977,188.	The United Nations would accomplish a great deal by calling on ail States to start negotiations to conclude a world treaty on the non-use of force in international relations. The draft of such a treaty has been circulated among all Members of the United Nations. The replies received by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to the questionnaire relating to their attitude to the idea of its conclusion point to a growing interest in our proposal. We are in favour of translating this idea into reality as early as possible.,UNGD
RUS,1977,189.	The joint initiative of the socialist countries advanced last November also had to do with the prevention of nuclear war. This is a proposal addressed to the countries that participated in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe to conclude a treaty whereby each would engage not to be the first to use nuclear weapons against the others. This would be of tremendous significance not only for Europe but for the world at large. We express the hope that the States to which this initiative is addressed will adopt a serious attitude. No one should dismiss a proposal which is dictated by life itself. We shall continue to work persistently to translate into practical terms the idea of concluding such a treaty.,UNGD
RUS,1977,190.	I shall mention yet another area where in our view it is possible to arrive at an agreement that would reduce the threat of war. Nuclear countries could start negotiations with a view to working out arrangements concerning the withdrawal of ships carrying nuclear weapons from certain areas of the world's oceans.,UNGD
RUS,1977,191.	Other steps are also possible to curb the arms race. On a broader plane this would meet with the desire of non-nuclear States to establish zones of peace completely free from nuclear weapons. They could include both individual .countries or groups of States and vast geographical regions or even entire continents.,UNGD
RUS,1977,"192.	In this connexion, we reaffirm our sympathetic attitude to the idea of turning the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace. The main prerequisite for this is the dismantling of the foreign military bases that exist there and the prevention of the establishment of new ones. It is precisely from this position that the Soviet Union approaches this idea. And it is from the same angle that we are holding consultations with the United States on certain problems relating to the Indian Ocean.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"193.	An extremely important question which attracts the closest attention throughout the world is the limitation of strategic arms. The need to contain the threat of nuclear war, to achieve progress in other areas of the struggle to end the arms race and for disarmament, the strengthening of international security and the further development of the process of detente call for the speediest solution of this pressing issue. And the United Nations has every right to expect from the countries participating in the talks on the limitation of strategic arms more intensive efforts for their speedy and effective completion and also to call on those States to come to a common agreement on the renunciation of the development of even more destructive systems of such weapons.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"194.	As far as the Soviet Union is concerned, its stand is well known. The USSR has invariably sought to achieve an agreement on the limitation of strategic arms and has done and is doing everything in its power to that end. We are prepared to go even further and to proceed to negotiations on the reduction of existing stockpiled arsenals of strategic weapons.",UNGD
RUS,1977,195.	What is the state of affairs in this respect'?,UNGD
RUS,1977,196.	It is an open secret today that the USSR and the United States were able some time ago to agree to a considerable extent on a new Soviet-American agreement on the limitation of strategic offensive arms on the basis of the well-known Vladivostok agreements. Yet subsequently much of what was agreed upon has been called into question-not by us.,UNGD
RUS,1977,"197.	What is the reason for this? The reason is clear. What is involved here above all is the decision of the United States to begin deploying a new type of strategic weapon, the so-called cruise missiles. Thus yet another channel has been opened for the strategic arms race and of course it would be naive to think that the other side would be a passive onlooker.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"198.	So what will happen in the long run? Certainly not the strengthening of security-this is openly admitted even in the United States-and certainly not a reduction in military expenditures. The result will be greater rivalry, more billions which could be used far more sensibly thrown into the bottomless pit of the arms race, and consequently greater dangers for peace.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"199.	Even now it is not easy to reach an agreement in the field of limiting strategic arms, but the situation would become a more complicated if we had to deal with weapons whose limitation hardly lends itself or does not lend itself at all to verification by the other side. And this could spell extreme danger in the military and political fields. In this really what the USSR and the United States should strive for?",UNGD
RUS,1977,"200.	No, it certainly is not. It may be said with confidence that a positive conclusion of the Soviet-American talks on the limitation of strategic arms is extremely important for the peoples of our two countries, for the peoples of the entire world. As-a result of recent meetings in .Washington some progress has been achieved in bringing closer together the positions of the two sides, and this is all to the good. However, there still remain issues to be agreed upon. It is important now to ensure the prompt successful completion of the talks. I repeat that we are doing everything possible to that end in the firm belief that a mutually acceptable agreement at the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks is quite feasible, of course on the basis of strict observance of the principle of the equality and equal security of the sides. We cannot back-track from this unchallengeable position.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"201.	While speaking of nuclear missiles, we should not forget that there may emerge new and terrifying means of the annihilation of people. Is it not true that the threat of war will increase many fold if ever more new types and systems of weapons of mass destruction are developed? Two years have elapsed since the Soviet Union proposed the conclusion of an international agreement which would ban their emergence. Negotiations are under way and this of course is a positive factor, but progress has been rather slow.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"202.	In the meantime, ever more sophisticated means of killing people go into production from laboratories and experimental facilities. It is the duty of the United Nations to call upon all States to put a dependable road-block in the way of the emergence of new types and systems of weapons of mass destruction.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"203.	Today the problem of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons is most acute. It is a fact that many States have not yet become parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and some of those countries are near-nuclear States or have already attained the capability of manufacturing such weapons. Is it really necessary, for example, to speak of the grave consequences for the security of the peoples of Africa and for universal peace which might result from actions of the Republic of South Africa taken in order to get hold of nuclear weapons? We believe that urgent and effective efforts on the part of all Member States of the United Nations are required to prevent the development of such weapons in the Republic of South Africa. We must not wait for the potential threat inherent in the spread of nuclear weapons all over the world to become a reality.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"204.	The Soviet Union is a convinced advocate of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Our country is already co-operating in this field with many States and we are prepared to expand that co-operation. However, we are categorically opposed to a state of affairs in which the peaceful uses of the atom would become a channel for the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and yet this is a real danger which is growing. What is required here is co-ordination of the efforts of many States and an elaborate international system of safeguards and controls. We intend to co-operate constructively in this area.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"205.	The prohibition of all nuclear-weapon tests would be a major step towards lessening the threat of a nuclear war and deepening detente. As is well known, the Soviet Union has proposed that a treaty be concluded to this effect. Moreover, to meet the wishes of some countries we have expressed our willingness to take part in the search for a generally acceptable agreement on the question of verification. Today we are taking yet one more step forward: under an arrangement with the United States and the United Kingdom we have consented to suspend underground nuclear-weapon tests for a certain period of time even before the other nuclear Powers accede to the future treaty.",UNGD
RUS,1977,"206.	It is also important that the countries which have not yet acceded to the treaties on the nuclear weapon test ban in three environments, on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and on the non-emplacement of nuclear weapons on the sea-bed and in outer space /see resolution 2660(XXV)j become parties to them and, pending their accession, strictly observe the provisions of those treaties.",UNGD
RUS,1977,207.	Such are the ideas regarding the key international problems-making detente stable and preventing nuclear war-which the Soviet Union deems it necessary to set forth at the current stage of the development of the international situation from the high rostrum of the United Nations.,UNGD
RUS,1977,"208.	Guided by these considerations, the Government of the USSR proposes the inclusion in the agenda of the thirty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly, as an important and urgent question, an item entitled  Deepening and consolidation of international detente and prevention of the danger of nuclear war .",UNGD
RUS,1977,"209.	At the same time, the Soviet Union is submitting for consideration by the General Assembly two draft documents: a draft declaration on the deepening and consolidation of international detente and a draft resolution on the prevention of the danger of nuclear war .",UNGD
RUS,1977,210.	We should like to express the hope that the Assembly 'at this session will give thorough consideration to those documents and address a corresponding appeal to all States of the world. In the current situation in the international arena this would no doubt facilitate greater and broader efforts in favour of the security of peoples.,UNGD
RUS,1977,211.	Increasingly broad opportunities to work for the benefit of peace are opening up before the United Nations in conditions of detente. The key to the success of this noble mission is the strict adherence of all the Members of tills body to the United Nations Charter. The Charter contains all that is essential for preserving and strengthening peace on earth.,UNGD
RUS,1977,"212.	Our country will work tirelessly for the benefit of peace, hand in hand with fraternal socialist States, together with all our allies and friends, and with the realistically minded forces which put the ensuring of peace and the prevention of the risks of war above transitory considerations. Our country will constantly labour for peace.",UNGD

RUS,1977," It is our belief-it is our firm belief—that realism in politics and the will for detente and progress will ultimately prevail and that mankind will be able to step into the twenty-first century in conditions of peace, secure as never before.

It has become customary for representatives of practically all States to expound the views of their Governments concerning the crucial issues of war and peace at regular sessions of the United Nations General Assembly. Indeed, the United Nations, the most representative international forum, is the right place to raise in their full dimensions issues on whose solution largely depends the future of mankind.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"37.	The United Nations was established specifically for that purpose. It emerged immediately after the fiery steamroller of the Second World War had driven over Europe and a considerable part of the rest of the world. Today, memories of those days are still fresh in our minds. Words fail to describe fully what that war visited upon mankind.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"38.	Both the generation that had to live through the war and the present generation realize that the victory won over the forces of fascism and aggression is of historic world significance. It changed the political image of the planet and brought to an unprecedented pitch the activities of forces working for peace, national liberation and social progress. The sword of justice smote those who had instigated the aggression. Such are the lessons taught by history itself-history, the most authoritative teacher.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"39.	Looking back over the path traversed in international affairs over the post-war decades, including the troubled years of the ""cold war"", peoples, Governments and political figures—unless of course they are laymen in politics—cannot afford to ignore the major imperative of bending every effort to prevent another military catastrophe which would be even more disastrous for mankind than the two world wars taken together.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"40.	The fact that it has proved possible to avoid a major war for almost a third of a century is undoubtedly a great achievement of the peoples. They are increasingly showing that they hate war, reject and curse it as a means of resolving international disputes and controversies.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"41.	Representatives of the Soviet Union, speaking in various international forums on behalf of our people and of the Communist Party, which is the nucleus of the political system of Soviet society, have always emphasized the theme of peace, and will continue to do so. The fundamental law of the Soviet State, its new Constitution, declares: ""The USSR steadfastly pursues the Leninist policy of peace and stands for strengthening the security of nations and broad international co-operation.""",UNGD
RUS,1978,"42.	We are implementing that policy, hand in hand with our friends and allies. The recent meeting in the Crimea of Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev with the leaders of fraternal parties and States has shown with new strength that the socialist community firmly follows the course of peace, detente and international co-operation.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"43.	The fraternal socialist States are justly proud of the fact that through their consistent activities year after year, month after month, almost day after day, they are making no small contribution to preserving peaceful conditions for the life and creative work of peoples on earth.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"44.	Yet it would be naive to deny another thing: peace will not become more durable, detente more reliable, unless the efforts of socialist States are reciprocated by other countries. That in turn calls for a willingness, despite differences in social systems, to resolve controversial issues at the negotiating table, without seeking unilateral advantages.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"45.	The participants in this General Assembly session will probably agree that we have not gathered here merely to express our satisfaction at the fact that, so far, peace has been preserved. What is much more important is to mobilize additional efforts and find new possibilities of shielding the peoples from aggression and from a world conflict in the future as well.",UNGD
RUS,1978,46.	The will of the Soviet people and the policy of our State was expressed in a penetrating and meaningful manner by Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev in these words:,UNGD

Yet the situation in different parts of the world is taking shape differently, for the world is full of contradictions and the influence exercised by those forces which are working for stronger international security and the freedom of peoples and that exercised by those who on the contrary are attempting to encroach on them is felt differently in various parts of the world.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"48.	The continent of Europe has made the greatest headway towards establishing durable peace. It is in Europe that major moves towards peace on a collective and bilateral basis have been accomplished in recent years. Several hurdles have been surmounted, one after another, in improving relations between countries with opposing social systems. The political climate in Europe today is clearly healthier than before.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"49.	The results of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe have been a fresh and considerable impetus. It is no secret that from time to time attempts are made to put the durability of those results to a test. However, detente has been and continues to be the dominant trend in European international life. And surely this is demonstrated by the development of relations between the Soviet Union and other socialist countries on the one hand and France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Finland and the Scandinavian and many other States on the other.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"50.	Europe now appears to have reached a stage where the opponents of detente are hard put to it to reverse the course of events. However, this does not mean that (he fruits of improved relations between States will fall by themselves into the hands of the peoples.

Africa, with its 400-million population, is seething, Newly-liberated States are in the process of self-assertion, shedding the last shackles of colonialism. Following the adoption by the United Nations in I960 of the historic Declaration oil the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples almost all of them hare gained their national freedom almost all, but not all. The colonial order still persists in Rhodesia, Namibia and the Republic of South Africa, with its barbaric forms of racial discrimination.",UNGD

How many words and how much paper are wasted in casting aspersions on the policy or the Soviet Union and other socialist countries in connexion with the situation in some parts of Africa. And who is doing all this'? Those who are clinging to the remnants of colonialism and racism. Aware that what they are doing is hardly popular, to say the least, they are attempting to cover up their neo-colonialist moves and to deceive the peoples. Apparently such devices will be resorted to m the future as well. Yet, deceit will get no one very far; the peoples will know how to tell the truth from a lie.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"53.	Colonialism and racism must be fully and irrevocably eliminated from the African continent too. Those who want to preserve the racist regimes, which are so odious to the peoples of Africa, must realize that their cause has been lost, and lost irretrievably.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"54.	As in the past, we make no secret of the fact that our sympathies are tin the side of the peoples fighting for their national independence and social progress. But we are not seeking any advantages fur ourselves either in Africa or in the developing countries in other continents.

Hardly anyone would dare to say that the situation in the Middle East is not fraught with the danger of another explosion.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"58.	What is the root-cause of such a situation? It lies in the fact that 10 years after the aggression its consequences have still not been eliminated, while the aggression itself goes unpunished. Israel continues to hold sway over territories it has seized. Unfortunately, even in the Arab world there are some politicians who display no concern about Arab lands and who are inclined to neglect the legitimate rights of the Arabs, especially the Palestinian Arabs, and to cringe and surrender to the demands of the aggressor and those who protect him.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"5V. The Soviet Union has repeatedly stated its willingness to play a part in ensuring peace in the Middle East and to participate in the most stringent international security guarantees for alt States of that area. Israeli spokesmen contend that they have no use for international guarantees. This is no more than empty polemical bravado. If Israel genuinely cared for its security - real, not illusory, security it would seek a political solution. For the fact is that with existing means of warfare the distance from the borders to which a neighbouring State has withdrawn its guns is of little consequence. What is required here is a radical breakthrough towards a situation in which the guns would be altogether silent.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"60.	Only a solution that would guarantee the right to independence and security of all States and peoples in the Middle East, including the Arab people of Palestine, who are fully entitled to a national home, a State of their own, can lay the foundations for a lasting peace in that part of the world.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"61.	All the accumulated experience, particularly recent experience, indicates that a radical and comprehensive settlement in the Middle East can be achieved only oil the basis of joint efforts by all the parties directly concerned. Separate deals at the expense of the Arabs have only side-tracked the solution of the problem.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"62.	And such, precisely, is the nature of the understandings reached at the recent three-sided meeting at Camp David. If one looks at things realistically, there are no grounds for believing that they, as claimed, bring a Middle East settlement closer. On the contrary, what this is all about is a new anti-Arab step making it more difficult to achieve a just solution of this pressing problem. That is why a campaign of artificial and affected optimism can mislead no one.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"63.	There is machinery specifically established to achieve peace in the Middle East, and that is the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East. The sooner an end is put to attempts to keep it in a state of paralysis, the nearer will be the moment when the solution of the Middle East problem can be tackled with a chance of success.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"64.	For many years, many decades, the peoples of Asia, the most heavily populated continent in the world, have been concerned about how to ensure peace, security and possibilities for development and progress in that area. The key to this, in our view, lies in joint action by all Asian States without exception. This is particularly urgent in the present conditions when developments in Asia are revealing certain disquieting traits. It is not fortuitous that among Asian countries there is a growing realization of the fact that conflicts, crude pressure and interference in internal affairs, which not so long ago went so far as to assume the dimensions of military intervention, and attempts to pit Asian States one against the other should give way to a stable peace.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"65.	It is in this perspective that the creation of a unified Viet Nam, which had expelled the aggressors from its territory and is today pursuing a peace-loving policy, is of tremendous importance. The Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, which has heroically lived through all the hardships of a long and bitter war, is now courageously defending its sovereignty. From the United Nations rostrum the Soviet Union once again declares its solidarity with Viet Nam and states that the hegemonistic claims with which it is being confronted are totally inadmissible.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"66.	The Soviet Union favours good relations with those Asian States which in turn seek mutual understanding and good-neighbourly relations with us. Such are our relationships with most Asian States, and in several cases they go back a good many years. Along with equal and mutually advantageous co-operation based on the principles of mutual respect, strict observance of sovereignty and the principle of non-interference in each other's internal affairs, we are united with those countries by our common concern for strengthening peace and security in Asia, our joint struggle against the designs of the forces of imperialism, colonialism and racism.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"67.	One striking example of multifaceted friendly cooperation, of peaceful coexistence of States with different social systems, is the relationship between the Soviet Union and India. This relationship, with long-standing traditions of good-neighbourliness, is steadily on the rise, in its development on the firm basis of the Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Co-operation.  It is consonant with the vital interests of the peoples of the two countries and constitutes an important and effective factor for peace on the Asian continent and throughout the world.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"68.	If we do not have such relationships with all Asian States, the responsibility for that is not ours. It rests squarely on those who persist in following a hostile line with regard to our country, a line which is hostile to the cause of peace in general. Those who, while themselves pursuing hegemonistic aims, try to peg the label of hegemonism on others are making a travesty of the facts.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"69.	Of course, it is not immaterial to the interests of peace in the Far East and the Pacific to note what policy is followed by Japan. Unfortunately, its policy has been showing some disquieting trends. One may well wonder whether that country might not eventually step on to the path that has led in the past to enormous sufferings for other peoples and plunged Japan into catastrophe. I should not like to draw any final conclusions; yet serious attention should be paid to all this. We believe that our concern is shared by many.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"70.	Our policy with regard to Japan has been and will remain a policy of principle. We stand for good relations with that country, for genuinely good-neighbourly relations. However, appropriate moves by Japan are also required.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"71.	Let us now turn to another continent, Latin America. Its role in world affairs is on the rise, and what is particularly noteworthy is that Latin American countries increasingly seek to have an independent voice.

The Soviet Union wishes the countries and peoples of Latin America nothing but good.",UNGD

Oceania is very far from us, but we wish to maintain normal and, where possible, friendly relations with the countries of that area as well. Here, too, we regard with sympathy the aspirations of the peoples to gain independence and to free themselves from foreign tutelage, in both the literal and the figurative meaning of the word.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"73.	In this connexion, one cannot ignore the actions of the United States in respect of Micronesia in a bid to lay its hands on a Territory which is temporarily under its trusteeship and to make those islands serve its own military and strategic plans in violation of the United Nations decisions and in circumvention of the Security Council.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"74.	What follows from this review of the state of affairs in the world, brief as it is? First of all, despite the contradictory nature of the current world developments, the international situation on the whole is better than, say, 10 or 15 years ago.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"75.	At the same time, it is clear that the international situation does not depend solely on the state of affairs in this or that area of the world. There are international problems which it is difficult or even impossible to fit into a geographical framework. The most crucial, most burning and most truly global problem affecting all countries and peoples is the ending of the arms race and disarmament.",UNGD
RUS,1978,76.	The truth which is recognized today by all is that enormous resources are being spent to manufacture engines of destruction. It is indeed a fact that in this time of peace more than 25 million men are in military uniform; and there are many more people who are directly or indirectly engaged in military production. All this represents a colossal drain on the material and intellectual resources of mankind.,UNGD
RUS,1978,"77 There are those who may say that something is nevertheless being done to contain the arms race. Recently, for example, a special session of the United Nations General Assembly devoted to disarmament was convened. It reflected the determination of peoples to do away with the arms race and to direct the course of events towards disarmament and eventually general and complete disarmament. The session did adopt a comprehensive Final Document [resolution S-10/2/ which on the whole is a good one.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"78.	The Soviet Union can note with satisfaction that many ideas that it proposed became an organic part of the Final Document. Like all those who are not merely paying lip- service to disarmament but are actually seeking disarmament, we believe that the decisions taken at the special session must be translated into the language of practical deeds by States, failing which they will remain empty phrases.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"79.	If one is to take a sober view of things, one must recognize, however, that the arms race has not diminished one whit. A group of States and everyone knows which- has decided to earmark huge additional appropriations for an arms build-up over many years to come. The decision taken by the North Atlantic Council session of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Washington and the subsequent steps to intensify military preparations in a number of countries can only be interpreted as a challenge to those who are working for disarmament.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"80.	Regardless of all the attempts of the instigators of the arms race to make things look as if the security of States will be all the more reliable the bigger their military arsenals are, the facts are quite different. As the number of weapons grows, as new and ever more destructive types of weapons emerge, the risk of war also increases. People will not accept any excuses such as references to a ""threat from the USSR"". Such references are completely spurious.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"81.	Who but the Soviet Union is making one proposal after another designed to halt the arms race, to check it from this or that angle, and to prevent the development of new means of warfare? And who is rejecting these proposals out of hand0 The opponents of disarmament are doing this.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"82.	By now and Western statesmen recognize this-there exists an approximate equality or parity in weapons. The Soviet Union-and we reaffirm this does not intend to change this correlation in its favour. What is more, we have been and are proposing now that the levels of military confrontation be reduced that is, that the security of each and every one be ensured with lesser quantitative and qualitative parameters of armaments and armed forces.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"83.	As was clearly emphasized by Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev, "". .. there is no type of armaments, and above all weapons of mass destruction, that the Soviet Union would not be prepared to see limited and banned reciprocally, in agreement with other States, and then eliminated from the arsenals"".",UNGD
RUS,1978,"84.	Our country has a comprehensive programme for curtailing the arms race. Our proposals were put forward here in the United Nations only a few months ago. It will be recalled that they will remain the subject of further discussion in various bodies dealing with disarmament. We shall never tire of taking such initiatives, and they will not become tarnished because of this, since the need for specific action in all the sectors of the struggle for disarmament, for the prevention of another war, is increasing rather than diminishing.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"85.	In circumstances where the arms race is being stepped up and the world is sliding downhill in this respect, the first thing to do is to stop completely and further quantitative and qualitative build-up of arms. Clearly, this applies above all to States with large military potentials.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"86.	It will be recalled that on a practical plane the Soviet Union has urged the discussion of a set of sweeping measures which could be carried out within a. specified limited period; cessation of the production of all types of nuclear weapons; cessation of the production, and prohibition of, all other types of weapons of mass destruction; cessation of the development of new types of conventional armaments of great destructive capability; renunciation by the permanent members of the Security Council, and by countries which have military agreements with them, of the expansion of their armies and the build-up of their conventional armaments. We expect those proposals to be treated seriously and to be examined in practical terms.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"87.	The greatest threat to peace-and this is something that is now recognized everywhere-stems from the nuclear- arms race. Consequently, priority should be given to nuclear disarmament. On this matter we see eye to eye with most States of the world, including the developing countries.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"88.	Why is it not possible to couch in treaty language an obligation by States to discontinue the production of all types of nuclear weapons so as to move then to a gradual reduction of their stockpiles, and all the way to their complete destruction? But such obligations cannot materialize out of thin air; they are produced in the course of negotiations-and we have been insisting on the necessity for such negotiations.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"89.	In the opinion of the Soviet Union, what is required is that all the nuclear Powers as well as a certain number of non-nuclear States get together at a conference table and that an exact date for the beginning of the negotiations be set And this session of the General Assembly should have its say in this regard and make an appropriate appeal to all the nuclear Powers in the first place.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"90 Any major task, and particularly that of nuclear disarmament, calls for maximum realism once you have begun to tackle it. In the world of today it is inconceivable that such a task can make any headway unless action is taken at the same time to strengthen political and international legal guarantees for the security of States. In this connexion, the proposal to conclude a world treaty on the non-use of force in international relations is becoming ever",UNGD
RUS,1978,more urgent.,UNGD
RUS,1978,"91.	While emphasizing as a great achievement of the peoples the fact that peace has been preserved for more than a third of a century now, we should not forget even for an instant how great are the dangers that lie in wait for mankind. Fully to deliver the peoples from the threat of nuclear war: this is what underlies our proposal.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"92.	The same purpose is served by concrete initiatives of the Soviet Union, and today we are stressing them again, expecting that they will elicit the understanding and support of the General Assembly.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"93.	What is involved here in the first place is the strengthening of security guarantees for non-nuclear States; and secondly, the non-stationing of nuclear weapons on the territory of States where there are no such weapons at present.",UNGD
RUS,1978,94.	It will be recalled that recently our country has taken a step conducive to instilling among non-nuclear States greater confidence in their security. The Soviet Union has declared that it will never use nuclear weapons against countries which renounce the production and acquisition of nuclear weapons and which do not have them on their territory.,UNGD
RUS,1978,"95.	Following our lead, the United States and the United Kingdom, for their part, have made declarations to the effect that they would not use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear States. On the whole, this could be regarded as a positive fact, were not such declarations replete with all kinds of reservations rendering them valueless.",UNGD
RUS,1978,96.	The Soviet Union has not confined itself to a solemn declaration regarding the non-use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear States which renounce the production and acquisition of nuclear weapons and do not have them on their territory. We have expressed our readiness-and this still stands—to enter into special agreements to that effect with any of those countries. The USSR calls upon all the other nuclear Powers to act in a similar manner and to assume corresponding obligations.,UNGD
RUS,1978,"97.	At the same time, it is clear that, if the problem of safeguarding non-nuclear States from the use of nuclear weapons against them is to be tackled in the most effective manner, agreed guarantees on the part of the nuclear Powers and a multilateral arrangement are required. In other words, it is necessary that we have an international agreement based on a pledge by those Powers not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear States parties to such an agreement provided the latter do not produce, acquire or have such weapons on their territory. A similar obligation could be extended to armed forces and installations under the jurisdiction and control of non- nuclear States—that is, to make it even more sweeping in scope.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"98.	Do non-nuclear States stand to benefit from their participation in an international agreement of this kind? Of course they do. They would be provided with security guarantees universally formalized in international law, whereas they themselves would not be required to do anything but strictly to observe their non-nuclear status. At the same time, this would be to everyone's advantage, for the threat of a nuclear conflict would diminish, and the climate throughout the world would improve.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"99.	Taking all this into consideration and in response to a relevant appeal of the United Nations General Assembly at its tenth special session, on disarmament, the Soviet Union has proposed the inclusion in the agenda for this session, as an important and urgent matter, of an item entitled ""Conclusion of an international convention on the strengthening of guarantees of the security of non-nuclear States"" [A/33I241 J. Seeking to put things on a practical footing from the outset, we have also submitted the draft text of such a convention [ibid.].",UNGD
RUS,1978,"100.	We feel that one of the merits of our initiative is that, given the goodwill of States, and of course of the nuclear States above all, it may yield practical results fairly soon. Following discussion on this question at the current session of the General Assembly, the Committee on Disarmament could immediately proceed to negotiate the text of the convention so that it would as soon as possible be open to signature by all States of the world.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"101.	I should like to turn now to our second proposal, concerning the non-stationing of nuclear weapons on the territories of States where there are no such weapons at present. It can hardly be disputed that this is a reliable way to prevent nuclear weapons from spreading all over the globe.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"102.	Here, too, we take into account the point of view expressed by a large group of States. Many countries are becoming increasingly aware of the risks stemming from nuclear weapons and they are not at all eager to have them on their territories.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"103.	In our view, this could be achieved through an international agreement to be based on a clear and simple pledge by the nuclear Powers not to station nuclear weapons on territories where there are no such weapons at present. Such an obligation would cover all types of nuclear weapons—warheads, bombs, shells, mines and so on— whether deployed as combat systems or kept in depots and storage facilities. At the same time, non-nuclear countries would formalize their intention to refrain from any steps which directly or indirectly could lead to the presence of nuclear weapons on their territories.",UNGD
RUS,1978,104.	If all the nuclear Powers were to agree not to station nuclear weapons where there are no such weapons at present—and our country has already declared its willingness to do so—it would not be too difficult to reach international agreement. The Soviet Union would like to hope that the United Nations General Assembly will respond favourably to its proposal.,UNGD
RUS,1978,"105.	The implementation of the initiatives which we are putting forth at this session would also result in a much stronger regime of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons without affecting in any way the possibilities of using nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. By the same token, our proposals, which are consonant with the idea of creating nuclear-free zones, provide even greater leeway for putting these ideas into practice through the collective or individual efforts of States.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"106.	The need to prevent the development of new types and new systems of weapons of mass destruction is being increasingly felt. Upon our initiative, the Committee on Disarmament has started negotiations to that effect; but these negotiations are proceeding very slowly. The Soviet Union is in favour of the reaching of agreement on this extremely important matter and of the stepping up of the preparation of special agreements on individual types of weapons wherever necessary.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"107.	This applies first and foremost to such inhuman weapons as the neutron weapon. The situation would become much more dangerous if the plans for its production, stockpiling and deployment materialized. It is in the interests of peace that those plans be irrevocably abandoned.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"108.	Rapid progress in military science and technology- this frenzy of armament, so to say is increasing the risk that a point could be reached beyond which it would become absolutely impossible to verify compliance with the existing arms limitation agreements or those in the process of preparation.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"109.	Wherever disarmament negotiations are taking place and whoever the participants arc, our line is directed towards achieving concrete results. An early conclusion of the Soviet-American talks on limiting strategic offensive arms is of particular importance. The essence of the problem lies in setting limits for the deployment of the most dangerous and destructive types of armaments, to be followed by negotiations with a view to a substantial decrease in their levels.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"110.	It is to be hoped that a sober-minded and well- considered line in United States policy with regard to this extremely important matter will prevail, because a new agreement is needed equally by the Soviet Union, the United States and the world at large.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"111.	Many countries on various continents welcomed the beginning of negotiations between the Soviet Union and the United States on certain questions related to the problem of disarmament and the cessation of the arms race, including the talks on the limitation and subsequent reduction of military activities in the Indian Ocean and on the limitation of the sales of conventional weapons.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"112.	Positive results could have been achieved long ago at the talks concerning the Indian Ocean. However, ever since last February they have been ""frozen"" -through no fault of ours. This is giving concern to many States which cherished hopes that the talks would help turn the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"113.	What is required, in the first place, to limit the sales of conventional armaments and their transfer to other countries'' The political basis for solving this question is to be found in criteria of international law which would take care both of the task of limiting arms sales and of the legitimate interests of peoples fighting against aggression, for their freedom and independence.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"114.	Of late, some progress has been achieved at the negotiations between the USSR, the United States of",UNGD
RUS,1978,"America and the United Kingdom on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests. It has been agreed that the treaty under preparation must impose a ban on any test explosions of nuclear weapons in any environment. It is all the more important to bring these negotiations to a successful conclusion. But for some reason or other our negotiating partners are stalling,",UNGD
RUS,1978,"115.	It is in all earnestness that the Soviet Union has been raising the question of limiting conventional armaments and armed forces. Even today the role of conventional armaments is quite important, while the efforts by States to limit them are insufficient.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"116.	No real headway has yet been made at the Vienna talks on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe. Throughout the talks we have witnessed one and the same line pursued by our Western partners: ""You socialist countries"", they say, ""should reduce more and we less"". Of course there is no proof—there could not possibly be any proof-that such a unilateral approach is justified. This is nothing but an artificial piling up of obstacles.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"117.	Our position is simple: without effecting any changes in the correlation of armaments and armed forces, their level should none the less be reduced by both sides. Some people who want to inflict damage on the socialist countries by changing the ratio of forces in favour of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ought to curb their appetites.",UNGD
RUS,1978,118.	The socialist countries have recently put forward in Vienna new proposals whose constructive nature is recognized even in the West. We are expecting a practical and positive response to them.,UNGD
RUS,1978,"119.	In connexion with the problem of disarmament, it is appropriate to stress how acute are the problems of economic development of many countries which are asking for assistance. They are compelled to overcome great difficulties. Suffice it to say that according to United Nations data 1.5 billion people, that is to say over one third of mankind, are deprived of elementary medical attention, while some 700 million people suffer from systematic malnutrition. At the same time, enormous amounts of money, unprecedented in history, are being wasted on war preparations. And, what is more, military appropriations continue to swell.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"120.	The Soviet Union has for a long time been proposing that military budgets, primarily those of the States which are permanent members of the Security Council, be reduced by a certain percentage, and that part of the funds thus saved be used to provide assistance to developing countries. This would be a major step of tremendous importance. Yet, what are we told in reply is that before cutting down military budgets they should be made the subject of study. But such a study could last for decades, and go on and on. To reduce means to reduce military budgets without any red tape-even under a pseudo- scientific cover. This calls for a political decision.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"121.	In order to overcome the stalemate, we propose that an agreement be reached on the reduction by States having ",UNGD
RUS,1978,"a large economic and military potential of their military budgets, not in terms of percentage points but in absolute figures of analogous magnitude. Such reduction could begin as early as in the coming fiscal year and cover a period of three years, with 10 per cent of the funds released as a result of reductions being channelled towards increasing aid to developing countries.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"122.	It must be emphatically stressed that the reduction of military budgets is being given priority not only as an urgent task but also as one which can fairly easily lend itself to solution—provided, of course, there is a desire to solve it.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"123.	The peoples of the whole world would heave a sigh of relief if the burden of taxation were reduced. Today, many are reflecting upon the causes for which some States - and not least the economically developed ones-are experiencing economic upheavals. Our answer is as follows: instead of throwing away immense material values on the conveyers which are continuously producing missiles, tanks, planes, guns and other means of killing people, these resources should be diverted to peaceful purposes. The resources thus released could be used to improve the living standards of the peoples of the world, to satisfy their primary needs such as housing, better medical care, education and science, and finally simply to combat famine.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"124.	All this emphasizes the great responsibility for solving the problems that face mankind in the field of disarmament, a responsibility which rests primarily with those who determine the policies of States and their line in international affairs.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"125.	So, from whatever angle one views the problem of ending the arms race and of disarmament, the Soviet Union is ready to seek appropriate international arrangements. We have submitted concrete proposals to that effect. Naturally, we shall be willing to consider the proposals of other States, too, aimed at achieving this historic task.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"126.	The Soviet Union appreciates the efforts by non- aligned States to help get the disarmament problem off the ground. The activity of the non-aligned countries in this direction, just as in other areas of the struggle for peace, is growing, and that is a positive phenomenon in international life.",UNGD
RUS,1978,127.	The General Assembly can do a good service to peace if it facilitates the convening of a world disarmament conference. It is at such a forum that decisions binding on States could be adopted.,UNGD
RUS,1978,"128.	It is all to the good that the United Nations is now more actively involved with questions of disarmament. This helps to put the relevant talks more in the limelight of public opinion. Let those who are spurring on the arms race, contrary to the will of the peoples, feel ill at ease. Everywhere in the world a moral atmosphere should be created which would make the opponents of disarmament feel pilloried.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"129.	There is no people that does not crave peace. As to the Soviet people, we can say with full responsibility that it does not seek war, nor will it start one. This applies fully to our friends and allies as well. But outside the socialist community, too, there is no people that does not want peace. We are convinced of that. In States that pursue a militarist course the watershed lies not between the peoples themselves, but when the peoples, on the one hand, and the leaders at the helm of policy-making in these States, who have sold their heart and soul to the interests of small groups which are deriving profits from military production.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"130.	States are faced with a great many international problems, whose number and complexity are unlikely to diminish with time.. But what are the conditions and what is the atmosphere in which it is easier to solve those problems'? Clearly, it is easier in the atmosphere of detente in the world, not in conditions of an aggravated situation, in a heated atmosphere. This is proved by the experience of many years.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"131.	The principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of States, no matter what contrived pretext is used to violate it, has been and remains a corner-stone of international life, of the further progress of detente. Every people that respects itself and every State with self-esteem has given and will always give decisive rebuffs to such attempts. The Soviet Union has not tolerated and never will tolerate interference in its internal affairs.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"132.	The course of Soviet foreign policy for peace, detente and disarmament is a firm course. It stems from the fundamental requirements of the social system of our State, expresses the will of the entire Soviet people, and translates into reality the directives and principles adopted by congresses of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"133.	Despite the complexity of the international situation, the Soviet people are looking to the future with optimism. Our confidence rests on the fact that the will of the peoples for peace is indomitable, that the forces favouring the maintenance and consolidation of peace prevail over those who would like to turn the course of world events in the opposite direction.",UNGD
RUS,1978,"134.	Assessing world developments in this manner, we ourselves are ready to work without respite, and we call upon all other States to be ready to do the same, notably within the walls of the United Nations, to bring all peoples closer to a reliable peace and to make impregnable and invincible the buttress built against war.",UNGD

RUS,1979,"Mr. President, allow me to congratulate you on the occasion of your election to this most responsible position and to express the conviction that your activities will contribute to a fruitful session of the United Nations General Assembly.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"93.	In the Soviet Union, as elsewhere, we learned with great sadness the news of the demise of the President of the People's Republic of Angola, Agostinho Neto. Our memories of that great political leader of Africa, that tireless fighter for peace and friendship among peoples, will for ever remain in the hearts of the Soviet people.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"94.	The current session of the United Nations General Assembly is the last one to be held in the 1970s. This gives us certain grounds not only for considering the topical issues of today but also for summing up some of the political results of the decade which is about to close and for casting a glance at the past. For the problems of today, as indeed the future itself, are more clearly seen against the background of what the past has to tell us about what action was successful and what was not.",UNGD
RUS,1979,95.	It is worthwhile to recall the circumstances which brought about the founding of the United Nations. The war was still raging and the sword of just retribution had not yet fallen on those who instigated it when the leaders of the major nations of the anti-Fascist coalition undertook a task which today still retains its vital importance: the setting up of a reliable barrier against another world tragedy. That task was indeed enshrined in the United Nations Charter as the main goal of this Organization. The effectiveness of the United Nations in maintaining international peace has been and remains the main yardstick in judging all its activities.,UNGD
RUS,1979,96.	Has the United Nations lived up to its mandate? There can be no simple answer to that question. Yet it should be recognized that it has done a lot of good for consolidating peace and promoting international cooperation. It is also evident that the United Nations could have done more than it has.,UNGD
RUS,1979,"97.	We are all aware that the manner in which the States Members of the United Nations act in international affairs cannot be reduced to one common denominator. Here the amplitude between different policy trends is great: some have not yet abandoned their claims to dominate the rest and even to hegemony in the world arena; others, naturally, cannot and will not reconcile themselves to this.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"98.	Some countries make every effort to put an end to the arms race and demonstrate a serious and responsible approach to this task; others, on the contrary, hurl ever more funds into that race and inflate their military budgets,",UNGD
RUS,1979,"99.	In short, the United Nations, as the broadest international organization, shows up in the boldest relief the characteristic features of the world with all its contradictions and collisions and, at the same time, the growing hopes of the peoples for a peaceful future.",UNGD
RUS,1979,100.	The Soviet Union has never abandoned the belief in the possibility of building a solid edifice of peace. Our people and their Government take this as their basic premise and that there is weighty reason for this has been confirmed by the decade of the 1970s.,UNGD
RUS,1979,"101.	At the beginning of the current decade there was a new lease on life, so to speak, through a series of treaties which have brought international relations in Europe in line with the realities of its post-war development. The first Soviet-American agreements on the limitation of strategic arms and the basic principles of relations between the USSR and the United States of America were also concluded at that time.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"102.	Special mention should also be made of the historic Conference of the top leaders of 35 nations at Helsinki, which sealed in a document the evolution of Europe towards stronger security and co-operation. In that period, long and serious negotiations at the second round of SALT resulted in the Soviet-American Treaty, whose entry into force, one can say, the whole world is looking forward to.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"103.	Indeed, all of us can say that the 1970s will hold an important place in history. These years have seen the positive trend in international affairs which was named ""detente"" becoming a broad process. Detente—and the Soviet Union stood at its cradle— express the aspirations of our entire nation and, we are sure, those of all peoples of the world.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"104.	The attitude towards detente is the best indicator of any country's political intentions. In recent years many a good word has been said about detente. But even very good words in favour of detente are not enough; they must be buttressed by deeds, by the policies of States.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"105.	There are still people in the world today who frown when they hear the word ""detente""; their faces wrinkle like that of a hungry cat tasting a cucumber in a kitchen-garden.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"106.	Take, for instance, the questions of renouncing the spread of enmity and hatred among nations and the prohibition of war propaganda. This is, we may say, a minimum for any State adhering to the policy of detente and desirous of promoting a healthy political climate in the world.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"107.	As far back as 1947 the General Assembly adopted a resolution against the propaganda for another war. Over 30 years have elapsed since then, but who would undertake to assert today that such propaganda has been stopped? In many States it has not even been outlawed.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"108.	The Soviet Union did that long ago. The provision stating that ""war propaganda is banned in the USSR"" is a formal part of our Constitution, the fundamental law of our State.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"109.	On more than one occasion we have emphasized the urgency of this matter. Indeed, before the guns of the aggressors who unleashed the Second World War began to thunder, war propaganda had been in full swing for many years. Incessant calls had been made for the map of Europe and of the world to be carved up to suit the aggressors' designs. The Soviet Union mentions this fact because the forces that seek to condition people to think in terms of war and the arms build-up are still active.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"110.	It is becoming a tradition in some countries to play out scenarios of military conflicts. ""Look,"" they say, ""that is how things are going to develop."" And estimates are made of the casualties and the number of cities to be swept away. Tens or even hundreds of millions of lives are written off in those callous calculations.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"111.	The ancient Greeks, and not they alone, left us wise myths whose beauty lies in glorifying what is human in man. It is not to the credit of our contemporaries that other myths are invented today which are designed to stupefy man with pessimism and to make him despair of the triumph of reason. They depict war as totally unavoidable.",UNGD
RUS,1979,112.	There is no doubt as to the purposes for which these and other myths are invented and the policies which they are designed to serve.,UNGD
RUS,1979,"113.	What a huge number of films, books, articles and speeches of politicians and ""quasi-politicians"", all shot through with falsity and deception, are produced to make people believe the fictitious stories about the source of a threat to peace.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"114.	One example is the campaign launched with regard to Cuba, in the course of which all sorts of falsehoods are being piled up concerning the policies of Cuba and the Soviet Union. But the truth is that this propaganda is totally without foundation in reality, and is indeed based on falsehoods. The Soviet Union and Cuba have already stated as much. Our advice on this score is simple: the artificiality of this entire question must be honestly admitted and the matter closed.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"115.	The Soviet Union and other countries of the socialist community have never threatened anybody, nor are they doing so now. A society which is confident of its creative forces and abilities needs no war. It needs peace. These words have been inscribed on the banner of our foreign policy ever since the days of Lenin.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"116.	The policy of peace and friendship among peoples, the policy of peaceful coexistence of States with different social systems, has invariably been expressed in the decisions of the congresses of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. This policy course will be followed unswervingly in the future- as well. ",UNGD
RUS,1979,"117.	Naturally, the USSR and its Warsaw Treaty allies cannot fail to take into account the fact that some States are continuing their military preparations and stepping them up. In these circumstances the USSR and its allies are compelled to look after their security. At the same time our approach in this matter can be described as follows: ""The defence potential of the Soviet Union"", as L.I. Brezhnev has pointed out, ' 'must be at a level that would deter anyone from attempting to disrupt our peaceful life. A course aimed not at achieving superiority in weapons, but at reducing armaments and easing military confrontation—such is our policy.""",UNGD
RUS,1979,"118.	He who trusts this policy will never be deceived. The USSR and the socialist countries can always be relied upon in the struggle for peace, disarmament and detente and for the freedom and independence of peoples. Those countries have common ideals and are guided by common goals. Shoulder to shoulder, their peoples are working hard in the grandiose effort of construction.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"119.	Indeed the whole world knows how many proposals, and what kind of proposals, have been submitted by the socialist States to other countries, first of all in the United Nations, with the aim of deepening the process of easing tensions in the world, of broadening peaceful co-operation among States, and of strengthening international security.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"120.	The countries making up the socialist community co-ordinate their policies for the sake of universal peace, the security of their own peoples and the peoples of other countries. This was again confirmed with new vigour by the fruitful results of the latest series of meetings held by L.I. Brezhnev with top Party and State leaders of socialist countries which took place in the Crimea last summer.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"121.	I feel that our opinion will not differ from that of most participants in this session if I say that a comparison of the United Nations Charter provisions with what is going on in the sphere of military activities in some countries reveals a glaring contradiction. Although those States affixed their signatures to the United Nations Charter and its peaceful purposes and principles, they are nevertheless doing everything to see that stockpiled mountains of weapons grow.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"122.	In the meantime, the world has long since crossed the line beyond which the arms race has become sheer madness. We urge all States Members of the United Nations to counter this madness with common sense and the will to strengthen mutual trust. For its part, the USSR, together with other countries, will continue to work consistently to stop the arms race, to start dismantling the war machine part by part and to reduce the military arsenals of States down to general and complete disarmament.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"123.	Here at the United Nations and at various forums where the disarmament problem is under discussion, there is certainly no dearth of proposals that are well considered and based on the principle of equality and equal security. There are proposals relating both to weapons of mass destruction and to conventional weapons. We are still seized with the question of the reduction of military budgets.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"124.	There has been no small number of major initiatives directed towards a general improvement of the political climate in the world, including the proposal for a world treaty on the non-use of force in international relations. In our view, not a single State that sincerely strives for peace and good relations with other countries could possibly object to such a treaty.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"125.	There are also initiatives concerning various regions of the world. I should like to point, in particular, to the idea of the States bordering on the Indian Ocean that this ocean be turned into a zone of peace, an idea which is supported by the majority of the countries Members of the United Nations. The Soviet Union is certainly in favour of implementing this idea. It is actively working for an early resumption of the Soviet- American talks on the limitation and subsequent reduction of military activities in the Indian Ocean, talks which were interrupted through no fault of ours. An appropriate agreement on that subject would undoubtedly give this idea a more tangible shape, and this would have a favourable impact on the entire international situation.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"126.	Yet, on the whole, one has to note with concern that all or almost all proposals for ending the arms race and for disarmament as a rule encounter opposition on the part of a number of States. They frequently get bogged down in the quagmire of debate. And it takes tremendous efforts to bring them up to the stage of decision-making, though such decisions do not yet ensure real disarmament even in limited areas.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"127.	A considerable period of time has already elapsed since the question was raised about reaching an agreement on ending the production of all types of nuclear weapons and the gradual reduction of their stockpiles until they have been completely liquidated. In our days there is no more burning problem than that of removing the threat of nuclear war. Every reasonable person understands this. And it cannot be effectively solved without stopping the assembly line producing an incessant flow of weapons of monstrous destructive power—nuclear warheads, bombs and shells.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"128.	As we have repeatedly stated, the Soviet Union is prepared to discuss this fundamental problem together with other countries, and it is proposing that specific negotiations be initiated. All the nuclear Powers without exception are in duty bound to take part in them.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"129.	It is sometimes said that ending the production of nuclear weapons and their liquidation are too difficult a task. But can this be a reason for not starting the search for ways and means to resolve the problem? We are sure that reaching an appropriate agreement is not beyond the realm of possibility if States, and first of all the nuclear States, adopt a responsible approach.",UNGD
RUS,1979,130.	The complex of questions relating to nuclear weapons includes the ensuring of guarantees of the security of non-nuclear States and the non-stationing of nuclear weapons on the territories of States where there are no such weapons at present.,UNGD
RUS,1979,131.	The General Assembly has already adopted resolutions of principle on these matters. It is now necessary to embody them in binding international agreements. ,UNGD
RUS,1979,"132 In our view, further efforts should be made to strengthen the regime of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. The responsibility for this lies upon all States. We hope that the forthcoming Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons will be crowned with positive results. This Conference will be held soon.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"133.	Negotiations on a number of essential aspects of disarmament are already in progress, and on some they have been going on for a long time. I should like to single out a couple of questions whose solution could, in our view, be found in the not-too-distant future.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"134.	Progress has been achieved in the negotiations between the Soviet Union, the United States and the United Kingdom on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests. We would expect that no complicating elements will be introduced in the negotiations by our partners. But, unfortunately, these complications are being introduced even today.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"135.	In the course of Soviet-American consultations, basic elements of an agreement banning radiological weapons have been worked out. If work on the agreement is not impeded artificially, it can be speedily prepared for signature. This means that, following the can on bacteriological weapons, one more type of weapon of mass destruction will be prohibited.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"136.	The file of constructive proposals on various aspects of the disarmament problem is impressive and proper use should be made of it. This offers broad opportunities for action by the United Nations, which, at its tenth special session, devoted to disarmament, adopted a programme which on the whole is a good one. A United Nations resolution should not merely remain on paper. For the time being, however, it is but a paper, though a well-written one.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"137.	The signing of the Soviet-American Treaty on the Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms is convincing proof that, given goodwill and readiness to take into account each other's legitimate interests, it is possible to achieve agreements on the most difficult questions. The Treaty builds a bridge to the further limitation and reduction of strategic weapons. It also contains great potential for exerting a positive influence on other negotiations on the limitations of the arms race and on disarmament.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"138.	It can be stated without exaggeration that a major step has been taken for the USSR, the United States of America and the entire world. It is quite understandable, therefore, that, one after another, the representatives of States speaking from this rostrum speak out in favour of that Treaty.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"139.	The strengthening of universal peace is inseparable from ensuring security in Europe. The situation on the European continent is not merely a part of the general picture of the world situation: today, as in the past, it has a profound impact on the course of international developments.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"140.	Since the historic moment when it raised the banner of a new social system, our country has been pursuing a consistent course towards creating conditions of reliable peace in Europe. Everything we have accomplished in the name of that goal is an open book, and we are proud of its every page.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"141.	Of course, we are far from underestimating the contributions made by other States. We give their due to the countries that took part in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, which was crowned by the adoption of the Final Act. That document provides guidelines for further efforts to deepen the process of detente in Europe.",UNGD
RUS,1979,142.	Today the basis for the peaceful co-operation of States on the European continent is more solid than it was yesterday. Favourable changes have taken place in relations between socialist and capitalist countries in Europe.,UNGD
RUS,1979,"143.	Soviet-French co-operation is on the rise. There is a considerable degree of mutual understanding and agreement on major issues of European and world politics, and accordingly there is a possibility for the further development of fruitful co-operation.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"144.	The development of our relations with the Federal Republic of Germany has been following a positive trend. Both sides appreciate the mutual advantages of what has been achieved, recognizing that a good deal could yet be accomplished in the future. I should like to express the hope that there will be no move on the part of the Federal Republic of Germany that would reduce such possibilities for the future or that would run counter to the peaceful line in Europe and to the easing of international tensions.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"145.	We are interested in the consistent development of Soviet-British relations. We are hopeful that there is a desire for this in the United Kingdom, too.",UNGD
RUS,1979,146.	We have good relations with Italy. The assets accumulated in these relations must be multiplied.,UNGD
RUS,1979,147.	I should like to note the genuine and traditional good-neighbourly relations between the USSR and Finland. We appreciate all the good achievements that have been made in our relations with other Scandinavian countries.,UNGD
RUS,1979,148.	A positive shift is taking place in our relations with Spain.,UNGD
RUS,1979,149.	The development of our ties with the rest of Western Europe is also a source of satisfaction.,UNGD
RUS,1979,"150.	On the whole, both in the field of bilateral relations with States having a different social system and in other fields, the Soviet Union is following the course charted by the Helsinki Conference.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"151.	The roots that political detente has taken on European soil cannot, however, be viable unless practical measures are taken in the field of military detente. In this regard, great prospects have been opened up by the proposals contained in the Declaration of the Political Advisory Committee of the Warsaw Treaty Organization adopted last November, and in the May communique of the Committee of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of that Organization.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"152.	First of all, I wish to refer to the initiative concerning the conclusion between the European States participants in the Helsinki Conference of a treaty on the non-first use of either nuclear or conventional weapons against each other, the intent of which is self- evident.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"153.	Unfortunately, our Western partners have not yet shown themselves ready to engage in talks on this problem. Nevertheless, we expect that a sober approach and a sense of responsibility will prompt them to react positively to our proposal.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"154.	The socialist countries are still waiting for a response to yet another important initiative of theirs— concerning the convening, at a political level and with the participation of all European countries as well as the United States and Canada, of a conference on strengthening confidence among States, easing military confrontation and the subsequent thinning out of armed forces and armaments in Europe, and their reduction. Each of those countries could make its own contribution to the work of that conference.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"155.	In the opinion of the Soviet Union, substantial work is needed on a bilateral as well as a multilateral basis to ensure the success of both the conference on military detente on the European continent and the Madrid meeting to be held next year of representatives of the States participants in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. Far from competing with each other, those two forums are complementary.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"156.	As for the Madrid meeting, it should focus its attention on truly urgent issues of detente in Europe. No narrow selfish interests should be allowed to prevent this.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"157.	Now a few words about the Vienna talks, the subject of which, as will be recalled, is the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe. This is not a problem of significance to Europe alone. Our country invariably adopts constructive positions at those talks and puts forward initiatives which also take into account the legitimate interests of the Western partners. Only strict observance of the principle of undiminished security of either party would bring the Vienna talks to the road leading to agreement, and the sooner that happens the better.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"158.	The review of problems relating to Europe would be incomplete if no reference were made to attempts undertaken from time to time by some countries to test the durability of the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin.  This is contrary to the long-term interests which provided the basis for that agreement and which must serve as guidance for all States, particularly the parties to it.",UNGD
RUS,1979,159.	The root-cause of the complexities and contradictions of the international situation at the present day lies to no small extent in the fact that the existing sources of tensions and conflicts between States do not disappear and that now and then new ones keep springing up.,UNGD
RUS,1979,"160.	There is more than one such source in Asia. It was only six months ago that aggression was committed against the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. Practically the whole world branded the aggressors as such, but have appropriate conclusions been drawn from that event by all those who should have drawn them?",UNGD
RUS,1979,"161.	This issue cannot be drowned in the artificially whipped up propaganda campaign concerning Indo- Chinese refugees, a campaign whose sharp edge is directed against Viet Nam. No, that edge should be turned in another direction, which is well known.",UNGD
RUS,1979,162.	It is also no secret who imposed and nurtured the bloodthirsty murderous regime of Pol Pot. Today that regime in Kampuchea has been done away with and there will be no return to the past. The legitimate representatives of the Kampuchean people must be given the opportunity to take the seat belonging to Kampuchea in the United Nations.,UNGD
RUS,1979,"163.	The policy of some States that are intensifying their interference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan is short-sighted—there is no other term for it. That country, which has chosen the road of progressive democratic transformation, comes out in favour of good relations with its neighbours and pursues an independent foreign policy, a policy of non-alignment. The Soviet Union, which has long-standing ties of friendship and good neighbourliness with Afghanistan, con-siders that this inadmissible interference must be stopped.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"164.	With respect to such Middle East States as Turkey and Iran, not only have we common borders but we also maintain relations of traditional co-operation with them. We take a positive attitude to the steps which those and other Asian countries take to protect and strengthen their sovereignty, and we are willing to develop relations with them.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"165.	We in the Soviet Union are satisfied with the friendly nature of relations between the USSR and India, that great Asian country with its consistently peaceful policy. The Soviet-Indian relationship is a major factor for stability and peace on the Asian continent.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"166.	We wish to maintain, naturally on the basis of reciprocity, normal good relations with all States, whether in south or south-east Asia or in the Far East. This applies to Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and other countries of those regions.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"167.	Like all peace-loving peoples, the Soviet people are gravely concerned over the state of affairs in the Middle East—one of the ""hottest"" spots on earth, where now there emanates a serious threat to peace.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"168.	The Middle East problem, if divested of what is immaterial, boils down to the following: either the con-sequences of the aggression against the Arab States and peoples are eliminated or the invaders will be rewarded by being allowed to appropriate lands that belong to others. A just settlement and the establishment of lasting peace in the Middle East require that Israel should end its occupation of all the Arab lands it seized in 1967; that the legitimate rights of the Arab people of Palestine, including the right to establish their own State, be safeguarded; and that the right of all States in the Middle East, including Israel, to independent existence under conditions of peace be effectively guaranteed.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"169.	The separate deal between Egypt and Israel resolves nothing. It is nothing but a means designed to lull the vigilance of peoples. It is a way of piling up on a still greater scale explosive material capable of producing a new conflagration in the Middle East. Moreover, added to the tense political atmosphere in this and the adjacent areas, is the heavy smell of oil.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"170.	It is high time that all States represented in the United Nations realized how vast is the tragedy of the Arab people of Palestine. What is the worth of declarations in defence of humanism and human rights— whether for refugees or not—if before the eyes of the entire world the inalienable rights of an entire people, driven from its land and deprived of a livelihood, are grossly trampled upon?",UNGD
RUS,1979,"171.	The Soviet policy with respect to the Middle East problem is one of principle. We are in favour of a comprehensive and just settlement, of the establishment of durable peace in the Middle East, a region not far from our borders. The Soviet Union sides firmly with Arab peoples, who resolutely reject deals at the expense of their legitimate interests.",UNGD
RUS,1979,172.	By adopting in 1960 the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples—one of the most significant acts of the United Nations—the world community acknowledged the indisputable fact that the hour of colonialism had struck. Since then an overwhelming majority of peoples have cast off the yoke of colonialism. But humanity's conscience continues to revolt against the fact that the shackles of colonialism and racism have not yet been completely broken. And it is above all of southern Africa that we should be talking here.,UNGD
RUS,1979,"173.	For many years now the peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia have been waging a selfless struggle for their freedom and independence. The Soviet Union is entirely on the side of their noble cause. We have raised and shall continue to raise our voice in their support, and we shall co-operate with those States, especially African States, which adhere to the positions of justice, of upholding the inalienable rights of those peoples. All kinds of combinations, no matter how superficially clever, which are aimed at preserving the domination of racists and colonialists with the help of hastily formed puppet regimes should be resolutely rejected.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"174.	Is it possible to achieve a political settlement in southern Africa? Yes, it is possible and there are ways leading to it. But so far the racists and their stooges have replied with bullets to proposals that a choice be made in favour of a just and peaceful solution.",UNGD
RUS,1979,175.	The session of the General Assembly of the United Nations will be right if it clearly states its resolute support for the liberation struggle of the peoples of southern Africa and condemns attempts to drown this struggle in blood as a crime against humanity. It is a direct duty of the United Nations to make those who ignore the decisions of the United Nations on southern Africa respect them.,UNGD
RUS,1979,"176.	The Soviet people are well aware of the contribution of the peoples of Latin America to the struggle for peace and national liberation. This contribution will be all the greater the more the stand of Latin American States in defending their independence is resolute and the less their policies are influenced from the outside. In this connexion, we note with satisfaction the growing authority of Latin America in international relations.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"177.	In its approach to all continents, to all countries of the world, the Soviet Union does not apply different yardsticks when it comes to the sovereignty of States, the freedom of peoples and genuine human rights. One cannot hold aloft the Charter of the United Nations in one situation and hide it under the table in another. The provisions and principles of the Charter must be applied equally to any State and any people.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"178.	The Soviet Union has repeatedly stressed, notably in the United Nations, the significance of the non-aligned movement and its peaceful orientation. We are confident that the non-aligned States will continue to make use of their entire political weight in the interests of peace, disarmament and detente. This confidence of ours is supported by the successful results of the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, which recently ended in Havana. This was an important forum and a major international event.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"179.	What is needed in the first place to resolve any important international problem of a political, economic or other nature is an atmosphere of peace. And whether peace will be more durable or less stable depends to an important extent on the state of relations between the Soviet Union and the United States. That conclusion is objective and indisputable.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"180.	The leadership of the Soviet Union makes no secret of its desire to have normal and, what is more, friendly relations with the United States. This only requires the observance of principles which have become well-established in international relations; and they are recorded, in particular, in the well-known Soviet-American documents—that is, the principles of peaceful coexistence between States and of non-interference in the affairs of others. We shall not allow anybody to meddle in our internal affairs. Concern for Soviet-American relations is a matter for both sides. It is only on this basis that the relations between the USSR and the United States can develop successfully.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"181.	Our position was stated with exhaustive clarity and precision by L. I. Brezhnev in Vienna, in particular, in the course of his meeting with the President of the United States, Mr. Jimmy Carter. The meeting showed that, given the wish on both sides, the USSR and the United States are able to find mutually acceptable solutions and to co-operate in the interests of international detente and peace,",UNGD
RUS,1979,182.	L. I. Brezhnev has stated:,UNGD
RUS,1979,"""There is no country or people in the world, in fact, with which the Soviet Union would not like to have good relations; there is no topical international problem to the solution of which the Soviet Union would not be willing to contribute; there is no source of danger of war in the removal of which by peaceful means the Soviet Union would not be interested."" ",UNGD
RUS,1979,"183.	In the succession of post-war developments, along with positive events there were also dangerous ones which gravely threatened the foundations of peace. A closer look at these developments would easily reveal that the evolution of the international situation largely depends upon the States which have the most powerful levers to influence it.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"184.	When those levers are activated to attain objectives contrary to, or even openly defying, the United Nations Charter, conflict situations and international crises arise. The instigators of such events usually seek to whitewash themselves and, in that, they do not hesitate to pin all kinds of labels on others. That is a procedure that is, unfortunately, sometimes followed.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"185.	One such tactic consists in juggling with the term ""hegemonism"", which in recent years has been increasingly used in international political practice. Although of recent origin, the term ""hegemonism"" denotes a phenomenon that is far from new. On the contrary, it has been known, so to speak, from time immemorial. It means striving for world domination, for domination over other countries and peoples.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"186.	The Soviet attitude towards hegemonism and domination is clear. Since its very first days, the Soviet State has resolutely objected to anyone's being a hegemonist with others submitting to his will, and to any States' holding a position of domination over others.",UNGD
RUS,1979,187.	Twenty million human lives were sacrificed by our people to defeat Hitler's designs for world domination and to bury hegemonism in its Fascist attire. This figure alone is indicative of our score with hegemonism.,UNGD
RUS,1979,"188.	Hegemonism is a direct antipode to the equality of States and peoples, an antipode to the ideal which the October Revolution proclaimed for the whole world and which the United Nations, as prescribed by its Charter, should promote in every possible way in international relations. Its manifestation in our day constitutes a serious obstacle to the process of detente to which there is not and cannot be any reasonable alternative.",UNGD
RUS,1979,189.	The time has come for all States Members of the United Nations to take an unambiguous position with regard to hegemonism—to condemn it and to block any claims to hegemony in world affairs. Its inadmissibility should be raised to the level of a principle that must be rigorously observed.,UNGD
RUS,1979,"190.	Guided by all this, the Soviet Union is proposing the inclusion in the agenda of the current session of an important item entitled ""Inadmissibility of the policy of hegemonism in international relations"" and is submitting an appropriate draft resolution to be considered at the session.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"191.	The purport of this draft resolution is that no States or groups of States should claim, under any circumstances or for any motives whatsoever, hegemony in regard to other States or groups of States.",UNGD
RUS,1979,192.	We are convinced that all those who approach the conduct of international affairs on the basis of equality and in the interests of detente and peace cannot oppose the adoption of such a draft resolution. It is to be hoped that the General Assembly will consider the draft with a high sense of responsibility.,UNGD
RUS,1979,"193.	Following the General Assembly, the United Nations Security Council, with the five nuclear Powers as its , permanent members, could also express itself against hegemonism. It would be a good idea subsequently to couch the renunciation by States of a policy of hegemonism in all its manifestations in terms of a broad international agreement and to conclude such an agreement or treaty.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"194.	In conducting its policy, our country scrupulously complies with the principles of the United Nations Charter and invariably pursues its purposes. We never lose sight of the fundamental basis of the activities of the world Organization, that is, concentration of its efforts in ensuring that the peoples can live in conditions of peace. The Soviet Union has consistently come out in favour of strengthening the United Nations, of no one's being allowed to erode it.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"195.	The peoples will assess the results of the current session, like those of previous sessions, of the General Assembly primarily in terms of what it will have achieved to make people feel more secure. Hence, great responsibility rests with all States Members of the United Nations and with their representatives assembled in this hall.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"196.	Everything positive that we can achieve today will help us in the 1980s to consolidate and to develop the successes of the 1970s. That in turn will largely determine the thoughts and feelings, the memories of the past and the faith in the future that mankind will take with it into the next millennium.",UNGD
RUS,1979,"197.	We wish, and we shall do all in our power to ensure, that the work of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly may culminate in the adoption of resolutions that will be commended by the peoples of the world.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"Mr. President, I should like to congratulate you on the occasion of your election to your highly responsible position and to express my conviction that your activities will contribute to the fruitful work of the present session of the General Assembly of the United Nations.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"93.	Speaking today from this rostrum, I should like to emphasize at the very outset the great importance which this session of the General Assembly would have if its work were successful. In view of the specific character of the situation in the world arena today, it is essential for the work of the session to be conducted in a constructive atmosphere. Its participants will have to display to an even greater extent than before a sense of realism, a considered approach to key international issues and a genuine interest in finding solutions to them.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"94.	Thereby the States Members of the United Nations would demonstrate their commitment to the principles and purposes of this world Organization and awareness of their responsibility for the destinies of peace. Indeed, this is now a vitally important task for them individually and collectively.",UNGD
RUS,1980,95.	We focus attention on this because the state of affairs in the world has lately become more complicated as a result of a sharp turn in the policies of the United States of America and some other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO].,UNGD
RUS,1980,96.	Let us look at the facts—they are more eloquent than words.,UNGD
RUS,1980,"97.	Back in May 1978, the NATO countries decided automatically to increase their annual military expenditures almost to the end of this century. Last December, they took a decision to produce and deploy in Western Europe new American medium range nuclear missile systems designed to change the military and strategic situation to the unilateral advantage of the NATO bloc. Simultaneously, Washington also announced its own multibillion dollar build-up programme.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"98.	The course chosen by the United States of America, which cannot be called anything but militaristic, is expressed in the so-called ""new nuclear strategy"". Under the cover of arguments that have nothing to do with reality concerning the possibility of some ""limited"" or ""partial"" use of nuclear weapons, the architects of this strategy seek to instil in the minds of people the idea of the admissibility and acceptability of a nuclear conflict. This foolhardy concept exacerbates the risk of a nuclear catastrophe, which cannot but cause concern throughout the world.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"99.	And is it not contrary to the expectations of the peoples of the world that Washington should have indefinitely postponed ratification of the Soviet American treaty on the limitation of strategic offensive arms, SALT II?  It has demonstrated that it sets a low value on the assurances and promises it gave earlier.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"100.	Several theses have recently been adopted by American foreign policy which, by all appearances, are regarded as its credo. Here is one of them. A given region of the world is chosen at will—especially if it is rich in energy resources or important from the point of view of transport and communications, or simply if the Pentagon has taken a fancy to it—and that favoured area is declared with naked bluntness to be a United States ""sphere of vital interest"". And if, to boot, it is a sphere of American interests, not just anyone's, and on top of that—God only knows why—of ""vital"" interests, efforts are made simply to deprive the peoples who live in that area of the right to be masters in their own home and masters of their own wealth. It is even harder to understand that at the end of the twentieth century generally recognized rules of international law hallowed by time should be so blatantly and so rapaciously flouted.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"101.	Another proposition is that any internal changes in any State—merely because they are not to Washington's liking—are considered to be a good enough pretext for United States interference in the affairs of that State, including the dispatch there of armed forces and commandoes. It is precisely these functions that have been assigned to the rapid reaction corps. And it is surely those countries which cannot defend themselves that become the first victims.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"102.	And what about the treatment of Cuba? This is a striking example. Contrary to the legitimate demands of its Government and people, a part of Cuba's territory, Guantanamo, where a United States military base is located, is held by force. But at Washington they reason in the following way: we want this base—so that is that. It is of no importance to them that the sovereign rights of Cuba and its people are thus flagrantly ignored, once American interests stand to gain.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"103.	And what a host of statements are made to justify such a policy. Those deal at length with human rights, the rights of States. It is simply amazing how such a policy can be combined with genuine respect for the rights of States, the rights of peoples, and human rights. If such statements are to be believed—and they are, incidentally, repeated with the importunity of commercial advertising—then all manuals and all books on international law, and indeed the United Nations Charter itself, which strictly protect the sovereignty of States, should all be discarded. But no verbal acrobatics, no diplomatic contrivances can conceal the real essence of such a policy.",UNGD
RUS,1980,104.	The methods of pressure and blackmail in foreign policy are making themselves felt in various parts of the globe. Blatant violence is employed against Iran. Everybody knows this. United States actions in the Persian Gulf area threaten the sovereignty not only of that country but of other countries of the region as well.,UNGD
RUS,1980,"105.	A build-up of the United States military presence is under way in East Africa, where, most recently, new American military bases have been coming into being. This is taking place in particular in Somalia, a country whose leadership continues to make groundless territorial claims in respect of its neighbours. The Soviet Union fully supports those States which raise their voices in protest against the establishment of such bases. Surely, those who offer their homes for American military bases assist in the accumulation of inflammable material in that area, with all the ensuing dangers.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"106.	The anti-Arab Camp David deal has as its direct consequence unabated tension in the Middle East, where the situation is fraught with perilous and unforeseen developments, That should not be overlooked. That deal, which runs counter to the interests of and slights the just demands of Arab States and the inalienable rights of the Arab people of Palestine, whose only legitimate representative is the PLO, is intended to satisfy Israel's annexationist claims and to affirm an American military presence in the Middle East.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"107.	In short, since the time of the separatist collusion among the United States, Israel and Egypt, the situation in that region has proved to be further from genuine peace than ever before. It is for that reason that Camp David is rejected by Arab States and denounced by all those who are interested in a just and comprehensive settlement in the Middle East, not in a settlement dictated by imperialist interests. That has been graphically demonstrated by the recent resolutions of the seventh emergency special session of the General Assembly, on the Palestinian question, and by recent resolutions of the Security Council.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"108.	In another region, the Far East, Washington is striving to strengthen its political and military position and is heating up militarist trends that are far from being on the wane in certain quarters in Japan. Beijing is acting in unison. Yet one would think that the Japanese leadership would display the ability to see things as they are and succeed in resisting the outside influences prodding that country onto the road of hostility towards the Soviet Union, a road that has already led Japan to catastrophe.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"109.	The United States, whose troops, contrary to General Assembly resolution 3390 B (XXX), still remain on the territory of the Republic of Korea, shares with the puppet Seoul regime the responsibility for the fact that the Korean problem is still unresolved. It obstructs the normalization of the situation on the Korean peninsula and the reunification of Korea on a peaceful and democratic basis without any outside interference, as is proposed by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"110.	The United States adds to the destabilization of the situation in IndoChina and in the whole of South-East Asia. Here, too, the United States acts in league with the Beijing hegemonists who, having committed aggression against the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, continue their demonstrations of military force on the Sino-Vietnamese border and stage provocations against the People's Democratic Republic of Laos and the People's Republic of Kampuchea, whose voice, we are sure, will sooner or later be heard from this rostrum. Other countries of that region are also under constant pressure from Beijing and Washington.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"111.	In recent years, the United States and some other Western countries have resorted ever more frequently to playing the ""China card""—they love it—in order to use to their own advantage the great Power ambitions of Beijing, which is itself keeping pace with the most zealous proponents of the position of strength policy and is stubbornly and cynically advocating the idea of the inevitability of another world war—with never a thought of giving up this idea. I stress this idea of the inevitable nature of a new world war.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"112.	While these countries are intent on having China follow ever more closely in the wake of their policy, Beijing, for its part, in seeking a rapprochement with them, attempts to put them on the track of the cold war and confrontation with the Soviet Union, although our country, I would note here, stands for the normalization of relations with the People's Republic of China, as has been repeatedly stated at the most authoritative level. Even if we leave aside the question of who is playing whose cards more, it must be emphasized that this game is dangerous to the cause of peace.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"113.	The facts I have enumerated suffice to lead us to the conclusion that influential circles in some countries would like to squander away the substantial assets of the policy of detente that were accumulated, especially in the 1970s, as a result of prolonged and strenuous efforts by many States.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"114.	Not long ago, at Vienna, where the SALT II Treaty was signed, there was a frank conversation between Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and President of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, and President Carter of the United States. The latter also recognized the need to maintain the existing approximate parity of military strength between East and West, the Soviet Union and the United States. This was recognized also by the leaders of other NATO countries. At present, contrary to their previous statements, the leaders of the NATO bloc are seeking to change the strategic balance of forces in the world in that bloc's favour. That is the root cause of the aggravation of the present international situation.",UNGD
RUS,1980,115.	Attempts to give a different interpretation of world developments and to cast aspersions on the foreign policy of the USSR by once again resorting to the myth of a Soviet military threat constitute a gross deception.,UNGD
RUS,1980,"116.	Only the gullible could heed the groundless assertions to the effect that the aggravation of the world situation has been caused by the temporary introduction of a limited Soviet military contingent into Afghanistan. As has already been explained repeatedly, our move was made to assist the Afghan people in protecting their country's sovereignty and repelling armed incursions into its territory from the outside, as well as to prevent the emergence of a direct threat to the security of the USSR on its southern border. That assistance was rendered in response to repeated appeals by the Government of Afghanistan, and it is in full accord with the Soviet-Afghan Treaty of 1978 and the United Nations Charter. I believe that there still exist in the United States persons who signed the United Nations Charter, which contains a provision relevant to this. Now that the situation in Afghanistan is gradually returning to normal, some of our military units have been brought home by agreement with the Afghan Government.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"117.	Not infrequently, and notably at the United Nations, one may hear persons speak in favour of a complete withdrawal of the Soviet military contingent. To that we reply that the USSR will withdraw its contingent by agreement with the Government of Afghanistan as soon as the reasons that made the introduction of a contingent necessary have been removed, but not before.",UNGD
RUS,1980,118.	It will be recalled that the Afghan Government has put forward a programme for a political settlement of the situation around Afghanistan. It is quite possible to achieve such a settlement on that basis and the Soviet Union is firmly in favour of that. But any attempts that run counter to the sovereign rights of Afghanistan are futile. The truth about the nature and essence of events in Afghanistan and around that nonaligned State is steadily gaining ground.,UNGD
RUS,1980,119.	The allegation being bandied about in certain Western countries that the Soviet Union is building up its military might on a scale that exceeds its defence requirements is also patently false. There are some experts who make such claims. Our country believes that the strategic parity of forces obtaining in the world is sufficient to protect its own security and that of its allies and friends. Our country aspires to nothing more.,UNGD
RUS,1980,"120.	Let us take Central Europe, the area with the highest concentration of military forces confronting each other. There, the Soviet Union, unlike the NATO countries, has not for a long time now increased its forces by a single soldier, a single tank, a single aircraft. On the contrary, it has been reducing them.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"121.	As for the medium range nuclear systems deployed in the European part of the USSR—we do not deploy them on the territories of other States at all—in terms of the number of launchers and the yield of their nuclear warheads, such systems have recently even been somewhat reduced. The leaders who, with a specific purpose in mind, are trying to mislead people are also fully aware of that. However, being at odds with the truth, they systematically feed public opinion with fraudulent propaganda whenever they talk about the foreign policy or the armed forces of the Soviet State. The products of such propaganda are often to be seen floating around this hall.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"122.	Against that background, it is obvious that those who speak of some unprecedented build-up of our country's defence potential are in fact trying to turn attention away from their own plans to deploy hundreds of new United States nuclear systems on the territories of several West European countries.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"123.	In order to prevent another round of the arms race, the Soviet Union has proposed negotiations to be held on the basis of equality and with observance of the principle of equal security. In order to remove the obstacles to negotiations arising from the NATO decision, we propose that discussions be initiated without delay on the question of medium range nuclear weapons in Europe and the question of United States forward based systems, concurrently and in organic interrelation. It is understood that eventual agreements would be implemented after the entry into force of the SALT II Treaty.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"124.	The USSR has not so far received a substantive reply to its initiative. The Soviet proposal is talked and written about; various assessments of it are made, and it is sometimes alleged that it is unclear or even mysterious, But those who are supposed to respond to it have as yet said nothing intelligible. And the reason for all this is that the Soviet Union's proposal is designed to find a genuine solution to the problem of strengthening European security and to erect a barrier to prevent Europe from becoming an even more dangerous staging area for military confrontation, with enormous quantities of nuclear weapons in readiness day and night.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"125.	It would seem that the delays in making a constructive reply to the substance of our proposal are intended to muffle the positive international response which it has evoked. We express the hope that common sense and a responsible approach to improving the situation in Europe will yet prevail. We would like to believe that. The Soviet Union is ready to start talks with its partners on the aforementioned just basis at any time,",UNGD
RUS,1980,"126.	Of course, if there is any lack of clarity as to the substance of our proposal, we would not be averse to removing it through consultations and exchanges of views, but it is essential that the participants in such exchanges of views should join us at the negotiating table in good faith and not just to kill time. At the same time, it must be clearly understood that the Soviet Union and the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty will not allow the military strategic balance they have achieved between them and the States members of NATO to be upset. Any calculations aimed at disrupting this balance should be discarded.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"127.	The USSR and other countries of the socialist community have never sought, and are not seeking, any military superiority. They have not had, and will not have, any strategic doctrine other than a defensive one. As Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev stated once again, with all clarity, in his recent speech in the city of Alma-Ata:",UNGD
RUS,1980,"""Our country's foreign policy is a clear and honest policy of peace which is not directed against anyone else. We do not encroach on anybody's land; we do not interfere in anybody's internal affairs. But we shall always manage to defend our rights and legitimate interests"".",UNGD
RUS,1980,"128.	Peaceableness is an inherent feature of the foreign policy of socialism, which is a social system having no classes interested in war. A world without wars, said Lenin, is the very ideal of socialism. The source from which the policy of the socialist countries draws confidence in its strength is the identity of their objectives in constructing a new society, in defending the cause of peace. To this end, the perfecting of relations of full equality, fraternal unity, comradely mutual assistance and fruitful cooperation in all spheres of life is constantly in the forefront of their attention, and this was once again borne out by the results of the meetings held in the Crimea last summer between Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev and the leaders of fraternal parties and States.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"129.	The Soviet Union and the socialist community have been and will continue to be in the vanguard of the struggle for international security. However, we do not claim a monopoly in this field. We shall stand in the same line with all States which consistently pursue a policy of peace and of averting the threat of another world war, a policy of detente.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"130.	The concrete deeds of the socialist countries are shown in a whole series of initiatives, in particular those they have advanced since the previous session of the General Assembly. These are: the proposal put forward by the meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty  for holding a top-level conference of the leaders of States of all regions of the world to discuss problems related to the elimination of hotbeds of international tension and to the prevention of war; the measures for curbing the arms race, for disarmament and for strengthening peace in Europe and throughout the world contained in the declaration which was adopted at that same meeting; the initiative of the USSR with regard to holding negotiations on medium range nuclear weapons in Europe in close interrelation with United States forward based systems; the recent withdrawal by the Soviet Union of 20,000 troops, 1,000 tanks and other materiel from the German Democratic Republic, a process which has been completed; the proposal submitted by the socialist countries at the Vienna talks"" providing, among other steps recommended, for the reduction of United States military personnel by 13,000 and of Soviet military personnel by 20,000, in addition to the Soviet military contingent which has been unilaterally withdrawn from the territory of the German Democratic Republic; and the withdrawal of some Soviet military units from Afghanistan.",UNGD
RUS,1980,131.	A comparison of the list of the initiatives we have advanced during the past year alone with NATO's record immediately reveals the contrast between the two main lines in world politics. The facts are self-evident in showing which policy line is consonant with the aspirations of the peoples and which is in conflict with them.,UNGD
RUS,1980,"132.	It certainly seems to be far from easy to create a distorted picture of our foreign policy in the minds of the peoples. Misinformation and, primarily of course, slander directed against it backfire on those who resort to them.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"133.	Given the present state of international relations— when the policy of detente is being put to a severe test, when the danger of war is growing—it is essential to multiply efforts in order to arrest this course of developments. Even if the initial steps were not to be the most radical ones possible, they would still be steps which could infuse an invigorating spirit into the international political climate.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"134.	Proceeding from this, the Soviet Union proposes the inclusion in the agenda of this session of the General Assembly of an important and urgent item entitled ""Urgent measures for reducing the danger of war"", and we are submitting for the Assembly's consideration a relevant draft resolution What is proposed here is the adoption in the immediate future of the following measures.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"135.	First, an important step would be for the States members of military alliances to renounce the expansion of existing military political groupings through the admission of new members, and for countries which are not members of such groupings to renounce joining them. All States, without exception, should avoid any action conducive to the establishment of new military alliances or to assigning military functions to regional organizations which have no such functions at present. At the same time, the statements repeatedly made by the USSR and the other socialist countries concerning their readiness to disband the Warsaw Treaty organization if, simultaneously, the NATO bloc were dissolved and, as a first step, to eliminate the military organizations of the two groupings, starting with a mutual reduction of their military activities, remain fully valid.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"136.	Secondly, it is essential that all States, and, first of all, the permanent members of the Security Council and countries which have military agreements with them, undertake not to increase as from a certain date—say 1 January of the coming year—their armed forces and conventional armaments, as a first step towards their subsequent reduction.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"137.	Thirdly, proceeding from the premise that an early conclusion of an appropriate convention, with the participation of all nuclear and nonnuclear States, would best serve to strengthen security guarantees for nonnuclear States, the USSR is also prepared to consider other possible solutions to this problem, provided the other nuclear Powers adopt a similar approach. We call upon all nuclear countries to make identical and solemn declarations concerning the non-use of nuclear weapons against nonnuclear States which have no nuclear weapons on their territories. Such declarations, if they serve the aforementioned objective, could be reinforced by an authoritative decision of the Security Council. At the same time, the Soviet Union reaffirms that it will never use nuclear weapons against those countries which renounce the production and acquisition of such weapons and do not have them on their territories.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"138.	Fourthly, we are convinced that, if our partners in the negotiations, the United States and the United Kingdom, show corresponding readiness, it is quite realistic to expect a successful conclusion within a short time limit of the elaboration of an international treaty on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear weapon tests. We consider this to be possible. There are no insuperable obstacles.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"139.	To this end, the USSR proposes that all nuclear Powers declare themselves ready to renounce within a period of one year, beginning on a date to be agreed by them, all nuclear explosions. The point is to have a one year moratorium while negotiations would continue with a view to achieving a more radical solution.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"140.	A prompt implementation of all these measures would blunt the edge of some of the issues in international relations. It could be instrumental in easing the burden of military expenditures of States, strengthening the regime of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, and creating favourable conditions for progress in the field of the arms race limitation. We hope that the General Assembly will give these proposals careful and due consideration, and that it will support them.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"141.	In today's international conditions, the Soviet Union considers it an imperative duty of the United Nations Member States to intensify their efforts in all major directions of the struggle for peace. As hitherto, the Soviet Union will maintain and deepen the dialogue and cooperate with all States that display political will towards this end. By the way, with regard to ""dialogue"", this is a term often used nowadays. One way of reasoning goes like this: if there is something I do not like in the policy of a State, I will not speak with it. But to our mind such capriciousness, such vagaries, have been widely condemned, and rightly so. There should be no place for them in politics.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"142.	At the current session, we consider it necessary to recall the United Nations decisions which have yet to be implemented, proposals put forward by the USSR and other countries, as well as to set forth our views on enhancing the efficiency of efforts in specific sectors of this historic struggle. To this end, the USSR is submitting at this session a memorandum entitled ""peace, disarmament and international security guarantees"" ",UNGD
RUS,1980,"143.	There is hardly any need to prove that the greatest threat to peace on our planet is posed by the unabated nuclear arms race. There is, however, a need to say again and again that it is inadmissible to put up with a situation where people live under the burden of a constant fear of a nuclear disaster.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"144.	While recognizing the complexities of the problem of nuclear disarmament, one should not toe the line of those who shirk even its discussion. It is for people to resolve this burning problem. People have created the nuclear weapon, and it is they who can and must outlaw and destroy it. There is no denying that man's mind is stronger than his fists. None the less, the fact remains that the negotiations proposed by the Soviet Union for ending the production of all types of nuclear weapons and gradually reducing their stockpiles until they have been completely destroyed have never started, owing to the negative position of certain Governments. We stand for the talks getting under way and for the Governments concerned to adopt a serious attitude towards them, so that the relevant decision of the special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament may be fulfilled.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"145.	The conclusion by States of an agreement on the renunciation of the use of force in international relations would be of great importance for the cause of peace and detente. In statements made from this rostrum the Soviet Union has repeatedly stressed the importance of such an agreement and of resolution 2936 (XXVII) adopted by the General Assembly in 1972 entitled ""Non-use of force in international relations and permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons"". In the current situation, the duty of the United Nations to pronounce itself in favour of the prompt completion of efforts in this field is becoming ever more imperative.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"146.	To lessen the threat of nuclear war, it is of decisive importance to check the further growth of the strategic potentials of States and subsequently to reduce strategic nuclear weapon systems quantitatively and to limit them qualitatively. And could anyone deny how significant would be the entry into force of the Soviet American Treaty on the Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, SALT II?",UNGD
RUS,1980,"147.	The USSR is ready to ratify the SALT II Treaty and afterwards strictly to comply with all its provisions. It is also the intention of the Soviet Union to participate in the negotiations on the further limitation and reduction of strategic arms, with strict observance of the principle of equality and equal security. But it would not be out of place to say in this connection that, although the Treaty has not yet entered into force, the American side is already laying a mine under it in the shape of a plan whose implementation would open up the possibility of excluding from appropriate verification a large number of strategic nuclear missile systems. I think that this is well known to all representatives in this hall.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"148.	Now that the nuclear missile arsenals of States are being constantly inflated, the question of elaborating and adopting more reliable measures to prevent the possibility of the accidental or authorized use of nuclear weapons is becoming ever more acute, and repeated false nuclear alarms in the United States armed forces give ground for serious thought in this regard. Indeed, the fact that the alarm was false becomes known later—afterwards. And this surely leads to certain conclusions. Such things should not take place if the leadership of a State deals with all questions pertaining to nuclear weapons with a sense of responsibility.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"149.	It has always been the stand of the Soviet Union that the strengthening of the regime of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons should be a subject of unfailing concern. The failure to see that transfers of nuclear equipment, materials and technology intended for peaceful purposes could serve as a channel for spreading nuclear arms is fraught with the most negative consequences. An important step would be taken if an international agreement were reached on the non-stationing of nuclear weapons on the territories of countries where there are no such weapons at the present time, regardless of whether or not these countries are allies of a given nuclear State. However, owing to the opposition of certain Powers, progress in negotiations on this question is slow, to say the least.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"150.	The lethal power of such means of mass destruction as chemical weapons does not at all pale in comparison to the monstrous destructive force of nuclear armaments. The negotiations on their prohibition have been dragging on for many years, with the distance to the finishing line—the signing of a relevant international convention—remaining almost as long as ever. It will be impossible to cover the remaining distance without energetic efforts on the part of all participants in the negotiations. We, for our part, have been persistently working towards that end.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"151.	The Soviet Union, as before, is fully in favour of observance of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction. It has always been, and remains, faithful to the spirit and letter of the Convention, which constitutes a measure of real disarmament.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"152.	Sometimes representatives of military quarters float allegations that the Soviet Union does not always respect the obligations it assumes under international agreements. But such allegations are a ploy that is as old as the universe. The reasoning of their authors is obviously as follows: if peoples are to be deceived, let the deception be huge to make an impression. But in the contest between truth and deception, truth has always been victorious sooner or later. The Soviet Union has not violated one single international agreement and it does not intend to do so.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"153.	Those who resort to such allegations attempt to weave them into a thick shroud to cover their own unseemly deeds. Look at what is taking place in the country whose representatives indulge in such statements: plans are openly being discussed there for building new plants to produce chemical weapons. I said plans are being discussed there, but it would be more accurate to say that they are being discussed here, and this is being done at a time when representatives of that very country are sitting at the negotiating table where the question of banning chemical weapons is being discussed,",UNGD
RUS,1980,"154.	And how often has the Soviet Union made representations regarding noncompliance with agreements by those who aim such allegations at the Soviet Union? Those for whom these words of ours are meant know that very well. That is how things are with attempts to cast a shadow on the attitude of the Soviet Union towards its international obligations,",UNGD
RUS,1980,"155.	The world is not safeguarded from the possible emergence in the not too distant future of new types and systems of weapons of mass destruction. This is particularly dangerous now, since forces have appeared that are counting on achieving military superiority. The USSR favours the adoption of additional measures to ensure the conclusion of an international agreement banning the development of new types and systems of weapons of mass destruction, as well as the conclusion, as necessary, of special agreements on individual types of such weapons.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"156.	Vigilance and perseverance are required in the struggle against the neutron weapon—that barbarous means of annihilation. The position of our country, which declared in the past that it would not begin production of neutron weapons unless the United States did so, remains valid and it also applies to the possible emergence of such weapons in any other State.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"157.	Objectively, there is a basis for the early completion of work on a treaty banning one type of weapon of mass destruction—radiological weapons.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"158.	Owing to the opposition if certain Powers, the question of what are called conventional armaments has actually been left outside the sphere of concrete negotiations. The solution of that question should be speedily moved to a practical plane. Representatives of certain countries wish to talk endlessly and willingly on that subject, while doing nothing, however, to facilitate agreement.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"159.	The danger of war could also be reduced in no small measure by the limitation and cessation of the arms race in particular geographical areas as well. That applies first of all to Europe. Developments in Europe have always had a most significant impact on the state of world affairs. The Soviet Union, like other countries of the socialist community, is seeking to ensure a steady continuation of the process initiated by the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and compliance with all the provisions and principles of the Final Act which it adopted.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"160.	As we are staunch advocates of the Leninist principle of peaceful coexistence, we have always striven to ensure that no avenue in our relations with States belonging to a different social system, including the United States, should remain unexplored. We expect those States to do likewise. Indeed, an overwhelming majority of them do build their relations with us in that fashion.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"161.	The course for maintaining and strengthening security in Europe and for reducing the level of military confrontation on the continent was convincingly demonstrated last May at the meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty. It was also manifested during the recent talks held by Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev with French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing and with the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, Helmut Schmidt.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"162.	In the series of proposals made by the countries of the socialist community with regard to Europe, a prominent place belongs to the initiative for the conclusion by all States participants in the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe of a treaty on the non-use of either nuclear or conventional arms—I repeat, nuclear or conventional arms. Does anybody who stands for peace object to this proposal?",UNGD
RUS,1980,"163.	The socialist countries have taken steps, some of them quite recently, which provide a solid basis for reaching agreement at the Vienna Talks on the Mutual Reduction of Forces, Armaments and Associated Measures in Central Europe. Success in that work is being obstructed by those who do not wish to give up attempts to gain unilateral advantage to the detriment of the security interests of the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty.",UNGD
RUS,1980,164.	The holding of a conference on military detente and disarmament in Europe is a matter of paramount importance. We express the hope that all States concerned will contribute to the realization of this idea. This is a good idea.,UNGD
RUS,1980,165.	A significant role in achieving general agreement on the convocation and the subject matter of the conference is to be played by the Madrid meeting of representatives of States participants in the European Conference. We wish the meeting to be business-like and to be crowned with positive results on all sections of the Helsinki Final Act. We urge other countries to display the same constructive approach to the Madrid meeting.,UNGD
RUS,1980,"166.	The problem of lessening tensions in the Indian Ocean is increasingly important. The Soviet Union has invariably supported the initiative of the littoral States to turn the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace. For the purpose of implementing that initiative, we shall continue to cooperate with all States concerned, inter alia, at the Conference on the Indian Ocean scheduled for 1981. The same objective would be served by the resumption of the Soviet American talks, suspended by the United States, on the limitation and subsequent reduction of military activities in that ocean. We are ready at any time to sit at the same table with the United States and to continue negotiations on that matter. It is now up to the United States.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"167.	The States parties to the Warsaw Treaty favour discussion within the framework of the United Nations of the question of limiting and reducing the level of military presence and military activities, be it in the Atlantic, the Indian or the Pacific Ocean, in the Mediterranean or in the Persian Gulf. Agreements in that field would serve the interests of peace and stabilization of the international situation. The Soviet Union is prepared at any time to come to the negotiating table to discuss this issue with the States concerned.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"168.	More than once the United Nations has tried its hand at achieving agreed decisions on the reduction of the military budgets of States. However, each time, it encountered resolute opposition and all means of misinformation are employed here to frustrate any progress towards agreement in this extremely important field. As a result, the military appropriations of States have been growing from year to year. And what a variety of methods have been devised by certain Governments to extract from the taxpayer ever greater sums to be fed into the grinder of military production. And this is taking place at a time when hundreds of millions of people in the world are suffering from starvation, have no access to proper medical services and education or have no roof over their heads. Resources which could be used for the benefit of people are being consumed by the arms race. Regrettably, the United Nations has not so far pronounced its weighty opinion on that score. It has great possibilities for speaking out.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"169.	Now as before, the USSR is prepared to proceed to negotiations on specific reductions, in absolute figures or in terms of percentage points, of military budgets of States permanent members of the Security Council as well as of other States with large economic and military potential. We are also prepared to reach agreement on the amounts which each State reducing its military budget would allocate for increased economic aid to developing countries.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"170.	The Soviet Union believes that thorough preparations should be carried out for the special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament, which is to take place in 1982. That session should be followed by a world conference on disarmament to ensure that a profound consideration of disarmament issues may result not merely in recommendations, but in decisions to be implemented by States fully without any exception.",UNGD
RUS,1980,171.	There must be implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples adopted 20 years ago on the initiative of the USSR.,UNGD
RUS,1980,"172.	We welcome the emergence this year of new independent States. In southern Africa there is the Republic of Zimbabwe, which was born in the flames of the long struggle of its valiant people. We are convinced that the day will come when the people of Namibia, too, will win their freedom and independence. Everything must be done to bring nearer the moment when here in this hall of the General Assembly final victory will be solemnly celebrated over the monster which has taken the lives of or crippled many millions of human beings, which for centuries has mercilessly exploited many a people and whose name is colonialism.",UNGD
RUS,1980,173.	The Soviet Union has always shown respect for the legitimate aspirations of States which have freed themselves from the yoke of colonialism. We have good relations with most of them. We note with satisfaction the increasing role of these States in international politics and appreciate the peaceful anti-imperialist orientation of the movement of the nonaligned countries.,UNGD
RUS,1980,"174.	Our country has consistently supported the developing States in their desire to attain economic independence, their inalienable right to dispose of their natural resources and their legitimate demand for the restructuring of international economic relations on the basis of equality, without any discrimination.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"175.	Problems affecting all mankind are becoming ever more conspicuous in the broad spectrum of the concerns of our time. I shall make special mention of one of them: preservation of nature. The Soviet Union wishes to see man show greater care and concern for nature, and to see natural resources used in the interests of all nations on a scientific basis.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"176.	However, everybody knows what immense material and intellectual resources are being deflected from the solution of this problem by the arms race, how ruinous and perhaps irreversible is the damage inflicted on the entire human environment by military activities of States such as tests of various types of weapons and, above all, of nuclear weapons, the stockpiling of poisonous chemical agents and so on, to say nothing of the disastrous consequences which a nuclear war would have not only for people but also for nature in general.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"177.	It is the duty of the United Nations to draw the attention of the States of the world to their historic responsibility for preserving the nature of the earth, which is indispensable for the life of present and future generations, and to make its contribution to the development of international cooperation in this field. We have submitted an appropriate draft resolution for consideration by the General Assembly at the current session.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"178.	Our views and specific proposals on important measures which should be adopted in the evolving situation stem from the peaceful nature of the foreign policy of the Soviet Union. We are convinced that the necessary possibilities for staving off the threat of war and putting international peace on a more solid foundation exist. There are forces able to do that. For it is the will of the peoples and the policies of States, not late, that determine the trend of world developments.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"179.	No responsible politician in the world can remain indifferent to the course pursued by those countries in whose policies the cult of war is becoming the dominant factor. Indeed, even here and now in the host country of the Headquarters of the United Nations there is massive propaganda in favour of nuclear war—before our very eyes, it can be said, But it is not only a question of propaganda; plans for such a war are being worked out and discussed, and this is all being done at government level. In the atmosphere of militarist frenzy which has of late become so widespread in the United States, there is ever less room left for sound and sober assessments of the world situation and well considered conclusions on the conduct of policy.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"180.	The United Nations would be right to issue a firm warning to those who seek a dangerous exacerbation of tension and war hysteria. It would be a good thing to say to those responsible: ""Gentlemen, do not push the rock down the hill, for there is a risk that you will not be able to stop it later on"".",UNGD
RUS,1980,"181.	Saving mankind from the scourge of war is the goal towards which the States should direct their efforts, instead of preparing for war. If the General Assembly took that stand, it would add a bright page to the book of modern history.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"182.	Despite all the differences in social systems, levels of economic development, national characteristics and historical destinies of the States represented in the United Nations, all peoples want to live with confidence in their future. No country, no Government, if it expresses the aspirations and will of its people, can remain aloof from the struggle for disarmament, for the relaxation of tensions and for peace.",UNGD
RUS,1980,"183.	This is the basis on which the Soviet Union acts. ""We shall continue to spare no effort"", stressed Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev, ""to preserve detente, everything positive that was achieved in the 1970s, to ensure a turn towards disarmament, to uphold the right of peoples to free and independent development, to preserve and consolidate peace.""",UNGD
RUS,1980,184.	Our country and its representatives are prepared to participate in a most constructive manner in the work of this session and to contribute actively to its success.,UNGD
RUS,1981,"Speaking from this rostrum today, I should like first of all to recall that the United Nations enjoys solid credibility among the peoples of the world as a forum whose principal objective is to serve as an effective instrument for the maintenance of peace.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"45.	It is well known that the birth of the United Nations was the result of the peoples' determination to preclude another world tragedy. Its establishment reflected the awareness, deeply rooted in people's minds following the great victory over fascism, of the need for them to unite closely in the name of peace and to prevail over the forces of militarism and aggression.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"46.	That is why the very first lines of the Charter proclaimed the goal ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war"". These are clear and emphatic words.",UNGD
RUS,1981,47.	I should like to express the confidence that these words will never fade and will never lose their profound meaning. They are a solemn oath taken by the founding States when creating the United Nations. Today that is the duty of all the 155 countries represented in the United Nations.,UNGD
RUS,1981,"48.	There, there are some who now try to contend that there are things more important than peace. However, it is obvious that the peoples have never authorized those leaders to say this on their behalf. Peace is a priceless asset of all people oil earth; it is a decisive prerequisite to progress in any sphere of human endeavor. That was true in the past, and it is all the more true now.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"49.	AS Leonid Brezhnev has stressed, ""The safeguarding of peace no other task is more important now at the international level for our party, for our people and for all the peoples of the world. By safeguarding peace we are working not only for the people who are living today, and not only for our children and grandchildren; we are working for the happiness of countless future generations.""",UNGD
RUS,1981,"50.	Acting on that fundamental assumption, the twenty sixth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union the highest forum of the Soviet Communists recently put forward a whole series of proposals on the key problems of international life, which have evoked a broad response in the world. They provide for far-reaching steps designed to limit arms, eliminate hotbeds of tension and strengthen confidence among States. They cover both the political and the military fields, deal with nuclear missile weapons and conventional armaments and bear upon the situation in Europe, in the Near, Middle and Ear East and in other regions of the world. Underlying these proposals is one single desire: to improve the international climate, to ward off the threat of war.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"51.	In the international arena the Soviet Union stands shoulder to shoulder with other socialist States. Recently, during their meetings in the Crimea, the leaders of the parties and countries of the socialist community had an opportunity once again to harmonize those countries' assessments and actions in the light of the situation taking shape in the world. The same purpose is served by regular meetings"" of the Political Consultative Committee of the States Parties to the Warsaw Treaty and by the activities of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"52.	The foreign policy of the socialist countries has been and continues to be a policy of peace. It follows from the very nature of our social system, of whose advantages we are deeply convinced. It is determined by the fact that under this system there are no social strata which would make profits out of war and war preparations or derive benefits from militaristic policies. Nevertheless, we do not impose our social system on anybody. The peoples themselves determine, and should determine, their destinies. That has always been and remains the cornerstone of the scientific world outlook that guides us in both our domestic and our foreign policies.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"53.	In building a society free from social and national exploitation and oppression, the socialist countries are following an unexplored path. This is not always easy; but the laws of social development and the strength of our ideals ensure for the socialist countries a steady advance in all spheres of life.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"54.	Futile are the attempts by certain circles in Western countries to interfere in the internal affairs of the socialist States. Such attempts are being made, in particular, with regard to the Polish People's Republic. No small effort is being made to shake loose the socialist foundations of the Polish State. It will be recalled, in this connection, that the leaders of the States Parties to the Warsaw Treaty made die following statement:",UNGD
RUS,1981,"""It was reiterated that socialist Poland, the Polish United Workers' Party and the Polish people can firmly count on the fraternal solidarity and support the Warsaw Treaty countries.

Washington does not like socialist Cuba, but it may well be asked whether the social system of the United States is to everybody's liking. No one has the right to tell the Cuban people how they should manage their internal affairs.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"57.	In a bid to besmirch the socialist countries, their social system and their peaceful policies, all kinds of fabrications are being resorted to, and those who resort to them seem to be competing with one another as to who can come up with the most preposterous invention. Some even go so far as to predict an early sunset of socialism. 1 wonder how long it took them to find that word ""sunset"". These people seem to be endowed with a remarkable gift of inventiveness, but I must say that they do not seem to have a very good idea of the objective processes of historical development. Are they looking for the sunset in the right country? Is that where they should be looking? Are they not looking in the wrong direction?",UNGD

RUS,1981,"59.	The Soviet Union has never threatened and is not threatening anybody. Since the days of Lenin, peace and friendship among nations have been inscribed on the banner of the Soviet State, and we have invariably been true to this ideal. Today it is as dear to the people of our country as it was in Lenin's day.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"60.	In examining and solving international problems we rely on the ideals of the freedom and progress of nations, on the principles of respect for the independence of all States and all peoples, and aim to consolidate the foundations of life rather than prepare the funeral of mankind.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"61.	There exists, however, another trend in world politics, which has quite different goals. It is the course followed in the militarist circles of imperialist States. The sum and substance of that course is to seek domination over other countries and peoples, a domination that means imposing one's will upon them, their economic exploitation and the use of their territories for military strategic purposes. Washington is ever more frequently heard to speak about the American leadership of the world, though no one has entitled die United States to claim such leadership.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"62.	The architects of that course see as the main instrument for achieving their objectives, the whipping up of international tensions and the use, as they put; it themselves, of methods of force in politics. Even when they occasionally recognize in words the possibility of a diplomatic alternative they hasten to make it clear that diplomacy, unless it relies on force, does not suit them.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"63.	The most typical manifestations of that policy line are: a further whipping up of the arms race; an overt claim to military superiority over the Soviet Union; the setting up of a wide network of military bases and the stationing of American troops on foreign territories; the undermining of the basic principles of SovietAmerican relations worked out earlier as a result of tremendous effort; pressure on other States, particularly in Europe, to curtail their political, trade and economic ties with the socialist countries; and slanderous propaganda against countries adhering to the positions of peace and ejecting claims to world leadership by no matter whom.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"64.	And what great pains are taken to drag the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] allies into following that policy. When arguments are lacking and there is a constant lack of them to support such a hopeless and dangerous course crude pressure is brought to bear, so as to give no respite to those who are not always eager to accept militaristic schemes alien to their interests.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"65.	It is sometimes said that Washington's present policy does not rule out prospects for developing relations between the USSR and the United States. However, in the same breath it is immediately demanded that our country should change neither more nor less its conduct in international affairs to satisfy American interests. In other words, the Soviet Union must give up defending its legitimate interests, give up its foreign policy.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"66.	To put forward such demands is to show a lack of seriousness. The Soviet Union will continue to pursue its course of Leninist peaceful policy. Our country does not intend to deviate from it. We do not encroach on the legitimate interests of others, but nor shall we forgo legitimate interests of our own, including commitments to our allies.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"67.	It is to be hoped that Washington will yet be able to take a more sober view of the actual state of affairs, adopt a more realistic approach to international affairs and not overestimate its capabilities while underestimating the capabilities of others.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"68.	In order to build policy on a realistic basis one should seek, not clashes and conflicts with other countries, even though those other countries have a different social system, but rather the settlement of controversial problems at the negotiating table.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"69.	For our part, we reaffirm once again and the USSR delegation is authorized to say it from this rostrum that the Soviet Union has not sought, nor is it seeking, confrontation with the United States of America. We should like to have normal businesslike relations with the United States. As is known, we are in favor of a dialog in order to seek mutually acceptable solutions to controversial problems. But we are not begging for such a dialog, we are proposing it.",UNGD

At every session of the General Assembly many States emphasize, quite rightly, that the peoples are greatly endangered by the policy of crude interference in the internal affairs of other countries, support for bloodthirsty dictatorial regimes hated by their own peoples and an all out encouragement of oppressors and hatchet-men of every stripe, including the Pol Pot experts in genocide.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"71.	The methods and forms employed in pursuing such a policy are varied. Recently, the United States has all but launched a crusade against international terrorism, leveling accusations against one country after another. These accusations, however, are misdirected. They are utterly false. Terrorism is looked for not where it should be sought and where it really is to be found.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"72.	The scheme here is simple to tag the label of terrorism on the struggle of peoples against colonialism and its vestiges. In other words, it is the policy of oppression, cursed by peoples, which is pictured as a struggle against terrorism. At its basis lies unwillingness to take into account the rights of peoples to manage their domestic affairs as they see fit, and refusal to accept social changes occurring in the world.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"73.	And surely, the events in El Salvador are a fitting illustration of the policy of imperialist interference in the affairs of other peoples. A real massacre has been committed there before the eyes of the whole world. Patriots defending the independence of their country, thousands of peaceful civilians are being killed. It is well known who is in charge there. And all this goes on at the very moment when we are all sitting in session here in the General Assembly Hall.",UNGD

Or take the so called rapid deployment force. Apparently, its formation is regarded in Washington as a great invention. But there is nothing great in it. It is nothing but a policeman's club intended to ensure crude interference by the United States in the affairs of independent States and to stifle the freedom of peoples.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"76.	At this world forum one cannot ignore either the concept of ""American vital interests"" cited in justification of such a policy. This concept is importunately repeated in almost every official statement by Washington on the subject of the international situation. It is interpreted in such a way as to enable the United States to declare any part of the world a sphere of its interests and to take any steps there, all the way up to the use of force.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"77.	Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America, they are all there. It seems that the only area still missing is the South Pole, but it too may soon be added. Everything is there except the right of the United States to do all this. Neither the United States nor any other country has been granted the right to hold sway over the entire globe. This is nothing but arbitrariness.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"78.	As is known, a whole United States naval armada has been assembled in the Persian Gulf. This action is directed against Iran, against the Soviet Union and against a number of independent countries of Asia and Africa. The United States Navy must leave this area. It has nothing to do there, nothing to defend. That would be a sensible act.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"79.	Neither the size nor the power nor the resources of this or that State give it the right to impose by force or threat of force its will on other countries and arbitrarily to declare any part of the world as a sphere of its vital interests. If such a right were to be recognized for any country or group of countries, then, apparently, all instruments of international law should be destroyed. Indeed, little would be left then of the United Nations Charter itself.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"80.	The ruling circles of a number of NATO countries now worship but one god an unrestrained arms race. Everything that serves this end is acceptable to them. This arms race is invariably accompanied by a torrent of speeches and permeated with militarist frenzy, including speeches by top level statesmen. Those who advocate inflated arms programs resort to any means imaginable. Deception is held in special esteem by them. They deceive one another, they deceive the people, they deceive their kin and strangers alike. They launch a rumor and the next day they quote it as the truth.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"81.	The most salient element of deception is the myth of a ""Soviet threat"". It is repeated endlessly, to the point of stupefaction, day and night. In this manner it is easier to confuse people and extort money for armaments. In these conditions decisions are taken on a huge, increase in military expenditures such as history has never before known.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"82.	The urge to expand their military presence wherever possible has now acquired the element of a real Bacchanalia, with half a million United States troops stationed in more than a dozen countries.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"83.	Today the policy of the United States is beset by such an obsession, especially in setting up military bases near the borders of the Soviet Union and the areas adjacent to it. Of course, the States against which these bases are aimed have to take all this into account so as safely to protect their security.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"84.	Who would believe that it is concern for peace that motivates the accelerated pace of the development of ever new types of weapons, including MX intercontinental ballistic missiles, Trident submarine-launched missiles, the new strategic bomber, various types of cruise missiles and many other things?",UNGD
RUS,1981,"85.	What is the purpose of all this? The purpose is to try and upset the established strategic balance, obtain military supremacy and, on this basis, impose one's will upon others.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"86.	The Soviet Union condemns this policy as adventurous. The whipping up of the arms race is madness. This has been repeatedly recognized by many political and public figures in the world, scientists and men of culture. Mankind must be saved from it. The present balance of military power is fully in line with the interests of peace and international stability.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"87.	Our country has never sought, nor is it now seeking, military superiority. Those who make^ claims to the contrary should not be believed.

We shall of course adequately meet any challenge so as to maintain the balance of power.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"88.	However, the Soviet Union has not done, and is not doing, anything beyond what is absolutely necessary to ensure a peaceful life for its people and the security of its allies and friends. We believe that the ruling circles of NATO know all that. Yet, they do not want to admit that there is no Soviet threat whatsoever, nor do they want to give up practicing deception.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"89.	Indeed, what would then be left of exhortations about the need for the notorious ""additional armament of the West""? Nothing would remain. That is the reason why use is made of incomparable indicators and of .falsified data on strategic arms, on medium-range nuclear systems in Europe, on armed forces strength of the two sides in Central Europe or on any other aspect of the correlation of forces.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"90.	If, by any chance, some NATO official happens to concede that the Soviet Union has really never overtaken the United States and that parity is still there, there immediately follows a tongue lashing from above. And then the record of ""Soviet military superiority"" is played again in order to support another increase in military appropriations and to substantiate some freshly baked militaristic doctrine.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"91.	In some capitals such doctrines pop out as if rolling off the assembly line. Things may well reach the stage where any bureaucrat, especially if he is in the spotlight, will, once installed in an executive office, immediately come up with a strategic doctrine of his own concoction. Thus, quite recently, the world was presented with a ""discovery"" according to which nuclear war in general should not be feared too much, that it is ""admissible"" and ""acceptable"". This is a shameless deception designed to mislead the peoples and paralyze their will to struggle against the nuclear threat.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"92.	If the arguments of the proponents of the militaristic policy course are left free of deliberate vagueness and intricacy, and of claims to originality, there remains only one thing, namely, the urge to intensify the arms race, in breadth and in depth, without any restraint.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"93.	But have the authors of these militaristic doctrines asked 500 million Europeans, 470 million Africans, 360 million Latin Americans, 2.5 billion Asians and finally, their own people whether they want to perish in die flames of war? Certainly not. They just do not care.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"94.	The instigators of the arms race would like to discard everything that hampers their plans. If to this end it is necessary to renege on the obligations already assumed, that is what they do. Thus, the United States refuses to ratify the SALT II Treaty.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"95.	Negotiations had been under way for many years before the Treaty was finally agreed upon and signed. Now they say that this Treaty is not to the advantage of the United States and that it is inequitable. Of course, this is not true. The balance of interests of the sides was accurately established and preserved in the Treaty. This is known to anyone familiar with its contents. Therefore, that is not the point. The point is that it is this very principle of equality and equal security reflected in the Treaty which is not to someone's liking.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"96.	Counting on people's ignorance, they seek to sap the Treaty by alleging that it does not envisage strategic weapons reductions. But this is not true either. The Treaty explicitly envisages such reductions, and on a substantial scale,",UNGD
RUS,1981,"97.	It is also obvious that, once agreement has been leached on strategic arms limitation and the initial reduction of their levels, it is easier to solve the task of their more radical redaction so that the balance reflects a lower arms level.",UNGD
RUS,1981,98.	All that convincingly proves that the significance of the Treaty already agreed to and signed is as great today as at the time of its signing.,UNGD
RUS,1981,"99.	How numerous were the cases when talks on the limitation of armaments were held both in the period between the two world wars and after the Second World War. Yet any unbiased person will undoubtedly admit that none of those talks produced results that could be compared even to a small extent to the SALT I agreement, which is in force, and especially to the SALT II Treaty, which has not become operative.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"100.	Now a question arises: why smear both the treaty and the SALT process itself? Yet exceptionally reckless politicians are now saying that the entire problem is not urgent at all, at least not till the United States implements its most sweeping arms buildup plans.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"101.	Just think of the absurdity of such a stand. The nation which claims to be the most powerful in military terms says ""Let me first increase by so many times my armaments and then perhaps I shall talk about their limitation.""",UNGD
RUS,1981,"102.	What is the main factor in such a stand? Is it aggressive designs it) politics, greatPower expansionist ambitions, a striving to impose on the world monstrous plans for an ever greater stockpiling of weapons for the annihilation of people instead of manufacturing things of material goods, or a desire to have an inexhaustible source of excess profits for those who manufacture armaments? It is hard to say. Most likely it is a complex mixture of all these things.",UNGD

RUS,1981,"105.	Washington has long been making attempts to hold back or even to wreck the negotiations initiated earlier on a number of important problems. Unfortunately, quite a lot has already been done to that end. That was the case, for example, with the talks on the Indian Ocean, on limiting conventional arms transfers, on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests, and on the prohibition of the production of chemical weapons and the destruction of their stockpiles.",UNGD
RUS,1981,106.	It is also appropriate to mention here the current efforts to cast aside the results of many years of work by States within the framework of the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea.,UNGD
RUS,1981,107.	Other developments in international life also have their impact on the world situation. Attention is attracted to the ever-increasing closeness between Washington and Peking.,UNGD

In this particular case the basis is openly hostile to many States, above all to the Soviet Union, and hostile to the cause of detente.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"109.	It has been proclaimed to the world that the United States intends to sell weapons to China and to help it build up its military potential. And this is done at a time when Peking is pursuing a policy that runs counter to the interests of peace, a policy of hegemonism and aggression.",UNGD

For its part, the Soviet Union has repeatedly expressed the conviction it was recently reiterated by Leonid Brezhnev from the rostrum of the Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union that the Chinese people's interests would best be served by a policy of peace. The Soviet Union would like to build its relations with the People's Republic of China on a good neighbor basis.

RUS,1981,"112.	These are the main reasons, as we see them, for the recent exacerbation of the international situation.",UNGD

RUS,1981,"114.	The Soviet Union and, we are sure, many other countries hold different views as to the prospects for world developments. Pessimism and a feeling of doom are alien to our nature. We are convinced that to prevent war is not only necessary 'but also possible if this is actively fought for. Hand in hand with all States, our country is prepared to wage the struggle for curbing the arms race, removing the threat of war, settling outstanding problems. In this respect we are not politically allergic to any partner, irrespective of differences in social systems or ideologies.",UNGD

RUS,1981,/,UNGD
RUS,1981,"116.	The Soviet Union proposes that the General Assembly, acting on behalf of all Member States of the United Nations, adopt a declaration solemnly proclaiming that States and statesmen who would be the first to use nuclear weapons would commit the gravest crime against humanity.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"117.	There are and can be no grounds or motives, there are and can be no circumstances or situations which would give a State the right to be the first to use nuclear weapons. It would be a crime against all the peoples, against life itself on earth.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"118.	It is likewise necessary to warn that there will never be any justification or pardon for statesmen who would make the decision on the first use of nuclear weapons. To proclaim this in a declaration so that these words be heard in every capital, in every part of the world, would be to remind statesmen who, by virtue of their official position, are involved in making decisions on the use of nuclear weapons, that each and every one of them is personally responsible for the destinies of mankind.",UNGD
RUS,1981,119.	We propose that the declaration further state loudly and clearly that any doctrines allowing for the first use of nuclear weapons are incompatible with human moral standards and the lofty ideals of the United Nations.,UNGD
RUS,1981,"120.	It is also most important to draw the attention, especially of leaders of nuclear-weapon States, to the fact that their supreme duty is to act in such a way as to eliminate the risk of outbreak of a nuclear conflict.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"121.	The declaration should stress that the nuclear-arms race must be stopped and reversed by joint effort, through negotiations conducted in good faith and cc the basis of equality. What is meant here is that the energy of the atom should be used not against life but for the sake of life, not for the production of weapons but for scientific progress, for improvement of the living standards of people, that is, exclusively for peaceful purposes.",UNGD
RUS,1981,122.	This is the essence of the political document that we are proposing for adoption. We hope that this proposal will meet with wide support.,UNGD
RUS,1981,123.	The adoption of such a document may become a major landmark on the path towards complete elimination of the threat of a nuclear conflict. No single country should stand aside from the solution of this problem.,UNGD

RUS,1981,"125.	From time to time statements are made which seem to express willingness to negotiate. However, attached to this willingness are all sorts of conditions, linkages and unequal approaches of all sorts. If someone really intends to negotiate in this vein, we must say outright: nothing will come of it. Negotiations can be successful only if they are conducted on the basis of Compliance with the principle of equality and equal security.",UNGD

RUS,1981,"Given mutual desire, headway in the solution of this problem can be made, relying on what has already been achieved and preserving the results achieved.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"127.	The SovietAmerican negotiations on the limitation of nuclear weapons in Europe will apparently be resumed unless winds start blowing again in Washington in a different direction. Of course, the question of limiting medium-range nuclear weapons and those of corresponding forward-based nuclear systems of the United States should be examined and settled concurrently and in organic interrelation, with due account of all factors determining the strategic situation on the continent.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"128.	Our country has proposed that the moment negotiations begin, a moratorium should be imposed on the deployment in Europe of new medium-range nuclear missile systems of NATO and the USSR. This proposal is based on the existing approximate parity of their respective armaments. The establishment of a moratorium would certainly exert a favorable influence on the climate of the negotiations.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"129.	The Soviet Union is prepared to reach agreement on limiting and, what is more, on reducing medium-range nuclear systems in Europe. As Leonid Brezhnev stated at Berlin on 6 October 1979:",UNGD
RUS,1981,"""We are prepared to reduce the number of medium range nuclear weapons deployed in western areas of the Soviet Union from their present level, but only, of course, in the event that no additional medium-range nuclear weapons are deployed in Western Europe.""",UNGD
RUS,1981,"130.	At the same time we must make it quite clear that should the other side artificially drag out the negotiations and start to deploy new medium-range nuclear weapons in Western Europe, the Soviet Union will have to take measures to restore the balance.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"131.	For the purpose of strengthening peace in Europe, it is also important to break the deadlock at the Vienna negotiations on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe. The socialist countries have done a good deal to ensure progress at the Vienna negotiations. Should the Western partners show a minimum of goodwill, a solution could be found.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"132.	Of great significance is the question of convening a conference on military detente and disarmament in Europe. As is known, this question is under discussion in Madrid at the meeting of representatives of the States participants in the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"133.	Wishing to contribute to success, the Soviet Union has gone far to accommodate the West and has declared its willingness to include the entire European part of its territory in the zone of confidence-building measures, provided, of course, the Western side makes a corresponding step in turn. What is required now is precisely such a step,",UNGD
RUS,1981,134.	Military detente on the European continent is intended to strengthen and complement political detente. But this does not depend on us alone.,UNGD
RUS,1981,135.	The Soviet Union is prepared to hold negotiations on all areas of limiting the arms race and of disarmament.,UNGD
RUS,1981,"136.	Under current conditions, it is becoming increasingly important to prevent military competition from extending to outer space. Each day brings new evidence that outer space can become an arena of the arms race.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"137.	At* the request of the Soviet Union, an item entitled ""Conclusion of & treaty on the prohibition of the stationing of weapons of any kind in outer space"" has been included in the agenda of the present session [item 128], The Governments of all States represented here have had an opportunity of familiarizing themselves with the Soviet draft of that treaty. The draft takes into account all major aspects of the problem. We would like the exchange of views on the basis of the Soviet Union's proposal and its outcome to be constructive.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"138.	With reference to the need to take measures for curbing the arms race and for disarmament, special note should also be made of the importance of efforts to resolve conflict situations in various parts of the world and to prevent the emergence of new hotbeds of tension. States are capable of coping with this problem provided they strive to ensure a more durable peace.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"139.	The struggle of Arab peoples to defend their legitimate rights, trampled underfoot as a result of Israel's aggression, elicits understanding and support on the part of an overwhelming majority of countries. If justice has not so far been restored and the situation in the Middle East remains dangerous, it is because those in Israel's ruling circles persist in their expansionist policies and do not stop their brutal terror against the people of Lebanon, while influential forces outside that area actually encourage this policy and seek to follow the pattern of the anti Arab Camp David deal,",UNGD
RUS,1981,"140.	Peace and stability in the Middle East can be assured only through a comprehensive political settlement which would not infringe on the rights of any country or people of that region. Such a settlement must envisage the withdrawal of Israeli troops from all Arab territories occupied in 1967 and the exercise of the national rights of the Arab people of Palestine, including the right to establish their own State.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"141.	The Soviet Union consistently comes out in support of the Arabs' rights and stands for the elimination of the consequences of Israeli aggression. There is growing understanding that the path to a Middle East settlement lies through the convening of an international conference with the participation of all the parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO].",UNGD
RUS,1981,"142.	A political settlement is needed for the situation created around the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, against which an undeclared war is still being waged. The principal role in this is played by the United States, and Peking is not far behind.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"143.	Unfortunately. Pakistan, whose territory serves as the main bridgehead for armed incursions, in effect avoids negotiations with the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. Yet, who else but Islamabad should be primarily interested in establishing lasting peace in the region?",UNGD
RUS,1981,"144.	There has been some talk recently about the proposal by certain Western countries to convene an international conference on Afghanistan. But what is striking is that, while the conference is to be on Afghanistan, the main party concerned, the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, has been forgotten. This forgetfulness conceals the attempt to have the internal affairs of Afghanistan, a sovereign nonaligned State, examined in a forum composed of other States, without even the participation of the Afghan Government. Of course that approach is unacceptable.	. ,",UNGD
RUS,1981,"145.	There is a basis for a political settlement; it is simple and, given goodwill, can be translated into reality. A constructive program to this effect was set forth in the statement by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan on 24 August of this year [see AI36/457].",UNGD
RUS,1981,"146.	The political settlement must ensure the termination and non-resumption of armed or other interference in the affairs of Afghanistan. Such a settlement, including reliable international guarantees, would permit the establishment, by agreement between the Afghan and Soviet sides, of modalities and timing for the withdrawal of the limited contingent of Soviet troops from Afghanistan.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"147.	In SouthEast Asia, too, there is no other way but negotiations to reduce tensions in the area. We support the well-known proposals by Viet Nam, the Lao People's Democratic Republic and Kampuchea [see A/36/86, annex I, para. 4], including the proposal to hold a regional conference with the participation of the. countries of IndoChina and the States member's of the Association of SouthEast Asian Nations.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"148.	However, no one should assume that the maneuvers under way around the nonexistent Kampuchean question can result in anything but harm. It is inadmissible that, under the cover of some pseudo-conferences, executioners overthrown by the people of Kampuchea or former princelings should be imposed once again on that people. They have already made their choice.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"149.	Also doomed to failure are the attempts to cast a shadow upon the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, which extended a helping hand to the Kampuchean people in their struggle for freedom and independence.",UNGD
RUS,1981,150.	Attention is drawn to the fraudulent allegation put forward in typical Washington wrappings that someone somewhere in SouthEast Asia used toxic chemical substances said to be of Soviet make. It is quite obvious that at work here are those who are themselves guilty of such crimes. Now they are trying to cover their traces.,UNGD
RUS,1981,"151.	The situation in the Far East, too, offers possibilities for positive political action. One such could be an agreement on the application of confidence-building measures in the region. The implementation of such measures on a collective or a bilateral basis would make a useful contribution to the cause of detente in that region. The Soviet proposal on this question has been communicated to all the States concerned. We expect that in this regard they will display the required sense of responsibility.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"152.	The Korean question still unsettled and thus an old source of tension in the Far East can and must be solved by peaceful means. In our opinion, a suitable basis for solving the problem is provided by the proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea presented by its President Kim II Sung at the Sixth Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea.",UNGD
RUS,1981,153.	Recently the Mongolian People's Republic has taken a timely initiative by proposing a convention on mutual nonaggression and renunciation of force in relations between the States of Asia and the Pacific [see A/36/388]. Our country supports that idea.,UNGD
RUS,1981,"154.	The Republic of India is making a major contribution to maintaining stability and peace in Asia and ensuring international security. We value highly its peaceful constructive policy. SovietIndian relations, which rest on the solid basis provided by the Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Cooperation, are in the interest of our two peoples and positively serve the interests of peace.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"155.	Political means can also be effective in settling other dangerous situations and controversial problems, including the conflict between Iraq and Iran, the Cyprus problem, the situation in Western Sahara and that in the Horn of Africa. The indispensable requirement in this regard is that nobody be allowed to pit one State against another and to capitalize on conflicts between them. There should be no room for imperialist intrigues in those areas.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"156.	As is well known, the South African racist regime and its accomplices are engaged in maneuvers aimed at thwarting the decolonization of Namibia. It is a matter of honor and is the immediate duty of the United Nations to help the people of Namibia gain their freedom. The racists and all those on whom they rely must realize that the time or colonialism is past.",UNGD
RUS,1981,"157.	An end must be put to South Africa's aggressive gangster-like actions against the People's Republic of Angola and a number of other African countries. It is necessary to condemn those actions, to demand that South Africa cease its armed intervention and to adopt international sanctions against it. It is precisely this approach that has recently been manifested by the overwhelming majority of members of the Security Council in voting on a draft resolution submitted by Mexico and other countries.3 However, the United States has prevented the United Nations body from taking inappropriate decision, thus openly defying the African peoples and world public opinion.4",UNGD
RUS,1981,158.	The United States support for South Africa constitutes direct assistance to the aggressor. Such a course must be resolutely condemned. The United Nations should do everything that is needed to put an end to the aggression and call the aggressor to order.

RUS,1982,"Mr. Hollai, allow me to congratulate you on the occasion of your election to the presidency of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly and wish you full success in your most responsible task. We had the opportunity quite recently of complimenting the Secretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, when he visited the Soviet Union and held important talks there. He received a deservedly warm welcome. A session of the General Assembly is a unique opportunity to review the international reality in all its diversity and to sense more profoundly what is of greatest concern to people on different continents. And, one becomes convinced once again that of the multitude of problems in today's world the main problem, the one that stands out, is that of averting the threat of nuclear war. Virtually everyone agrees that world developments have been evolving in an alarming way. People are asking themselves whether the insane arms race can be halted and the slipping towards the abyss prevented. What should be done to counter the policies of those who are playing out various scenarios of nuclear war as if it were some kind of a game of chance rather than a matter that affects the destinies of mankind?",UNGD
RUS,1982,"Those are legitimate questions. The Soviet Union is firmly convinced that peace, which is of the greatest universal value, can and must be preserved; and it must be a just peace, worthy of those heights which civilization on earth has attained. We draw this conviction from history itself, which contains many a tragic page but also examples of brilliantly devised solutions to the most acute international problems. Let us recall how the Charter, which is a universally recognized code of rules that must govern relations between States, came into being. The establishment of this Organization and the Charter crystallized, as it were, the experience of the struggle against and the great victory over fascism. At that time the hope was held out to the world that it would be possible to avert another global tragedy. For almost 40 years now, that hope has been a reality. Now let us look at the changes in international relations brought about in the 1970s, when the peoples of the world were given an opportunity to breathe the air of detente. Surely the differences in social systems and ideologies or in the world outlook were no less then than they are today. But even taking these differences fully into account, States and the leaders who guided their policies did find ways leading to constructive relations between nations. This constant in the experience of peaceful coexistence has taken root in the minds of peoples and in the fabric of inter-State relations, and it is not easy to discard. The urge to give orders to other countries, to dominate the world, must not be allowed to overshadow the experience of the past or muffle the voice of reason.",UNGD
RUS,1982,"	The Soviet people reject the gloomy view that mankind has no other path to follow than building up piles of armaments and preparing for war. It would be a mistake to underestimate the rising menace of war. But it is an even greater mistake to fail to see that possibilities do exist for putting up an insurmountable barrier against war. The Soviet Union and the Soviet people are placing all their political and moral potential and all the prestige of their policy on to the scales of peace. This is surely demonstrated by the obligation unilaterally assumed by the Soviet Union not to be the first to use nuclear weapons, an obligation solemnly stated in the message of Leonid Brezhnev at the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament the twelfth special session [12th meeting]. That was an act of historic importance and it was seen as such throughout the world. Is it not time for our Western partners, the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO], to assess in earnest the opportunities opened up by the Soviet Union's initiative? We expect them to weigh it carefully once again. In seeking to minimize the importance of the Soviet Union's peace initiatives, many Western leaders speak of the need for trust in relations between States. But how would that purpose best be served? It would be best served by renouncing preparations for war, the policy of the arms race and of whipping up world tensions. Why do they not assume the obligation, as the Soviet Union has done, not to be the first to use nuclear weapons? It is sometimes said that it is not merely a question of nuclear weapons alone, for there are conventional weapons as well. Yes, there are. But there is a convincing reply to that, too: we insist that all States assume an obligation to renounce any use or threat of force in their relations. As far back as 1976 the Soviet Union proposed that a world treaty be concluded on the non-use of force in international relations and it submitted a draft treaty to the General Assembly for its consideration. ",UNGD
RUS,1982,"The draft treaty expressly provides that States would refrain from the use of force involving any types of weapons — and I emphasize, any types of weapons. It would be a good idea to inscribe this on the doors of every agency in Washington that is concerned with United States foreign policy. We note with satisfaction that the initiative concerning the non-use of force was endorsed by the overwhelming majority of States Members of the United Nations. Indeed, the Special Committee on Enhancing the Effectiveness of the Principle of Non-Use of Force in International Relations was even established to draft such a treaty. Why, then has no such treaty been worked out? Because State members of NATO are thwarting it. Can the situation be remedied now? Yes, it can. The Soviet Union is prepared even today to come to the negotiating table in order to formalize strict obligations not to use force in settling disputes and differences which exist between States. No one would venture to deny that quite a few such disputes and differences have accumulated. But there are no problems among them that would not lend themselves to peaceful solutions. There are none in any part of the world or in any area of world politics — if, of course, one is motivated by the objectives of peace. It has to be noted, however, that the United States of America has chosen a different policy for itself. The essence of this policy is the desire to impose its will upon other States and peoples. That desire underlies all plans for the production of weapons and underlies United States foreign policy. ",UNGD
RUS,1982,"The Soviet Union has repeatedly drawn attention to the fact that such a policy poses a serious threat to peace. The objective of gaining an edge in armaments has been openly proclaimed in the United States. The idea that it has to be number one militarily has become something of an obsession. Huge sums are being allocated for building up the United States war machine and the pyramid of weapons is getting higher and higher. In the mean time there is continuously at work an assembly line fabricating all kinds of falsehoods about the Soviet Union's armed forces and its foreign policy. People are being deliberately misled. Why is all this being done? Simply because in an atmosphere of lies, hysteria and chauvinistic intoxication it is easier to get astronomical military budgets approved; it is easier to divert the country's resources to war preparations and away from peaceful purposes such as eliminating unemployment and fighting inflation, away from using them for the benefit of people, which is what the Soviet Union is calling for. There is no dearth of versions of nuclear war being planned by the apostles of the arms race: a blitzkrieg, a protracted war, a limited war, an all-out war. Every conceivable and inconceivable definition is being put into circulation. With the cold-blooded composure of grave diggers, they are speculating on the number of casualties each side would sustain in a nuclear catastrophe. They deliberately hush up the fact that if a nuclear war were to break out under present conditions, there would be no winners, and few people today would disagree with that. ",UNGD
RUS,1982,"The Soviet Union has, on a number of occasions, including the sessions of the General Assembly, pointed to the dangerous nature of Washington's course aimed at upsetting the military equilibrium which has evolved between the USSR and the United States of America, and on the whole, between the Warsaw Treaty Organization and NATO. Everywhere, on land and on sea, the United States is seeking to impose or strengthen its military presence and to set up new bases. Look at the bloody orgy that is taking place in the Middle East where a frantic search is under way for new clients to be harnessed to the Pentagon's militaristic strategy. It should, of course, be clear that the Soviet Union does not recognize anyone's fight to military superiority. And it will see to it that that does not happen. One of the principles recognized by the United Nations is non-interference by States in the Internal affairs of other States. It has been reiterated many times in United Nations decisions. However, the world is witnessing today a flagrant flouting of this principle. Who, we might well ask, has given Washington the right to tell sovereign States what they should and what they should not do in their own house? Who has given it the right to try to punish those who cherish their sovereignty and would not yield to pressure, to apply all kinds of sanctions, to impose economic blockades, and even to brandish arms? From what some say, it would appear that United States interests are being endangered almost everywhere in the world. This is an absurd thesis. Yet it is being used to justify crude interference in the affairs of others, used on a sweeping geographic scale, as regards both nearby countries and those situated many thousands of kilometres away from the United States. The Soviet Union has never permitted, nor will it ever allow, anybody to interfere in its internal affairs. This is the stand of the States of the socialist community, as well as of other countries which respect their independence and their legitimate rights. ",UNGD
RUS,1982,"I should like to express the hope that no calls for outside interference in the affairs of other sovereign States will be made from this rostrum either. Otherwise, this high rostrum will cease to be what it is intended to be. And may the United Nations emblem, which is before the eyes of all those present in this Hall, serve as a warning to those who fail to distinguish between what is theirs and what belongs to others. No review of the international scene can overlook the situation taking shape in some regions of the world. In the first place, attention is riveted on the Middle East, for this session of the General Assembly is taking place at a time when ashes have not yet settled in the streets of the ruthlessly destroyed ancient city of Beirut and when the blood of tens of thousands of victims of aggression has not yet been completely absorbed by the soil. An honest people all over the world feel outrage and disgust over the orgy of bloodshed staged by the aggressors in the Palestinian camps in west Beirut where defenceless Palestinians, mostly women, children and old people, were massacred. Could Israel commit aggression and perpetrate genocide against the Palestinians but for its so-called ""strategic consensus"" with the United States? As far as one can judge, in Israel they are now rubbing their hands gleefully. But this is what is called a Pyrrhic victory. The aggression was bound to turn, and has in fact turned, into a serious political and moral defeat for Israel. The rift between Israel and its neighbours has widened. New seeds of hatred and animosity have been sown, and they can bear the grapes of wrath. Those who determine Israel's policies seem to give little thought to the future of their country. And that is too bad, indeed. They are clearly hampered by chauvinistic intoxication. ",UNGD
RUS,1982,"The root cause of the Lebanese tragedy lies in Camp David. It should be clear now to every unbiased person that separate anti-Arab deals only put off the establishment of a just peace in the Middle East. The aggressor and its accomplices say that Camp David means peace. Such an assertion makes a mockery of the profound, humane and noble idea of peace. What kind of peace it makes is evident from the fact that more blood has been shed since Camp David than during the Israeli aggression in 1967. Washington's recent statements, which it is serving up as a Middle East settlement plan, confirm that they are still thinking there in terms of diktat and enmity with regard to the Arabs, rather than in terms of peace. The overwhelming majority of States hold it as a political axiom that there can be no durable peace in the Middle East unless the question of an independent Palestinian State is resolved. The Washington plan, however, states explicitly that the United States is against the creation of such a State. It is widely accepted and recorded in United Nations decisions that the problem of fulfilling the national aspirations of the Palestinians cannot be solved without the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO], whereas the American plan makes no mention at all of the PLO as a party to the settlement. In fact, Washington also fully evades such a fundamental matter as Israel's withdrawal from all the Arab territories seized by it. ",UNGD
RUS,1982,"All decisions taken by the United Nations proceed from the premise that genuine security in the Middle East can only be such as would be common to all States and peoples in that region. The so-called Washington initiative focuses everything on the security of Israel alone, and its interests are made paramount, with the United States itself, naturally, maintaining its arrogant and unjustified claims to a leading role in Middle East affairs. We regard positively the views on a Middle East settlement expressed at the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference at Fez. On the whole these views are on the same lines as those of the Soviet Union regarding a Middle East settlement. ",UNGD
RUS,1982,"As Leonid Brezhnev has recently stressed once again, a just and durable peace in the Middle East can and must be based on the following principles. First, the principle of the inadmissibility of seizure of foreign lands through aggression must be strictly observed. That means that all the territories occupied by Israel since 1967 the Golan Heights, the West Bank of the Jordan river and the Gaza Strip, the Lebanese lands must be returned to the Arabs. The borders between Israel and its Arab neighbours should be declared inviolable. Secondly, the inalienable right of the Arab people of Palestine to self-determination and to the establishment of its own independent State on the Palestinian lands which will be freed from the Israeli occupation on the West Bank of the Jordan river and in the Gaza Strip must be ensured in practice. Palestinian refugees must be given the possibility envisaged in United Nations decisions to return to their homes or be given appropriate compensation for the property they left behind. ",UNGD
RUS,1982,"I ask the following in this connection: has anybody annulled the decision adopted by the United Nations in 1947, which envisages the establishment in the former mandated territory of Palestine of two sovereign States an Arab State and a Jewish State? Nobody has annulled it. Then what are the grounds for talking about the legitimate existence of the Jewish State alone, while impeding in every way the establishment of the other, Arab, State for over three and a half decades? There have been no such grounds, nor are there any now. Thirdly, the eastern part of Jerusalem, which was occupied by Israel in 1967, where one of the main Moslem shrines is located, must be returned to the Arabs and become an inseparable part of the Palestinian State. Freedom of access by believers to the holy places of the three religions must be ensured throughout Jerusalem. Fourthly, the right of all States in the region to a safe and independent existence and development must be ensured, naturally on the condition of full reciprocity, for the security of some cannot be ensured by flouting the security of others. Fifthly, the state of war between the Arab States and Israel must be terminated and peace between them must be established. That means that all parties to the conflict, including Israel and the Palestinian State, must assume an obligation reciprocally to respect the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of each other and to settle the disputes that may arise by peaceful means through negotiations. Sixthly, international guarantees of the settlement must be worked out and adopted. The role of the guarantor could be assumed by, say, the permanent members of the Security Council or by the Security Council as a whole. The path to a durable peace in the Middle East lies through collective efforts by all the parties concerned, including the PLO, and the best way towards this end is to convene an appropriate international conference. ",UNGD
RUS,1982,"For almost two years now bloody hostilities have been going on between Iran and Iraq. This is a senseless war from the point of view of the vital interests of the peoples of the two countries. This conflict is also fraught with grave consequences. The fire should be put out before it spreads farther. The most reasonable thing to do would probably be for Iran and Iraq to put aside arms, to slip covers over the muzzles of their guns and to settle their differences at the negotiating table. ",UNGD
RUS,1982,"The Soviet Union has invariably come out in favour of putting an end to the war between the two States, with which our country has maintained traditional ties, and it is doing all in its power to bring that about. We expect that other major Powers will abandon attempts to take advantage of the conflict. Dangerous scheming is still going on around the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. The foes of the Afghan people, including those who flaunt their commitment to democracy, are trying to hinder the building of a new and truly democratic life in that country. While in words a political solution to the problems which have arisen around Afghanistan is being advocated, in deeds the achievement of such a solution is being impeded in every possible way. Opportunities for such a solution do exist. They are embodied in the constructive proposals of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, which the Soviet Union fully supports. Only one thing is required, and that is to stop the armed intervention from outside against Afghanistan and not interfere in the internal affairs of that sovereign non-aligned State. In the Soviet Union we view as a step in the right direction the start of negotiations in Geneva between representatives of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and Pakistan through a personal representative of the Secretary-General. We fully understand the legitimate concern of the coastal States of the Indian Ocean over the expansion there of the United States military presence. ",UNGD
RUS,1982,"One can literally watch it grow, posing a threat also to the security of the USSR from the south. We cannot but draw our own conclusions from this. The Soviet Union endorses the idea put forward by the non-aligned countries to turn the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace. If it were not for the attempts by certain Powers, above all the United States of America, to frustrate implementation of General Assembly resolution 34/80 B on this matter, an international conference which could be of tangible benefit to the whole of that vast region would have been convened long ago. Even now, without waiting for the conference to be convened, we call upon all the States whose ships use the waters of the Indian Ocean to refrain from any steps that could complicate the situation in that region. This means not sending there large naval formations, not conducting military exercises and not expanding of modernizing military bases of those non-coastal States which possess such bases in the Indian Ocean. One example of the way in which States with different social systems can fruitfully co-operate to mutual advantage and in the interests of universal peace can be seen in Soviet-Indian relations. This co-operation is a concrete and impressive contribution to the cause of security on the South Asian subcontinent and in the international arena as a whole. A new and powerful impulse has been given to it by the results of the recent talks in Moscow between Leonid Brezhnev and the Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi. ",UNGD
RUS,1982,"In another part of the Asian continent, South-East Asia, the Soviet Union supports the efforts aimed at turning that region into a zone of peace. A series of initiatives put forward jointly by Viet Nam, the Lao People's Democratic Republic and Kampuchea opens up prospects for both deepening the dialogue between them and the member ; of the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN] and in general normalizing the situation in the area. These initiatives have been reaffirmed by such a display of goodwill as the partial withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Kampuchea. The peoples of Viet Nam, the Lao People's Democratic Republic and Kampuchea have chosen their own road of social development. In their march along that road they are repelling those forces which are seeking to prevent them from building a new life. The USSR resolutely sides with those States. It is rendering and will continue to render them necessary assistance and support. The Soviet Union is prepared to seek, together with all the Far Eastern States, ways of enhancing the security of that region. Not so long ago we proposed that the time-tested experience gained in carrying out certain measures to build mutual confidence in Europe be considered from the point of view of its application to the Far East. The Soviet Union is ready to discuss this matter in a practical vein with the participation of the People's Republic of China and Japan. For decades now the situation on the Korean peninsula has not been normalized, which increases tensions in the Far East. The Korean problem can and must be settled by peaceful means without any outside interference, as is proposed by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Socialist countries are taking the initiative in strengthening security on a scale embracing the entire Asian continent. This is the intent of the proposal made by the Mongolian People's Republic for the conclusion of a convention on mutual non-aggression and non-use of force in relations between the Asian and Pacific States.",UNGD
RUS,1982," The Soviet Union supports this useful initiative. When a centre of tension appears in some part of the globe there can be no doubt that it is caused by the actions of those who have no regard for the legitimate interests of others. Not infrequently they are inspired by attempts to retain by force positions inherited from the colonial past. One case in point is the South Atlantic. It is to be hoped that the peoples have drawn appropriate conclusions from the recent events in that region. The Soviet Union has on a number of occasions publicly stated its position that a just settlement of the problem that has arisen there can be achieved through negotiations within the United Nations framework and on the basis of United Nations decisions. That continues to be our position today. Another case in point is southern Africa, where the South African racist regime, with the connivance of Western Powers, is actually waging an undeclared war against Angola and some other States of the region. Pretoria has been blatantly defying United Nations decisions on the granting of independence to Namibia. There is no doubt, however, that the Namibian people will attain freedom and independence. ",UNGD
RUS,1982,"Still another case in point is the region of Central America and the Caribbean, where a campaign of pressure and threats is going on unabated against Cuba and Nicaragua, whose only fault is that they want to live according to their own standards. Attempts are being made to portray them as the trouble-makers in that region. Those are attempts made in bad faith. Together with other peoples and States of the Caribbean, Cuba and Nicaragua are in favour of turning it into a zone of peace, independence and development, and the Soviet Union has full sympathy for this goal. Is there anyone who does not know whose advisers and instructors, both uniformed and other-wise, are now in El Salvador, and who rules the roost there, trying to prop up the corrupt and unpopular regime? The USSR has opposed and will continue to oppose such actions. The sympathy and support of the Soviet people are entirely on the side of all the peoples fighting for their freedom and for national and social progress. ",UNGD
RUS,1982,"If there was any lack of evidence that the peoples and States consider the continuing arms race to be one of the most critical issues of our time, the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament has provided such evidence in abundance. Ardent appeals to avert nuclear war and halt the arms race were voiced from its rostrum. The Assembly failed to reach agreement at that session on concrete steps in this field, and it is well known who is responsible for that. Still, the determination of the overwhelming majority of States to ensure peace and achieve disarmament was expressed in no uncertain terms. At that session the Soviet Union submitted a detailed programme of measures to curb the arms race, ranging from nuclear and chemical weapons to limiting conventional weapons and naval activities of States. As has been repeatedly emphasized by Leonid Brezhnev, there is no type of weapon which our country would not be prepared to limit or ban on the basis of reciprocity. And if the accumulation of arms is not only continuing but accelerating, if this tragic competition is proceeding at a pace that leaves behind accords on arms limitation, and if the agreements already reached in this field are called into question, all this is the direct result of the United States policy aimed at building up its military muscle. It makes no secret of this policy line; indeed, it is bragging about it. ",UNGD
RUS,1982,"To take a problem such as the limitation and reduction of strategic arms, that is, the most destructive weapons, the problem which is of utmost importance under present-day conditions, there had been many delays on the part of our partners before the Soviet-American talks started. Undoubtedly, the fact that they are being held is in itself of positive significance. But Chat alone is not enough. What is required is the desire on both sides to seek agreement. Without going into the details of the talks, it should, however, be emphasized that so far the other side has failed to show the desire to come to agreement. Surely one cannot take for such a desire the attempt to single out from the totality of weapons possessed by the USSR and the United States only those types of weapons in this particular case land- based missiles which constitute the backbone of the Soviet Union's strategic potential, and to make them alone the subject of reduction, leaving out all the rest, that is, submarine-launched missiles, strategic bombers and cruise missiles, where the United States preponderance is obvious. Certainly this lopsided approach promises no hope for the success of the negotiations. The principle of the equality and equal security of the sides must remain their unshakable foundation. Accuracy, science, balance of parameters, together with a careful evaluation of all elements of the problem — all these must be taken into account. There must be no room for deception, guile or juggling with facts, either in large or in small doses. It should be recalled that the Soviet Union has put forward an important proposal, namely, to agree to freeze the strategic armaments of the USSR and the United States quantitatively as soon as the talks begin, and at the same time to restrict their modernization to the utmost. We have proposed that for the duration of the talks the sides should take no actions that might upset the stability of the strategic situation. That is our concrete response to the mounting feeling in many countries of the world in favour of a freeze on the existing levels of nuclear arms, to be followed by their drastic reduction, which is advocated by the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, those who are conducting negotiations with us on this problem shudder at the mere words ""a freeze on arms"". ",UNGD
RUS,1982,"What has actually been frozen on their side, and quite deeply at that, is the realization that the talks must be frank, in good faith and free from any lopsidedness. What is the state of affairs at the Soviet-American talks on the limitation of nuclear arms in Europe? Sometimes encouraging statements are heard from the United States side in this respect. But this is an assumed optimism. The so-called zero option — or, to be more precise, pseudo-zero option proposed by the United States does not offer a solution to the problem. It provides for the elimination only of Soviet land-based missiles, including those which the Soviet Union has possessed for over 20 years now. As to the medium-range nuclear forces of NATO, they are not to be subject to reduction by a single unit and can even be built up. We have no doubt that Washington realizes that the Soviet side would not agree to a one-sided solution that would run counter to the security interests of the USSR and its allies. Therefore, what is doubtful is whether Washington is really seeking an agreement. ",UNGD
RUS,1982,"The Soviet Union's desire to come to agreement with the United States is buttressed by practical steps. As is well known, it has unilaterally discontinued further deployment of medium-range missiles in the European part of the USSR. And, what is more, ii is carrying out the reduction of a part of that force. Finally, we are not stationing any additional medium- range missiles beyond the Urals, from where Western Europe would be within their reach. The Soviet Union has faithfully kept its word in this matter too. Throughout the post-war period, since the emergence of the first atom bombs, the Soviet Union has been persistently seeking approaches to putting an end to the nuclear arms race. At that time it was much easier to ban the atomic weapon than it is nowadays, when there exists a huge arsenal of nuclear armaments. But even today this problem can be resolved. Mankind has no other reasonable option but to reduce the nuclear threat gradually though consistently, step by step, and ultimately eliminate it. In this context, it is extremely important to erect a barrier against the development of ever new types and systems of nuclear weapons a process which tends to destabilize the strategic situation for it entails the emergence of weapons which, because of their characteristics, would hardly lend themselves to verification. If this is so, the working out of relevant international agreements on their limitation and reduction is becoming more difficult. That is the reason why it is becoming increasingly urgent to stop nuclear-weapons tests and to erect a tangible physical barrier to the development of ever new kinds of nuclear weapons and thus slow down the arms race. The States of the world, with very few exceptions, demand a ban on all nuclear-weapon test explosions in all environments and for all times. Their will was reflected in a series of decisions adopted at the United Nations. ",UNGD
RUS,1982,"Moreover, when signing the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, all the parties to it, including the United States, undertook to do away with nuclear-weapon tests for good. In our view, it is the direct responsibility of the United Nations to demand that all countries, and the nuclear Powers in the first place, do their utmost to achieve that goal. As a nuclear Power, the Soviet Union declares that for its part, it is ready to do that. We propose the inclusion in the agenda of this session of an important and urgent item entitled ""Immediate cessation and prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests"". What is proposed specifically? It is proposed to speed up the working out and signing of a treaty on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear- weapon tests and to put the talks on that subject in the Committee on Disarmament on a practical footing. The Soviet Union is submitting to the Assembly for its consideration ""Basic provisions of a treaty on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear- weapon tests"" [see A/371243], a document which takes into account the measure of agreement reached during the discussion of that problem in recent years. It also takes into account the views and suggestions advanced by many States, inter alia on questions of verification. In order to create more favourable conditions for the elaboration of the treaty, we propose that all nuclear-weapon States declare a moratorium on all nuclear explosions, including peaceful ones, as of a date to be agreed upon among them. Such a moratorium would be effective pending the inclusion of the treaty. ",UNGD
RUS,1982,"In the context of the problem of the complete and general prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests, I wish to single out two more aspects of importance. First, the Soviet Union is prepared at any time to ratify — on a reciprocal basis — the treaties concluded with the United States on the limitation of underground nuclear-weapon tests and on nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes. Secondly, we are in favour of the resumption of the trilateral talks between the USSR, the United States and the United Kingdom. Those talks were under way. Then they were broken off, and it is public knowledge who was responsible for that. In the context of the struggle to lessen the nuclear threat, there is still another important problem to which the Soviet Union would like to draw the Assembly's attention. The number of non-military nuclear facilities, above all power installations, is increasing in various countries. This is an inevitable process, which is bound to grow in scope in the future. However, intentional destruction, even with the help of conventional weapons, of atomic power plants, research reactors and other similar installations might cause the release and dissemination of a huge amount of radioactive substances, which would have fatal consequences for the population. In other words, it would be tantamount in its effect to a nuclear explosion. ",UNGD
RUS,1982,"As calculated by experts, the consequences of the destruction of a large atomic power plant are comparable to the radioactive contamination occurring after the explosion of a one-megaton nuclear bomb. Therefore, the need for ensuring a safe development of nuclear energy is closely linked with the task of preventing the unleashing of nuclear war. Being desirous of lessening the nuclear threat in this area, too, the Soviet Union proposes the inclusion in the agenda of this session of an urgent item entitled ""Multiplying efforts to eliminate the threat of nuclear war and to ensure a safe development of nuclear energy"". ",UNGD
RUS,1982,"The Soviet Union proposes that the General Assembly declare the destruction of peaceful nuclear facilities with conventional weapons equivalent to an attack involving the use of nuclear weapons that is to say, it should equate such destruction with those actions which the United Nations has already qualified as the gravest crime against humanity. The question of a speedy elimination of chemical weapons presents itself in all its magnitude. This weapon is one of the means of mass annihilation. The unrestrained build-up of chemical weapons in the West, far from enhancing anybody's security, is only aggravating the risk of military conflicts with the use of these lethal weapons. The Soviet Union has consistently been advocating the exclusion of chemical weapons from the arsenals of States. The relevant proposals submitted by it have been referred to the Committee on Disarmament. We hope that its members will proceed, with all due sense of responsibility, to the elaboration of an international convention on the prohibition and elimination of these barbaric weapons. There is an increasing danger that the arms race will acquire a qualitatively new dimension unless the necessary measures are urgently taken. Washington is now planning a military thrust into outer space. We are convinced that the arms race must not be permitted to spread into the boundless expanses of outer space. The United Nations can and must play its part in this respect. ",UNGD
RUS,1982,"For a number of years now the Soviet Union has been seeking the conclusion of an international treaty prohibiting the stationing of weapons of any kind in outer space. The expanses of outer space should be an area only for the peaceful co-operation of States. A separate question and a major one is the reduction of conventional armaments and of the numerical strength of armed forces. The Soviet Union wishes to see this problem, too, firmly integrated into the fabric of international negotiations and agreements. In relation to Central Europe, these problems are under discussion at the Vienna Talks on Mutual Reduction of Forces, Armaments and Associated Measures in Central Europe. For nine years now, these talks have been, figuratively speaking, marking time, and the time to find agreements that would ameliorate the situation in an area with the highest concentration of the opposing armies is long overdue. ",UNGD
RUS,1982,"The Soviet Union and its Warsaw Treaty allies are doing their utmost to achieve that. It is a favourite allegation in the West that the Warsaw Treaty countries are superior to NATO in terms of conventional armaments in Europe. Yet at the Vienna talks the socialist countries are proposing to establish for both sides equal levels of armed forces stationed in Central Europe. Unfortunately, the conduct of our Western partners in the negotiations is not conducive to reaching such an agreement. Although some rouge, figuratively speaking, has recently been applied to their position, the essence has remained unchanged. So what is left of the so-called concern of the Western countries regarding the alleged superiority of the Warsaw Treaty over NATO? And what is worse, steps are being taken out-side the framework of the talks, which can only be described as provocative. What is there to say, for instance, about the recent agreements between the Federal Republic of Germany and the United States concerning the bringing from overseas of additional contingents of American troops under far-fetched pretexts? In other words, instead of reducing forces in that region, conditions are being prepared for increasing them by several more divisions. That is, of course, a mockery of common sense. ",UNGD
RUS,1982,"The same applies to the planned redeployment of United States military units to the immediate vicinity of the borders of the German Democratic Republic. In Europe, as well as on other continents, the Soviet Union is countering the policy of confrontation with the policy of good-neighbourliness and co-operation. We understand and appreciate the desire of the Europeans to follow the path opened up by the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. There exists a possibility of further progress towards making Europe a continent of peace and stability. The attainment of this goal would be largely facilitated by the implementation of the idea of convening a conference on confidence-building measures and disarmament in Europe. That is one of the principal issues at the Madrid meeting of the States participants in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. If all its participants adopt a constructive approach at its resumed session in November, general agreement could be reached both with regard to the convening of the conference and to ensuring the success of the Madrid meeting. Seeking to alleviate tension throughout the world, we have recently proposed that the decision-making bodies of NATO and the Warsaw Treaty Organization make declarations on the non-extension of the sphere of action of the two military and political groupings to Asia, Africa and Latin America. That would constitute a major step towards detente. ",UNGD
RUS,1982,"All the members of the Warsaw Treaty support this proposal. We hope that the NATO countries will study this proposal and respond to it in a positive manner.	In recent years serious obstacles have emerged in restructuring international economic relations on a democratic and equal basis. The root cause lies in the policies of certain Western Powers aimed at keeping the developing countries in an unequal position, at facilitating the attempts of the monopoly capital to exercise its sway over those countries. A recent vivid example of that is the attitude of some Western Powers to the enormous work accomplished by States in preparing the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Many years of effort have produced a document whose provisions do not prejudice anybody's interests. And what has become of it? The United States is hampering the adoption of that convention. We would like to express the hope that it will stop being in opposition to a vast majority of States and will adhere to the convention.",UNGD
RUS,1982,"	The USSR is in favour of democratization of both political and economic relations between States. As to our participation in rendering assistance to the newly freed States in overcoming their economic backwardness, in this respect to the Soviet Union is doing at least as much if not more than any of the developed capitalist countries. It is common knowledge that the foreign policy course of any State is an extension of its domestic policy. Our country sets itself economic and social tasks of vast magnitude. We need peace to accomplish them. The Soviet Union is extending its hand to every State which, for its part, is willing to maintain and develop good relations with us. That applies to Europe. We are prepared for a further expansion of co-operation with Western European countries on a peaceful and mutually beneficial basis. That applies to Asia, where the Soviet Union has long-standing and stable ties with many States. That applies to Latin America, where normal, business like relations are being established between the USSR and a number of countries, including Mexico, Brazil and Argentina. The same applies to the United States of America. We are convinced that from the viewpoint of a long-term policy of principle the deterioration of relations between the USSR and the United States is not in the interests of the United States itself. The American people is hardly different from other peoples as far as the desire to live in peace is concerned. Our country has on several occasions pronounced itself - in particular at the Congresses of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and at the USSR Supreme Soviet — in favour of developing normal relations with the United States. The policy of the Soviet Government aimed at preserving and strengthening peace and preventing another war is endorsed by all Soviet people, since all they aspire to is a peaceful — and only peaceful — future. At the end of this year the Soviet people will mark an important event the sixtieth anniversary of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The Land of the Soviets is invariably faithful to the peaceful behests of the founder of our State, V. I. Lenin. As Leonid Brezhnev has recently stressed once again, ""concern for peace is paramount in the policy of the Soviet Union"". This concern determines the fundamental direction of all foreign policy activities of the Soviet State, which are based on the Programme of Peace for the 1980s adopted by the twenty-sixth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. This Programme is being implemented by the Soviet Union together with other countries of the socialist community, cemented together as they are by a common political system and world outlook, by the identity of goals and ideals. ",UNGD
RUS,1982,"All the activities of socialist countries convincingly prove that peace is their policy aim. Every step, every foreign policy move made by them, serves the attainment of that noble goal. The Soviet Union has rebuffed and will continue to rebuff policies based on the cult of force. Those who come out for preventing a nuclear disaster and for strengthening peace can always count on its support and co-operation. All our actions in the international arena will continue to be inspired by our deep-held belief in the necessity and the possibility of saving the present and succeeding generations from the scourge of war.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"58.		First of all, allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the important post of President of this session of the General Assembly. Your wealth of experience, including your profound knowledge of the Organization, is an excellent guarantee of the effectiveness of the work of the General Assembly.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"59.	I should like to take this opportunity to convey our gratitude to our friend and comrade Mr. Imre Hollai, the representative of the fraternal Hungarian People's Republic, for his skilful conduct of the proceedings of the General Assembly last year.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"60.	We would also like to welcome the entry into the United Nations of a new State, Saint Christopher and Nevis.",UNGD
RUS,1983,61.	There are today 158 Member States of the United Nations. It is worth recalling that this reality of the contemporary international scene has quite a definite political meaning.,UNGD
RUS,1983,"62.	The solution to the crucial problem—the problem of war and peace—depends precisely on the States Members of the United Nations, on the way they construct relations among themselves and on the way they act in the world arena.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"63.	Under the Charter of the United Nations these States have pledged to ""live together in peace with one another as good neighbours"".",UNGD
RUS,1983,64.	If only all of them abided by that Charter provision It would not then be necessary so vehemently to voice the urgent need to defend peace and to dispel the storm clouds gathering over it.,UNGD
RUS,1983,65.	That is what the Soviet Union is once again doing today.,UNGD
RUS,1983,"66.	Our planet is practically caving in under the unprecedented burden of arms with unheard-of destructive power. Should it happen that those arms are actually used, the very survival of human civilization will be in question.",UNGD
RUS,1983,67.	The situation is compounded by the fact that the forces heating up the international atmosphere in order to further their pathological ambitions have now sharply intensified their activities.,UNGD
RUS,1983,"68.	The reckless actions of those forces, combined with the enormous potential of lethal weapons, have produced, figuratively speaking, an explosive mixture which has added an entirely new dimension to the threat to peace.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"69.	Given the present situation, the task of preventing war has now acquired particular urgency.",UNGD
RUS,1983,70.	At a time when all mankind is threatened with a nuclear catastrophe it is the duty of all those who have anything to do with the political decision-making process to put concern for peace above all else.,UNGD
RUS,1983,"71.	This is what the peoples of the world are entitled to demand of their political leaders, their Governments and parliaments and, of course, international organizations, above all the United Nations, which is designed to be ""a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations"" in maintaining international security.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"72.	On all continents the people's anti-war movement is growing and its activities in the struggle to preserve peace are increasing. This is only natural, for people cannot and will not live today in a permanent state of anxiety about tomorrow.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"73.	The course pursued by some Members of the Organization is contrary to the age-old human yearning for a peaceful life embodied in the purposes and principles of the Charter and to the interests of the peace-loving majority of States. The credo of the architects of this course is revealed by the Washington-imposed decisions of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization bloc. Their policy is aimed at achieving military superiority, a vantage point from which they wish to dominate and dictate to others.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"74.	It would appear that the nuclear arsenals of the United States and NATO are filled to capacity, and yet the assembly lines continue to chum out military hardware in a kind of frenzy. Every item of military hardware that exists is being either increased or replaced by another even more destructive.",UNGD
RUS,1983,75.	Armaments programmes costing many billions are being approved one after another. Whatever objections are raised—and they are being raised in this regard by sober-minded politicians and authoritative public figures in the United States itself—the United States Administration has but one thing to say: there is not the slightest doubt that we must arm and preferably two or three times over.,UNGD
RUS,1983,"76.	There have been fierce clashes over deployment of the MX strategic missile and, indeed, as to whether it is necessary at all, but the decision was both to deploy the MX and to develop the Minuteman—yet another intercontinental missile.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"77.	There were arguments over whether or not to build the B-l bomber. The decision was to go ahead with two new types of strategic bomber, at the same time.",UNGD
RUS,1983,78.	Other kinds of nuclear and other systems are also being put into mass production. The barbaric neutron weapon and new chemical weapons are being stockpiled. Next on the list is the development of systems for waging warfare in and from outer space.,UNGD
RUS,1983,"79.	Under the pretext of an alleged shortage of nuclear weapons in areas where they already exist, attempts are being made to add to them, and where they do not exist, attempts are being made to deploy them.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"80.	The intention has been expressed to move nuclear weapons as close as possible to the borders of the Soviet Union and its allies, to introduce into Western Europe new American medium-range missiles, that is to say Pershing II and cruise missiles.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"81.	To the south and to the east the land and waters are also being saturated with nuclear weapons. A11 this is taking place over a wide geographic area, from Diego Garcia to Okinawa, across the vast expanse of the Indian Ocean and the Pacific.",UNGD
RUS,1983,82.	In order to justify the unchecked escalation of their militaristic preparations they are deliberately whipping up war hysteria and do not stop short of staging the crudest provocations.,UNGD
RUS,1983,"83.	We, for our part, have already set forth our view, based on principle, of the incident involving the intrusion of the South Korean aircraft into Soviet airspace.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"84.	It is impermissible for anyone to infringe the sovereignty of States, and this includes the inviolability of their borders. This is a universally recognized rule of international law and is fully consistent with the Charter of the United Nations. Anyone that attempts to violate our borders must know that he will have to bear the full responsibility.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"85.	We have expressed our regret at the loss of human life. The initiators of this anti-Soviet act of provocation are entirely to blame for this tragedy. No matter what scurrilous slander or dishonest devices they resort to, they will never be able to cover up their tracks and conceal the true aims of their crime.",UNGD
RUS,1983,86.	To the impartial observer there cannot and should not be the slightest doubt as to the nature of these aims. An act of sabotage against peace was committed to further militaristic policies and the inflation of military budgets.,UNGD
RUS,1983,87.	In an attempt to change in their own favour the military-strategic situation in the world they invoke the security interests of the United States and its allies.,UNGD
RUS,1983,"88.	It is the right and duty of each country to protect its own security, just as it is its right and duty to work for the strengthening of universal peace.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"89.	But nowadays international and national security are interrelated to a greater extent than ever before. Neither can be reliably ensured when the United States and NATO are spurring the arms race and pursuing a policy based on a ""position of strength"".",UNGD
RUS,1983,"90.	Such a policy, however it may be packaged, is the exact opposite of a policy which ensures international security.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"91.	Certain quarters in the United States have become partial to ringing phrases. Of late a formula that has gained currency at the highest level is ""peace through strength"", which means, of course, the strength of the United States. This has been proclaimed as its policy.",UNGD
RUS,1983,92.	In both ancient and modern history there have been quite a few attempts to be the strongest and to rule the world. It is common knowledge how these all ended.,UNGD
RUS,1983,93.	Through costly experience mankind has distilled a different notion of what should be the basis of peace and security: the renunciation of the threat or use of force and peaceful co-operation among States. That is what inspired the creation of the United Nations. That is the one and only foundation upon which peace can rest.,UNGD
RUS,1983,"94.	The myth of the ""Soviet threat"", invented to deceive the peoples, is being used on a particularly wide scale today. In his own time V. I. Lenin aptly characterized those who ""shout about red militarism . . . pretend that they believe this absurdity and throw charges of this kind right and left"", making use of their ""skill in concocting false arguments and in throwing dust in the eyes of the masses"".",UNGD
RUS,1983,95.	Since the Great October Revolution peace and friendship among peoples has been the sign of our socialist State. We remain faithful to that sign.,UNGD
RUS,1983,"96.	There has been a great deal of talk about the USSR being ""excessively armed"" and having military superiority. It has been claimed that the West needs to dose the existing gap. Yet the facts—and the West is just as well aware of them as we are—confirm beyond doubt that in all areas—strategic nuclear arms, medium-range weapons in Europe, the conventional armed forces of NATO and of the Warsaw Treaty—there is approximate equality between the two sides.",UNGD
RUS,1983,97.	Statements about national security interests are riddled with falsehoods. They are turned inside-out so that those interests conflict with the security interests of other countries and peoples.,UNGD
RUS,1983,"98.	Those who like to hold forth about the sanctity of international obligations and to preach morality in relations among States are violating elementary norms of decency, showing disrespect not only for statesmen and States but also for the United Nations. Moreover, as was pointed out in a recent statement by Mr. Andropov, this question as to whether this international Organization, whose task it is to maintain peace and security, can be located in a country in which an unbridled militaristic psychosis is spreading and the good name of the Organization is being insulted.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"99.	The contenders for the role of master of the destinies of the world brazenly proclaim as a sphere of their vital interests any particular area of the world they take a fancy to, an area perhaps that is even thousands of miles away from the United States. They are prepared to stake such claims all over the globe.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"100.	Thus, the sphere of the United States ""vital interests"" includes for example, the Middle East, where new anti-Arab deals and designs violating the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people are being pushed through. Step by step the United States is forcing its presence, including its military presence, on that region.",UNGD
RUS,1983,101.	Israel is being encouraged to continue its policy of aggression. Tel Aviv has absolutely no wish to end its adventure in Lebanon. Palestinian refugees in that country are being subjected to acts of genocide. Lebanon has been forced into accepting a capitulation agreement. Attempts are being made to turn the State of Lebanon into a United States-Israeli protectorate and virtually to dismember that country.,UNGD
RUS,1983,102.	Constant pressure is being exerted on Syria to make it change its steadfast course in Middle East affairs.,UNGD
RUS,1983,"103.	As a result, the Middle East continues to be a focal point of the danger of war, while a peaceful settlement remains out of reach. All this is damaging to both the vital interests of the peoples of the region and the interests of international security.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"104.	The Soviet Union consistently advocates the elimination of the consequences of the Israeli aggression, supports the legitimate rights of the Arab peoples, including the right of the Arab people of Palestine to establish a State of their own, and advocates a just and comprehensive settlement and the convening of an international conference on the Middle East with the participation on an equal footing of all the parties concerned, including the PLO, the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"105.	The hegemonistic policy of ""vital interests"" is well matched by the tools used to implement it. They include the ""central command"" set up to carry out interventionist operations against almost 20 sovereign States in the Middle East, in South-West Asia and on the African continent.	",UNGD
RUS,1983,"106.	The ""rapid deployment force"", whose mission is to prevent internal changes in various countries if such changes are not to Washington's liking, is in a constant state of readiness. It can be said that the creation of such forces has become a vogue among NATO powers. The events in Chad show where this can lead.",UNGD
RUS,1983,107.	What about the extensive worldwide network of United States military bases? They too are being equipped for use against peoples and countries fighting for their freedom and defending their sovereignty. The areas where this struggle is going on are being surveyed for sites for new military bases.,UNGD
RUS,1983,"108.	Aircraft carriers and battleships are being dispatched to the shores of those who are unwilling to submit to foreign diktat. Modern ""gunboats"" ply the waters off the coasts of many independent countries.",UNGD
RUS,1983,109.	Libya has been chosen as a target for a show of force in the Mediterranean.,UNGD
RUS,1983,110.	A United States armada is stationed in the Indian Ocean. It is no accident that Washington is opposed to the proposal of the non-aligned countries to turn that region into a zone of peace and is impeding the convening of an international conference on the Indian Ocean.,UNGD
RUS,1983,"111.	The Soviet Union cannot ignore the threat to its security emanating from that quarter, especially since the United States has broken off and refuses to resume the Soviet-American talks on the limitation and subsequent curtailment of military activities in that region. Our country has been and remains in favour of the withdrawal from that area of all naval forces not belonging to the littoral States and supports the idea of creating a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"112.	Large United States naval contingents are concentrated off Central American countries, along both the Atlantic and the Pacific coasts. Land and air forces are being concentrated.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"113.	The purpose of all this must be clear to everyone. The whole policy of the United States serves but one purpose: that of containing the liberation movement of the peoples, to obstruct the process of the strengthening of national independence and democratic change in Latin American countries.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"114.	At the same time the United States authorities dismiss the very idea that they assume the overt role of policeman. They prefer to call it ""assistance to fiends"". Yet their friends include anti-popular regimes steeped in blood and infamy.",UNGD
RUS,1983,115.	They are shielding the military junta in El Salvador from the wrath of the people by supplying it generously with money and weapons. They are sending their military advisers there to supervise repressive operations being carried out by the puppet regime.,UNGD
RUS,1983,"116.	Brutal pressure is being brought to bear on Nicaragua, whose people have taken a strong stand in favour of the progressive development of their country. Nicaragua is being threatened from the sea, gangs of mercenaries and pirate aircraft are infiltrated into its territory, and neighbouring States are incited to hostility against it.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"117.	Washington will not succeed in concealing the fact that it is organizing aggression against Nicaragua, thus posing a threat to peace in Central America and exacerbating the international situation in general.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"118.	No amount of demagoguery about the  'scheming of Moscow and Havana"" will hide the true causes of the growth of the liberation movement in the countries of the region: imperialist oppression and the poverty of the masses. Do they really expect anyone to swallow their bait? Latin America and the world at large are fully aware of the actual state of affairs.",UNGD
RUS,1983,119.	Washington does not like the fact that the Cuban people are following the path of socialism they themselves have chosen. Cuba's independent policy and its role in the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries go against the grain. Cuba is being subjected to open threats and subversive actions.,UNGD
RUS,1983,120.	Interference in the internal affairs of Central American States must be unconditionally stopped. The proposals put forward by Nicaragua and supported by Cuba open up the possibility of easing tensions and bringing about a political solution of the existing problems. The course pursued in particular by Mexico and other countries of the Contadora Group also appears to be positive in that respect.,UNGD
RUS,1983,121.	There has been much effort to make things look as if the current aggravation of the international situation dates back to well-known events in Afghanistan.,UNGD
RUS,1983,122.	One might assume that even those who were inclined to take that assertion on trust are now beginning to see through its absurdity. The enemies of the Afghan people will not reconcile themselves to the fact that the Afghan people have decided to rid themselves of medieval darkness and have begun building a democratic society.,UNGD
RUS,1983,"123.	The situation around Afghanistan—and I am stressing the external aspects of the problem—can be settled on the basis of the proposals made by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, which proposals the Soviet Union fully supports. Military incursions into Afghanistan as well as any outside interference in its affairs, must be stopped.",UNGD
RUS,1983,124.	The talks being conducted through the representative of the Secretary-General are of positive significance. They would be more fruitful if the Pakistani side were to display greater political foresight.,UNGD
RUS,1983,"125.	The policy pursued by outside forces is behind the aggravation of the situation in South-East Asia. That policy is aimed primarily against Viet Nam, Laos and Kampuchea, whose peoples are defending their independence and are engaged in building a new and peaceful life. There have been persistent attempts to pit against the countries of Indo-China their neighbours, the States of the Association of South-East Asian Nations.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"126.	The Soviet Union has been and remains on the side of the people of Viet Nam, Laos and Kampuchea. We support the proposals to turn South-East Asia into a zone of peace, good-neighbourliness and co-operation, and we support the initiatives of the three countries of Indo China to open a political dialogue among the States of the region. ",UNGD
RUS,1983,127.	Those who are blowing the so-called Kampuchean question out of proportion are not acting in good faith. The people of Kampuchea have chosen the political system for their country and they themselves choose the ones to make friends with and to rely upon.,UNGD
RUS,1983,"128.	Alarming shifts are taking place in the policy of Japan, whose ruling circles seem to be pleased with the role currently assigned to it as NATO's partner in the Far East. The accelerated militarization of that country adds to tensions in the Far East.",UNGD
RUS,1983,129.	This policy can hardly be in the interests of Japan itself and it certainly does not help Japan to develop good relations with neighbouring States.,UNGD
RUS,1983,"130.	Our country stands for the development of Soviet- Japanese relations on the basis of the principles of good- neighbourliness and cooperation, but of course this presupposes reciprocity.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"131.	The fact that the Korean question remains unresolved does not enhance the stability of the situation in the Far East. The proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea providing for the withdrawal of United States troops from South Korea and the creation of the conditions for the reunification of that country by peaceful means, without outside interference, offer a suitable basis for the settlement of this question. The USSR is in sympathy with this position and supports it.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"132.	With the connivance of Western Powers and in the shelter of their neo-colonialist policies, the racist regime of Pretoria has been making aggressive moves against neighbouring States in southern Africa. These include, primarily, the undeclared war being waged against the People's Republic of Angola. Such criminal acts should be condemned and stopped.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"133.	The United Nations and the Security Council must bring to bear the weight of their authority in favour of the early decolonization of Namibia, which is still being blocked by South Africa and its protectors. We are confident that the Namibian people will throw off the fetters of colonialism and win freedom and independence for their country, under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization their patriotic vanguard.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"134.	The people of Micronesia, which the United States is unlawfully attempting to hold on to and to convert into a United States military springboard in the western Pacific, are entitled to express their will freely.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"135.	Britain is pursuing a course aimed at the entrenchment of the colonial status and the militarization of the Falkland (Malvinas) Islands, while refusing to negotiate in accordance with the decisions of the United Nations.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"136.	A consistently realistic analysis leaves no doubt that the source of the increasingly alarming trends in the international situation resides, as pointed out in a recent statement by Mr. Y. V. Andropov, in the militaristic policy of 6he United States, which is posing a grave threat to peace. The essence of that policy is to try to ensure dominant positions in the world for the United States without taking into account the interests of other States and peoples and to block and reverse the objective process of the world's development.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"137.	Such a policy is bound to destabilize the world situation still further and to disrupt normal relations among States. Indeed, what guarantee is there that such an adventurist course will not have irreparable consequences?",UNGD
RUS,1983,138.	The conclusion that must follow is that practical steps are needed to prevent the worst from happening. The dangerous shift in world developments must be redressed so as to bring about an improvement in international relations.,UNGD
RUS,1983,139.	The Soviet Union and the countries of the socialist community are doing everything in their power to achieve that goal.,UNGD
RUS,1983,"140.	The socialist society, as one which is confident of its creative potential, has no need of an arms race or war. It has demonstrated and will continue to demonstrate its advantages in the process of peaceful competition with capitalism, and it is our conviction that the future belongs to socialism.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"141.	However, we do not seek to impose our world view on anyone, and we believe that ideological differences should not be allowed to affect relations among States. This is a behest of Lenin, and our country will continue to abide by it.",UNGD
RUS,1983,142.	In his statement of 28 September Mr. Andropov said:,UNGD
RUS,1983,"""The transfer of ideological contradictions to the sphere of inter-state relations has never benefited the one who resorted to it in external affairs. This is simply absurd and inadmissible at present, in the nuclear age. Transformation of the battle of ideas into military confrontation would be too costly for the whole of mankind."" ",UNGD
RUS,1983,Those forces in the United States and some other NATO countries which shape their foreign policies shrink from nothing in painting a distorted picture of the international situation and laying the responsibility for the exacerbation of that situation at the door of the Soviet Union.,UNGD
RUS,1983,"143.	Every possible propaganda means has been mobilized to that end. Statements have been pouring forth in torrents from platforms large and small, spewing out uncivilized invective and insults. That technique is used to camouflage their own policy, which is against the interests of the peoples.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"144.	They will not succeed in casting aspersions on the socialist system and on our civic, social and moral values. No amount of malicious slander can possibly lessen the honest and peaceful policy of the USSR and of the entire socialist community. We and our allies firmly repudiate these calumnies and will give them the response they deserve.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"145.	The development of friendly relations among States, the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems, strict respect for the right of peoples to independence and social progress—these are the immutable principles upheld by the socialist countries in their foreign policy.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"146.	On the basis of a common world outlook and unity of purpose, these States fully co-operate and co-ordinate their policies in the interests of strengthening the foundations of international peace. They are asserting themselves as a powerful factor which has had a positive impact on world events.",UNGD
RUS,1983,147.	The countries of the socialist community have made the prevention of nuclear war the centrepiece of their foreign policy.,UNGD
RUS,1983,"148.	Who among responsible leaders and sober-minded, thinking people in general could fail to agree that this is the most urgent task of our time?",UNGD
RUS,1983,"149.	There have already been so many speeches made on this subject, here in the United Nations and elsewhere, since the advent of nuclear weapons, but a solution has yet to be found.",UNGD
RUS,1983,150.	The degree of progress in limiting and reducing nuclear arms will largely determine the nature of the international situation in the forthcoming period.,UNGD
RUS,1983,151.	The present moment is particularly crucial with regard to the situation developing in the matter of the limitation of nuclear arms in Europe.,UNGD
RUS,1983,"152.	The plans of the United States to deploy, under cover of a NATO decision, new nuclear missiles in some Western European countries have long been poisoning the political atmosphere on that continent and beyond. The implementation of these plans would have an adverse effect on the entire European and international situation and would significantly exacerbate nuclear confrontation.",UNGD
RUS,1983,153.	We believe that plans and ideas with regard to what is to be done with nuclear weapons—both in their totality and as regards nuclear systems in Europe—should be reversed.,UNGD
RUS,1983,"154.	The Soviet Union has supported the most radical solution, that is, that all such nuclear systems, both medium-range and tactical, should be removed from Europe. This would really be the zero option. However, NATO has pointedly made it clear that it is not ready to accept this.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"155.	We have proposed that the deployment of any new medium-range systems in Europe be cancelled and that all existing systems, both of the USSR and of NATO, be reduced by approximately two thirds; in other words, two thirds of the road towards totally ridding Europe of these weapons would have been covered.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"156.	Surely, it is quite clear what the Soviet Union is calling for in proposing this far-reaching step, which it is of course understood would not be the last word in the solution of this problem.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"157.	Why, then, has such a furor been created around the supposed desire of the USSR to gain the advantage in medium-range nuclear systems?",UNGD
RUS,1983,"158.	Why has it been concealed that the Soviet side is prepared, as has been repeatedly stated at the very highest level, not to have in Europe a single missile, a single aircraft or a single warhead in excess of what NATO countries would have? _",UNGD
RUS,1983,159.	Where is the objectivity in this approach? Any politician who claims to be objective is supposed to know at least the basic relevant facts and to make an honest assessment of them.,UNGD
RUS,1983,"160.	Recently the Soviet Union demonstrated once again its desire to reach agreement. Our initiative envisages that once a mutually acceptable agreement has been reached, including the renunciation by the United States of the deployment of new missiles in Europe, the USSR, while reducing its own medium-range missiles in the European part of our country to a level equal to the number of missiles possessed by Britain and France, would eliminate all the missiles affected by that reduction, including a considerable number of SS-20 missiles.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"161.	This renders totally groundless allegations that the USSR intends to retain the SS-20 missiles which are affected by the reduction, merely relocating them from Europe to the East.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"162.	Progress at the talks is being held up by the United States position, which in practice amounts to a demand for unilateral disarmament by the Soviet Union while the arsenals of medium-range nuclear weapons of the NATO countries would remain intact.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"163.	This position is merely disguised by talk about some flexibility on the part of the United States at the Geneva talks, Another instance of this so-called flexibility",UNGD
RUS,1983,"has just materialized, and the deception contained in it has become clear this time too. Mr. Andropov has stated: ""To leave aside details, the essence of the so-called new move in the United States position, which is billed as 'superb', boils down to a proposal to agree, as before, on how many Soviet medium-range missiles should be eliminated and how many new American missiles should be deployed in Europe in addition to the nuclear potential already possessed by NATO.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"""In brief, it is proposed that we talk about how to help the NATO bloc to upset to its own advantage the balance of medium-range nuclear systems in the European zone. And this move is presented brazenly as something new."" ",UNGD
RUS,1983,164.	The unacceptability of such an approach is so obvious as to indicate only one thing: a persistent reluctance on the part of our negotiating partners to search for a solution based on equality and equal security and their intention to station their missiles on European soil at any cost.,UNGD
RUS,1983,165.	Whether or not agreement is to be reached depends on the United States and on NATO as a whole. The current round of Soviet-American talks on the limitation of nuclear weapons in Europe is crucial in this sense.,UNGD
RUS,1983,"166.	If Washington's position remains so unconstructive, if Washington goes so far as actually to deploy new United States missiles in Europe, then we of course will have to take countermeasures to preserve the balance of forces on both a European and a global scale.",UNGD
RUS,1983,167.	It is to be hoped that Washington and other NATO capitals will ponder again and again the existing situation and the grave consequences which would result from another twist in the arms race.,UNGD
RUS,1983,"168.	The Soviet Union and the Warsaw Treaty States do not seek military superiority, but they will not allow anyone to acquire military superiority over them. They have invariably advocated equality, and equality at the lowest possible level.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"169.	The USSR proposals in the negotiations on the limitation and reduction of strategic arms are also based on the same approach. They call for, among other measures, a substantial reduction—a reduction by more than a quarter—of the total number of strategic delivery vehicles with a concurrent reduction to agreed equal limits of the aggregate number of nuclear weapons carried by these delivery vehicles. Our proposals arise from an interest in strengthening overall military strategic stability while strictly observing the principle of equality and equal security.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"170.	In the negotiations on the limitation of reduction of strategic weapons the United States has taken a one-sided approach. The position of the Washington Administration is actually aimed at promoting, rather than halting, the strategic arms race in areas where the United States sees advantages for itself.",UNGD
RUS,1983,171.	The fatal consequences of a nuclear war are not to be regarded as fictional conjectures. Its flames would not spare a single country or people.,UNGD
RUS,1983,172.	This is the unanimous view of the most eminent scholars and competent military and civilian experts.,UNGD
RUS,1983,"173.	There is and can be no justification for any actions that push the world towards the abyss, or for doctrines and designs based on the admissibility of a nuclear war and the possibility of winning it.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"174.	Guided by these considerations, the Soviet Union proposes the inclusion in the agenda of this session of the General Assembly of an important and urgent item entitled ""Condemnation of nuclear war"". ",UNGD
RUS,1983,"177. Such war must be condemned resolutely, unconditionally and for all time as the most hideous of crimes that can be committed against the peoples. We propose that States Members of the United Nations declare as criminal acts the formulation, promotion, dissemination and propagating of political and military doctrines and concepts designed to substantiate the ""legitimacy"" of the first use of nuclear weapons and in general the admissibility of unleashing nuclear war.",UNGD
RUS,1983,178. The USSR is submitting a draft declaration on this point to the Assembly for its consideration. Its adoption would contribute to generating a political climate which would make more difficult the actions of those who are devising plans calling for the first use of nuclear weapons.,UNGD
RUS,1983,"179. The approval of this declaration, following the Declaration on the Prevention of Nuclear Catastrophe adopted in 1981 on the initiative of the Soviet Union, would be a major move by the United Nations towards removing that threat.",UNGD
RUS,1983,180- The condemnation of nuclear war should be effectively backed up by practical steps to curb the nuclear arms race.,UNGD
RUS,1983,"181.	In this context a freeze on nuclear weapons by all States which possess them would be an extremely timely and truly tangible measure. The idea of such a freeze has been winning ever-increasing support in the world, in both nuclear and non-nuclear countries.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"182.	Our country proposed some time ago, in the course of negotiations on the limitation and reduction of strategic arms and on the limitation of nuclear weapons in Europe, that both strategic weapons and medium-range weapons in Europe be immediately frozen for the duration of the negotiations.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"183.	Now the Soviet Union is submitting an urgent and important question entitled ""Nuclear arms freeze"" to this session of the General Assembly for its consideration.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"184.	Our proposal is for a cessation, under effective verification, of the build-up of all components of nuclear arsenals, including all kinds of delivery vehicles and weapons, a renunciation of the deployment of new kinds and types of such weapons, the establishment of a moratorium on all tests of nuclear weapons and of new kinds and types of delivery vehicles, and a halt in the production of fissionable materials for the purpose of creating arms.",UNGD
RUS,1983,185.	A simultaneous quantitative and qualitative freeze on nuclear weapons by all nuclear Powers is the best way to achieve this goal. Our country is prepared to agree that initially this be done by the USSR and the United States on a bilateral basis as an example to other nuclear States.,UNGD
RUS,1983,"186.	Giving practical effect to this initiative would markedly raise the degree of trust among the nuclear- weapon countries and would make it possible to move decisively towards breaking the vicious circle of the arms race. This would also promote the reduction and, eventually, the complete elimination of nuclear weapons.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"187.	We express the hope that States Members of the United Nations, above all the other nuclear Powers, will take a responsible and constructive stand on our proposal and will support it.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"188.	The Soviet proposal entitled ""Conclusion of a treaty on the prohibition of the use of force in outer space and from outer space against Earth"" submitted to the current session for consideration, has been prompted by concern for preventing the militarization of outer space, an issue which is becoming extremely important.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"189.	Positive action on this initiative, which is a follow- up to our 1981 proposal made here at the United Nations for a treaty on the prohibition of the stationing of weapons of any kind in outer space, would be in keeping with the urgent task of ensuring peaceful, and exclusively peaceful, use of outer space in the interest of and for the benefit of all people.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"190.	Specifically, the idea is to have a comprehensive ban on the testing and deployment of any space-based weapons designed to destroy targets on Earth, in the air or in outer space.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"191.	At the same time, provision is made for the complete renunciation of the development of new anti-satellite systems and the elimination of existing systems. If it would be of any help, we are also prepared to conduct separate talks on anti-satellite systems, including talks with the United States on a bilateral basis.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"192.	The obligation assumed by the USSR not to be the first to place any kind of anti-satellite weapons in outer space is yet a further manifestation of its desire to see the problem of such weapons solved in a radical way. This unilateral moratorium declared by our country is to last for as long as other States, in particular the United States, refrain from placing anti-satellite weapons of any kind in outer space.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"193.	The initiatives we are taking at this session are a logical extension of our foreign policy, based as it is on principle, and of the convincing peace-oriented proposals that the Soviet Union has been putting forward in recent years.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"194.	Among the many other steps taken by the Soviet Union in the key areas of international life, I would like to single out the following.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"195.	There is the obligation by the USSR not to be the first to use nuclear weapons. If such an obligation were assumed by all the nuclear Powers, this in practice would be tantamount to a prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons. Our appeal for this remains in force.",UNGD
RUS,1983,196.	There is also the proposal for a treaty on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests. This is consistent with the task of preventing the possibility of developing new kinds of nuclear weapons and of strengthening the non-proliferation regime. The Committee on Disarmament should as a matter of priority take measures with a view to producing the draft of such a treaty.,UNGD
RUS,1983,"197.	Furthermore, there are proposals for banning neutron weapons as well as for preparing an international convention on the prohibition and elimination of chemical weapons.",UNGD
RUS,1983,198.	These and other Soviet initiatives aimed at limiting the arms race and bringing about disarmament deserve the most serious attention.,UNGD
RUS,1983,"199.	I would like to make special mention of the joint proposal of the socialist countries for a treaty on the mutual non-use of military force and the maintenance of peaceful relations between the States of the Warsaw Treaty and the North Atlantic alliance. The obligation not to use weapons of any kind—nuclear or conventional—that is to say, not to use force at all, would help to dispel mutual fear and distrust. The initiative is gaining increasing prominence in European and world politics.",UNGD
RUS,1983,200.	It has always been our view that the problem of security on the European continent should be treated with particular circumspection. It is precisely here in Europe that the two militarily most powerful groupings of States —the Warsaw Treaty and NATO—are facing each other. ,UNGD
RUS,1983,"201.	In view of all this, not a single move in Europe leading to the easing of tensions and the positive development of relations among States could be redundant or superfluous.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"202.	It is time to break the deadlock in the talks on the mutual reduction of armed forces and armaments in central Europe, where the level of military confrontation is particularly high. The draft agreement submitted at Vienna by the socialist countries creates real conditions for narrowing the gap between the positions and for reaching agreement.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"203.	The Conference on Confidence- and Security- building Measures and Disarmament in Europe scheduled for next January at Stockholm will play an important role in enhancing European and international security. The USSR, to the extent it can, will seek to ensure that the work of the Conference is fruitful and lives up to the expectations placed in it by political circles and broad sectors of public opinion in European and other countries.",UNGD
RUS,1983,204.	The Soviet Union attaches great importance to preserving and expanding its diverse ties with the countries of Western Europe. We intend to continue to maintain relations with them along the lines traced by the. Helsinki Final Act in a spirit of trust and co-operation.,UNGD
RUS,1983,"205.	The successful conclusion of the Madrid meeting of representatives of States participating in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe is quite rightly viewed as an indication that the policy of detente, which has been so beneficial for all the peoples of Europe, has a great deal of vitality.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"206.	Even though there has been a coolness in relations in the current international situation, this proves that despite considerable divergences in their policies, States with different social systems are capable of solving together problems that are not at all easy to solve, and of searching for and finding areas of agreement.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"207.	We would like to believe that appropriate conclusions will be drawn from this, and not only as regards Europe and relations among European States.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"208.	This November marks the fiftieth anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and the United States. The whole history of Soviet-American relations makes it abundantly clear that whenever these two States have followed a course of mutual understanding and co-operation, their peoples as well as universal peace and security have gained thereby.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"209.	It has been our invariable view that the maintenance of normal stable relations between the Soviet Union and the United States is in their mutual interest, and we are in favour of their overall improvement and peaceful co-operation.",UNGD
RUS,1983,210.	It is not through any choice of ours that Soviet- American relations are currently marked by tensions which also affect the international situation.,UNGD
RUS,1983,"211.	Today, the urgency of the problem of preventing the threat of war requires that each State be fully aware of the degree of its responsibility and to reaffirm, both in word and in deed, its commitment to the policy of peace. The Soviet Union is in favour of combining our efforts on the broadest possible basis in order to achieve this noble goal.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"212.	In the service of peace there is room for action by every country, regardless of its social system, its level of economic development, its size or its geographic location.",UNGD
RUS,1983,213.	Such an important State as the People's Republic of China can do a great deal to ease international tension and eliminate the danger of nuclear war.,UNGD
RUS,1983,"214.	The Soviet Union is ready for a political dialogue with China on questions of bilateral relations, as well as on central problems connected with strengthening peace and international security. The positive development of Soviet-Chinese relations, which should be constructed with due account being taken of and mutual respect for the interests of each side and, naturally, without detriment to third countries, would benefit our two peoples and promote a better political climate in the world arena.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"215.	We welcome the growing activity of the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America in defending international peace. They need lasting peace to solve the difficult problems of their national and social development.",UNGD
RUS,1983,216.	The results of the non-aligned forum held this year at New Delhi have once again demonstrated the anti-war and anti-imperialist orientation of the Movement of Non- Aligned Countries.,UNGD
RUS,1983,"217.	The policy of peace of India, the current Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement, enjoys well-deserved prestige. The Soviet Union and India are linked by bonds of friendship and close co-operation which are highly valued by both sides.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"218.	The Soviet Union pursues a course of principle with regard to the elimination of all manifestations of inequality and exploitation, the building of confidence in economic ties between States and the establishment of just international economic relations.",UNGD
RUS,1983,219.	The peoples of developing States have a real awareness of the magnitude and nature of our assistance in helping them to overcome their economic backwardness. In this area the Soviet Union is doing more than any developed capitalist country.,UNGD
RUS,1983,"220.	The Soviet Union supports the demand for the early launching, within the United Nations, of ""global negotiations"" on major economic problems, as envisaged in decisions of the General Assembly, and also the idea of the convening, within the framework of the United Nations, of an international conference on these subjects.",UNGD
RUS,1983,221.	We have been and we remain sympathetic to the developing countries which are striving to do away with the tyranny of monopoly capital and free themselves from neo-colonialist exploitation.,UNGD
RUS,1983,"222.	Our country is firmly on the side of those who, to this very day, are fighting for their freedom and independence, those who are being forced to repel the aggressor or being threatened with aggression. This stand is inseparable from our struggle for lasting peace on Earth.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"223.	In the present alarming international situation there is also need for the mobilization of the entire impressive potential of the United Nations as an instrument for maintaining international security. The Soviet Union has supported and will continue to support consistently and resolutely United Nations efforts to remove the threat of nuclear war, curb the arms race, eliminate the existing hotbeds of international tension and prevent the emergence of new ones and to develop relations of peace and co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.",UNGD
RUS,1983,"224.	No matter how complicated the situation, real possibilities exist for overcoming the difficulties of this period in international relations. Mr. Andropov stressed in his statement of 28 September:",UNGD
RUS,1983,"""The Soviet leadership does not hesitate about which line to follow in international affairs in the present critical situation . . . Our course remains aimed at preserving and strengthening peace, lessening tension, curbing the arms race and expanding and deepening co-operation between States. This is the unfailing will of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, of all Soviet people. These are, we are convinced also the aspirations of all peoples.""",UNGD
RUS,1983,"225.	We appeal to all States to draw sensible conclusions in the existing situation, conclusions that are in keeping with the most profound aspirations of the peoples, and above all to exert efforts urgently to solve the problem common to all mankind, that of eliminating the risk of nuclear war.",UNGD
RUS,1983,226.	People must feel secure about their future.,UNGD
RUS,1983, ,UNGD
RUS,1983,,UNGD
RUS,1984,"Mr. Lusaka, I congratulate you on your election to the office of President of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Our congratulations also go to the representatives of Brunei Darussalam, a State which has become the 159th Member of the United Nations.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"58.	For almost 40 years now, the words ""the United Nations"" have been firmly established in the world's political vocabulary. There is virtually no major international problem in connection with which those words would not be spoken in different languages, both in this Hall and outside it.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"59.	The extensive involvement of the United Nations in world affairs and developments is determined by the very mission of this forum, which was brought into being in order to unite the political will and potential of States for the purpose of maintaining international peace and security.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"60.	The conclusion reached by the founding Members of the United Nations was very simple indeed. It was born of the experience of the most bloody and destructive war that has ever befallen mankind. Indeed, it was precisely through united efforts that the aggressor was crushed. High was the cost of the great victory whose fortieth anniversary will be observed next year. All the peoples who fought against fascism contributed to that victory, but the Soviet Union's decisive role in it is indisputable.",UNGD
RUS,1984,61.	United efforts were and are still needed today in order to build the post-war world. For it is the main lesson of the Second World War that States must stand together in the fight against war.,UNGD
RUS,1984,"62.	It is common knowledge, however, that as the war-ravaged earth was still smouldering and thousands of towns and villages were in ruins, the international atmosphere once again began to deteriorate and ultimately to become critical. This happened through the fault of those who, in their quest for world hegemony, began to behave contrary to their obligations as allies in the anti-Hitlerite coalition, oblivious to the lessons of the past.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"63.	In disregard of the lofty purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, which they too had just signed, a group of States set out to escalate their military preparations by putting together a system of aggressive military blocs with the North Atlantic Alliance as its pivot. Those States pledged themselves to a policy based on a position of strength, a policy of brinkmanship. They are responsible for the advent of the cold war, which for a long time froze the normal flow of international life for which the peoples of the world yearned.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"64.	As a result, in the post-war years the world has been in a state of fever. And whenever international relations were marked—as was the case during the period of detente—by budding cooperation between States with different social systems, no effort was spared to undermine those positive processes, which is exactly what happened at the whim of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] military bloc. It is precisely this trend in world politics that is the source of the situation that characterizes the international climate today. The threat of war has grown and the foundations of world peace have become more shaky.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"65.	This course, which is manifest as never before in the current policies of the United States and of those who choose to be its accomplices, is opposed by a broad front of peace-loving States and forces.",UNGD
RUS,1984,66.	The Soviet Union is in the vanguard of active champions of peace. It has been and remains faithful to its solemn pledge taken right after the criminal Fascist swastika was crushed and the Hitlerite war machine smashed. The essence of that pledge has not faded with the years; it is to fight resolutely to ensure that the flames of world war never flare up again. The fact that it has been possible for almost 40 years to ward it off is largely to the credit of the countries which pursue a policy of peace among nations and frustrate—by their international prestige and influence—aggressive and adventuristic designs wherever they originate. The Soviet Union is one of them.,UNGD
RUS,1984,"67.	Together with other socialist countries, we shall continue to work in the interest of improving international relations. This is precisely the thrust of the documents of the meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the States Parties to the Warsaw Treaty, held at Prague on 4 and 5 January 1983, and of the high-level Economic Conference of the member countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, held in Moscow from 12 to 14 June 1984.",UNGD
RUS,1984,68.	The Soviet Union and the States of the socialist community are concentrating their efforts on attaining the key objective of preventing a nuclear disaster. For if the destructive potential currently amassed in the world were unleashed the human race would probably cease to exist. To prevent that from happening is a goal of overriding importance. AH States represented in the United Nations should contribute to its achievement. No one and nothing can relieve them of the responsibility they have assumed under the Charter of the United Nations for the destiny of present and succeeding generations.,UNGD
RUS,1984,"69.	As was stressed recently by Mr. Chernenko, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics: ""The world has radically changed. Its problems cannot be solved by force ... it is imperative to adopt a policy of realism, reason and business-like cooperation in solving the problems that face mankind.""",UNGD
RUS,1984,"70.	Those who truly hold dear the interests of peace cannot confine themselves merely to stating that there exists a threat of nuclear war. It is necessary to pinpoint the source of that threat. Clarity in this regard is not merely a matter of historical fairness. An understanding of the factors that are pushing mankind towards a nuclear abyss also determines the answer to the question whether or not this calamitous process can be stopped, and how.",UNGD
RUS,1984,71.	It is of fundamental importance to compare the two political trends and the two approaches to the problem of nuclear weapons.,UNGD
RUS,1984,"72.	Right after Hiroshima and Nagasaki the world witnessed the inception of a policy of ever greater stockpiles of nuclear weapons and nuclear blackmail. The Soviet Union forcefully called for the outlawing of these most deadly and destructive weapons. Indeed, as early as 1946 the Soviet Union submitted at the United Nations a draft international convention on the prohibition for all time of the production and use of nuclear weapons and on the destruction of their stockpiles. I am sure there are some present here in this Hall who witnessed the discussion of this item at that time.",UNGD
RUS,1984,73.	Yet our former allies in the struggle against fascism did not have the heart to vote for that proposal. Their reaction then was bound to make the peoples apprehensive and it did cause serious apprehension.,UNGD
RUS,1984,"74.	And what is the situation today? Statements are being openly made at the highest official levels that the United States has the right to deliver a first nuclear strike, that is to say, to unleash a nuclear war.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"75.	Our country sought a ban on nuclear weapons both when it did not possess them and after it developed them. Today, as before, the Soviet Union favours prompt measures to reduce and eventually eliminate nuclear weapons altogether. This is the aim of a comprehensive set of initiatives advanced by the Soviet Union.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"76.	Whenever the United States side showed realism and the will to come to agreement on the basis of the principle of equality and equal security—something that did happen before—it proved possible to reach important accords. Thus, a major step forward was taken with the conclusion in 1972 by the Soviet Union and the United States of the Interim Agreement on Certain Measures with respect to the Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms and the Treaty on the Limitation of Antiballistic Missile Systems.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"77.	However, in the years that followed, our attempts to reduce or at least to limit nuclear arms failed to produce concrete results. The tug of war between the groups that determine United States foreign policy has been won by the militaristically minded. They attempt to devalue the existing Soviet American accords by wrecking what was achieved earlier through long and painstaking work on both sides, as was done with the SALT II Treaty.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"78.	They broke off and refuse to resume the trilateral talks between the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear weapons tests. They stalled the ratification of the Soviet United States treaties on the limitation of underground nuclear weapons tests and on peaceful nuclear explosions that had been signed a long time ago. And what tremendous efforts were required to arrive at those treaties and agreements.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"79.	Those and other similar actions are but a few examples of the policy of the United States, whose central objective is to try to secure military superiority for itself.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"80.	Stories intended to mislead people are being churned out in profusion. Not that they are particularly reticent about saying that, should they eventually feel like negotiating, they would do so only from strength. To that end—they claim—the United States must first build up its military muscle.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"81.	It took Washington a long time to send its team to the negotiating table at Geneva. However, at the talks the United States side followed a scenario that was not designed to lead to agreement. How else can one describe the fact that while negotiating the limitation of nuclear arms in Europe our partners did exactly the opposite? Beforehand—I repeat, beforehand—they set the date for deploying new United States medium range missiles on the territories of several Western European States. We were told to accept the United States position or else there would be no agreement. So there is no agreement.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"82.	As to the Soviet proposals paving the way to agreements, they were rejected out of hand. Anything aimed at reaching agreement on the basis of equality was opposed with hostility.",UNGD
RUS,1984,83.	It was Washington's deliberate intention to wreck the negotiations on nuclear arms—both medium range and strategic. And it succeeded in this. Juggling with words ostensibly in favour of negotiations is a false propaganda ploy. Its purpose is obvious.,UNGD
RUS,1984,"84.	Now they rejoice that they were able to keep the timetable and begin the deployment of their missiles in Europe, as planned. Even here in the course of the General Assembly one can meet representatives of Western European States who are rubbing their hands with pleasure over the fact that the plan for deployment is being implemented.",UNGD
RUS,1984,85.	It makes no difference whether deception is crude or cleverly packaged. A good idea is being exploited for unsavoury purposes.,UNGD
RUS,1984,"86.	We have noticed that there are realistically minded politicians and statesmen in the West, including the United States, who realize that it is precisely in this way that the issue of negotiations is being used.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"87.	No, the path of stockpiling of nuclear weapons is not the right path to follow. The movement must be in the opposite direction, leading to the removal of these weapons and to their subsequent elimination both in Europe and throughout the world. This is the course of our policy.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"88.	The Soviet Union is in favour of serious talks. Not only are we prepared for such talks, but we are insisting on them. Our proposals on the limitation and reduction of strategic arms and on the limitation of nuclear arms in Europe remain valid. They neither offer advantages nor do any harm to either side. The United States must remove the obstacles it has put in the way of the talks. Unless these obstacles are removed, of course, these talks will not take place, and this is what the United States has in mind.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"89.	It is often asked: since it is difficult for the time being to arrive at a radical solution to the problem of nuclear arms, would it not be possible to take steps that would create a favourable atmosphere for that, raise the level of trust among States and ease international tension?",UNGD
RUS,1984,"90.	We are convinced that such steps are both possible and necessary. An effective measure of this kind would be the implementation of our proposal, endorsed by the United Nations, for a quantitative and qualitative freeze of nuclear weapon arsenals by all States which possess them. Thin could be done in the first place by the Soviet Union and the United States on a bilateral basis to set an example for other nuclear Powers to follow. Could we not do this? We propose to Washington: let us set such an example.",UNGD
RUS,1984,91.	For the time being it is necessary at least to suspend the nuclear arms race. The world has crossed the line beyond which any further build-up and improvement of these arms is not only dangerous but senseless.,UNGD
RUS,1984,"92.	In the present circumstances it is futile and hopeless for anyone to expect to get ahead and gain military superiority. It is absolutely illusory to hope to win a nuclear war: whether global or limited, blitzkrieg or protracted—whatever the nuclear war doctrines.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"93.	Such is the authoritative and unanimous conclusion of scientists and competent military and civilian experts of world renown, with the exception of those, of course, who have lost their honour and conscience or those who were not at all endowed by nature with either.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"94.	What kind of people can fail to see that peace today is fragile? In spite of the obvious, they once again proclaim a policy of ""peace through strength"". Moreover, they are trying to elevate this policy to the level of statesmanship. All we hear is that strength, strength and, above all, strength is the guarantee of international peace. In other words—weapons, weapons and still more weapons. But does not the experience of the past—both recent and remote— show otherwise?",UNGD
RUS,1984,95.	In the face of the currently aggravated dangerous military and political confrontation it is extremely important not to miss the chance. Agreement should be reached on freezing nuclear weapons and prospects opened up for a subsequent reduction of arsenals of these weapons. ,UNGD
RUS,1984,"96.	Sentiments in favour of such a solution have become widespread in the world. As is well known, the broadest sections of the population in the United States and other Western countries spontaneously come out in favour of this solution, and we fully understand their aspirations.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"97.	Only ill will can guide those who spawn all kinds of insinuations that the Soviet Union all but manipulates or is behind this movement. Let them ask what it is that the people who take to the streets in mass marches of protest are fighting for. Let them ask those people themselves. Let them ask those people, not us. They will give only one answer: they are fighting for life. What kind of people can assume that the Americans or the British, the French or the Italians, the Germans or the Dutch wish to perish in the flames of nuclear war? We think that those who hope to crush the antinuclear movement by punitive measures realize it full well.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"98.	In this light, what is the value of the human rights rhetoric in which they just love to indulge in their speeches, statements before various commissions and committees, in articles and voluminous reports to parliaments. In fact, the proponents of the arms race do not care a bit about these rights, including the paramount human right—the right to life.",UNGD
RUS,1984,99.	There can be no justification for any action that pushes the world to nuclear war. It is only natural that last year the General Assembly adopted—at the Soviet initiative—by an overwhelming majority of its Members resolution 38/75 condemning nuclear war as the most hideous crime that could be committed against peoples.,UNGD
RUS,1984,"100.	A nuclear age requires that political thinking be consonant with its realities. Where categories such as ""strength"", ""deterrence"" and ""superiority"" still prevail in this thinking, they must be replaced by concepts of the non-use of force and of trust, equality and mutual regard for security interests.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"101.	It would be of fundamental importance if nuclear Powers observed, in relations between themselves, certain norms that were formulated by Mr. Chernenko in his statement last March. It is proposed that these Powers: regard the prevention of nuclear war as the primary objective of their foreign policy, preclude situations fraught with the risk of nuclear conflict and, should such a risk arise, hold urgent consultations in order to prevent a nuclear conflagration; renounce the propaganda of any nuclear war scenario, whether global or limited; assume an obligation to forgo the first use of nuclear weapons; under no circumstances use nuclear weapons against nonnuclear countries which have no such weapons on their territory, respect the status of the existing nuclear free zone and encourage the establishment of new such zones in various parts of the world; prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons in any form; not transfer to any recipient whatsoever such weapons or control over them, not deploy them on the territory of countries where there are no such weapons and not extend the nuclear arms race to new environments, including outer space; seek, step by step, on the basis of the principle of equal security, the reduction of nuclear armaments up to and including the complete elimination of all types of such weapons.",UNGD
RUS,1984,102.	The Soviet Union is in favour of reaching agreement at any time with other nuclear Powers on the mutual recognition of such norms and making them binding. This would serve to reduce the risk of the outbreak of a nuclear conflict.,UNGD

RUS,1984,"104.	The extension of the arms race to outer space, unless checked in time, could become an irreversible process. Effective measures are needed to keep outer space peaceful.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"105.	No one country should believe that this is for others, not for it, to decide. Such an attitude would be a big mistake.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"106.	A major step has been our initiative in calling for Soviet United States talks on preventing the militarization of outer space. We believe that the Soviet Union and the United States, as the leading Powers in the field of outer space exploration, should do all they can to keep outer space peaceful and in particular, with a view to accomplishing this task, to lay the foundations for multilateral agreement. This idea seems to be alive among many States. Full responsibility for the failure to hold the talks rests with the United States side. Washington is unwilling to engage in the talks.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"107.	Ask any man in the street in any town in the United States, in the Soviet Union or in any other country whether he believes that nuclear weapons should be stationed in space, beyond the Earth's atmosphere, at an altitude of hundreds of kilometres, and that outer space should become a springboard for war preparations, or whether he feels that this should not be allowed to happen. There is no doubt that the answer will be unequivocal: this cannot be allowed.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"108.	We urge the United States Government to recognize that the militarization of outer space threatens the whole of mankind, including the American people themselves. We express the hope that the United States will refrain from actions which would make irreversible the process of turn outer space into an arena of military rivalry and it will be willing to engage in talks with a view reaching an agreement. For its part, the Soviet Union continues to be in favour of starting such talks as soon as possible.",UNGD
RUS,1984,109.	The General Assembly would be doing a good thing if it forcefully voiced its concerted opinion that the militarization of outer space should not be allowed to take place and that outer space must be used solely for the good of peoples and not for sowing death and destruction on Earth. We hope that every member of every delegation in this Hall will give serious thought to this.,UNGD
RUS,1984,"110.	In seeking to promote this goal in every possible way, the Soviet Union proposes the inclusion in the agenda of the current session of the Assembly of an important and urgent item entitled ""Use of outer space exclusively for peaceful purposes for the benefit of mankind"". What we are talking about is, in the first place, the banning, without delay and for all time, of the use of force in and from outer space against the Earth, as well as from the Earth against objects in outer space. In other words, agreement must be reached on the prohibition and elimination of space attack weapons of all systems, whatever their mode of basing, designed to destroy objects in space. This applies above all to States with major space capabilities. ",UNGD
RUS,1984,111. The United Nations should speak out emphatically and with all its authority in favour of achieving reliably verifiable agreements on a bilateral and a multilateral basis. The way must be opened for concerted and constructive efforts by States which could eventually lead to the creation of a world organization for the use of outer space exclusively for peaceful purposes.,UNGD
RUS,1984,112.	Among those present here there are bound to be people who in 1982 witnessed the Soviet Union solemnly assume in this Hall a unilateral obligation not to be the first to use nuclear weapons. That decision—which was not an easy one to take—is of exceptional importance.,UNGD
RUS,1984,"113.	Our country continues to urge the other nuclear Powers, which have not yet done so, to assume a similar obligation. This would also be a tangible historic contribution to international confidence building. Much is said about trust and confidence, but by no means is everything done to bring it about.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"114.	Surely the implementation of the proposal of the socialist countries to conclude a treaty on the mutual non-use of military force in relations between the States of the Warsaw Treaty and the North Atlantic Alliance would help to dissipate mutual apprehensions. It would be a welcome decision if an obligation not to be the first to use either nuclear or conventional weapons against one another—in other words, not to use force—were undertaken by States whether or not they belong to military alliances or have a neutral or nonaligned status.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"115.	We have also submitted these and some other major proposals at the Conference on Confidence and Security building Measures and Disarmament in Europe, meeting at Stockholm. They have been submitted in combination with certain confidence building measures in the military field.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"116.	Representatives of NATO countries, on the other hand, take what is actually an obstructionist position with regard to these proposals. What is proposed under the guise of military and technical measures is a programme, which they have drawn up, of poorly disguised espionage. The measures they are trying to sell do not, of course, affect a single inch of the territory of the United States—that is, the country in which the foundations of the military machine of the NATO bloc are to be found. It is on Soviet territory that they are proposing to carry out these measures.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"117.	The same can be said about the prospects of the Vienna Talks on Mutual Reduction of Forces and Armaments and Associated Measures in Central Europe. The fruitless ""data"" discussion started by the Western participants has long been stalling those talks.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"118.	The NATO countries are evading the business-like discussion of cardinal questions, above all those dealing with arms reduction, although without such discussions there can be no real strengthening of security and stability on the European continent. At the Vienna talks too, there should be no place for any of the kind of political manoeuvring in which our negotiating partners like so much to indulge.",UNGD
RUS,1984,119.	Some two years ago at Geneva the Soviet Union introduced at the Conference on Disarmament draft basic provisions for a convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons. That draft constitutes a well-balanced basis for agreement. Some of its provisions were subsequently revised and amended to accommodate the positions of the other participants in the talks.,UNGD
RUS,1984,"120.	Not everyone wants to see a successful completion of those talks. Some would rather see them fail. It would seem that the ostensible interest of certain States serves to conceal their plans for a build-up of chemical weapons. Such tactics should be strongly condemned. We may presume that certain War Departments are doing this. But where are the statesmen? Where are true sobriety and farsightedness, a wide-angle look at peace and the fate of the world?",UNGD
RUS,1984,"121.	The drafting of an international convention on the prohibition and elimination of chemical weapons should be speeded up, and the United Nations could contribute to this in no small measure. With time this problem will become eve:, more intractable.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"122.	Our country expresses its readiness to take part in multilateral negotiations on the limitation of naval activities and naval armaments and on the extension of confidence-building measures to seas and oceans, especially to regions with the busiest sea lanes or with the highest likelihood of conflict situations. We have already put forward a proposal— and this is worth recalling—for an agreement on appropriate measures, including those applicable to particular regions, such as the Indian, Atlantic or Pacific Oceans, the Mediterranean Sea or the Persian Gulf.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"123.	The convening of an international conference on the Indian Ocean is being inadmissibly delayed. The United States and some of its allies disregard the will of the littoral States that wish to see a peaceful Indian Ocean and clear skies above it. As before, the Soviet Union continues actively to advocate the turning of this ocean into a zone of peace, something that would be a major step towards preventing the militarization of the world's oceans.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"124.	The arms race is seriously damaging to people even when the guns are silent, for it is increasingly consuming intellectual and material wealth and impedes the solution of global problems such as the elimination of hunger and disease, the search for new sources of energy, and the preservation of the environment.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"125.	These tasks will not be accomplished either by declaratory statements or by attempts to make assistance to other countries contingent on their acceptance of a particular model of socioeconomic development. Something else is required, namely, the renunciation of all forms of exploitation and of the use of trade and economic ties as tools of political pressure, and a restructuring of international economic relations on a just and democratic basis.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"126.	By pressing for the implementation of tangible measures for curbing the arms race and achieving disarmament in close connection with the solution of world economic and social development problems, we consider that reduction of military budgets in either percentage or absolute terms is a promising way to achieve such a goal. And yes, I am talking about military budgets.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"127.	Together with the other States signatories of the Warsaw Treaty, the Soviet Union has submitted a proposal to the countries of the North Atlantic bloc to begin talks on the question of the mutual non increase of military expenditures and their subsequent reduction. In our view, there should be no obstacles to the participation of States that do not belong to these military and political groupings in implementing the proposed measures.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"128.	However, so far there has been no response from the NATO countries, and that is no accident. If a picture were taken today using the most sophisticated modem technology to show on a planetary scale the magnitude of the worldwide military preparations by the United States and its allies, it would reveal a view that would stun any thinking person: a palisade of missiles; strategic bombers; naval armadas plying the waters of the seas and oceans; hundreds of military bases scattered all over the globe; and colossal stockpiles of weapons of every type.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"129.	Some may say that the Soviet Union too has weapons on land, in the air and on and under water. Our answer is: Yes, we do have them, but not by our choice. The objective facts of post-war history irrefutably show that it was not the Soviet Union, not socialism, but rather the other side that initiated the arms race and each of its new spirals. That is where the truth lies.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"130.	Forced to take countermeasures, our country did so only in response to, and to the extent commensurate with, the protection of its own security and that of its friends and allies. We have never sought, nor are we seeking, superiority. We stand for maintaining military equilibrium, and at the lowest possible level at that.",UNGD
RUS,1984,131.	We have put forward no less than 100 constructive initiatives from the rostrum of the United Nations alone. The whole world knows that it was the Soviet Union that came forward with the most radical proposal—general and complete disarmament combined with general and complete control. No one else has proposed this.,UNGD
RUS,1984,132.	Numerous proposals have been made by the Soviet Union to curb the arms race in some of its areas. We have proposed—and our proposal still stands—that agreement be reached on the complete prohibition of nuclear weapon tests and on the prohibition of the development and manufacture of new types of weapons of mass destruction and of new systems of such weapons.,UNGD
RUS,1984,133.	The Soviet Union has also been making sustained efforts to reduce conventional armaments and armed forces by proposing that this problem be solved on both a global and a regional basis.,UNGD
RUS,1984,"134.	The world community welcomed the Soviet initiatives that brought forth major international treaties and agreements—the Treaty on the Non Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under Water, the Treaty on the Prohibition of the Emplacement of Nuclear Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction on the Seabed and the Ocean Floor and in the Subsoil Thereof, the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction, and so on. They continue to serve their purpose to this day and serve it well.",UNGD
RUS,1984,135.	We have voluntarily and unilaterally assumed a number of obligations ranging from no-first-use of nuclear weapons to practical steps limiting our armed forces and armaments in Central Europe.,UNGD
RUS,1984,"136.	While making its own constructive contributions, the Soviet Union reacts favourably to proposals made by other countries. We support the idea of establishing nuclear free zones and zones of peace in various parts of the globe. We have responded positively to the recent initiative by Argentina, Greece, India, Mexico, Sweden and the United Republic of Tanzania, contained in their Joint Declaration, which urged all nuclear Powers to stop the build-up of nuclear weapons and begin to reduce their stockpiles.",UNGD
RUS,1984,137.	The proposals that we have made constitute an impressive list of initiatives aimed at easing international tensions and developing peaceful cooperation among States.,UNGD
RUS,1984,"138.	Yet no matter what proposals or arguments we advance, our counterparts say ""no""—they are not acceptable.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"139.	They swear that they favour a halt in the arms race, but only through modernization of arms and through improvement and stockpiling of weapons. Is it not absurd? It is absurd, indeed, and it underlies the entire policy. They would have people believe that they favour a reduction in world tensions, but only by establishing more and more military bases, by intensifying military preparations, by militarizing outer space and by deploying new kinds of United States nuclear weapons in Europe.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"140.	What is needed to prevent hunger and disease from claiming the lives of countless millions of people? According to the logic of NATO countries, this can be achieved by throwing as much money and resources as possible down the insatiable maw of the war industry.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"141.	It would appear that there is no other path towards ensuring peace than war preparations. This is twisted logic, a logic of frenzied militarism.",UNGD
RUS,1984,142.	All States must have a clear understanding of why none of the important and acute international problems is being solved at present. This applies first and foremost to nuclear weapons and the arms race.,UNGD
RUS,1984,"143.	They are not being solved because the NATO States do not want it. The instigator of this policy is, of course, Washington. It has firmly linked its foreign policy plans with the further stockpiling of nuclear weapons as well as other types of weapons of mass destruction. It has put up an insurmountable wall on the path to agreement.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"144.	Even elementary decency is lacking in cases where representatives of the two Powers—the Soviet Union and the United States—meet to discuss one thing or another. Everything the United States side says is intended to secure unilateral advantages for the United States. Therefore, from the very outset things are doomed to failure. If there are political genes, then failure is genetically inevitable.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"145.	If you read closely the documents setting out the policy of the United States Administration for the future—and there are quite a lot of them—you will see that these documents, which are imbued with the spirit of imperial ambitions and enmity towards the Soviet Union and other peace-loving States, glorify the course aimed at United States domination m the world and extol arms and strength. Thus, they set the stage for deadlocks i.e. solution of all the acute problems of today.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"146.	We are convinced that each State, irrespective of its social system, whether big or small, will realize that this is a course that leads to a further aggravation of tensions in the world, to an increased risk of a nuclear catastrophe. ",UNGD
RUS,1984,"147.	The Soviet delegation is authorized to state before this high forum that the Soviet Union will follow the same policy course it has pursued up to now, namely, the course aimed at peace, disarmament, limitation and subsequent elimination of nuclear armaments, and the solution of other acute problems of today.",UNGD
RUS,1984,148.	One should face the truth squarely. It is precisely the current United States policy that has made the gap between these two courses in world politics wider and deeper than ever before and has virtually blocked the paths leading to agreement.,UNGD
RUS,1984,"149.	Today, many people are wondering anxiously if everything has been lost and the only thing left is to acknowledge that international relations have plunged into total darkness.",UNGD
RUS,1984,150.	We do not accept such a view of the situation in the world. A feeling of doom is alien to our world outlook. An insurmountable barrier must be erected against war. An end must be put to the stockpiling of weapons in the world.,UNGD
RUS,1984,"151.	It is understandable that prevention of war is a difficult task. The flywheel of military production is revolving continuously, and influential forces— which place the interests of dominating the world above everything else—will not stop it.",UNGD

In defiance of the elementary norms of international law and morality, an act of banditry was committed against tiny Grenada, which dared to assert its sovereignty.

A real siege—military, political and economic—has been mounted against Nicaragua, whose people, defending their national freedom, independence and democratic achievements, are heroically resisting in the (ace of the undeclared war organized against it by Washington. But the Nicaraguan people want just one thing: they want their independence and they want to resolve their internal affairs as they themselves see fit.",UNGD
RUS,1984,155.	The United States still cannot reconcile itself to the existence of socialist Cuba. Threats are being made against Cuba to force that country off the course to which it has been committed in both words and deeds.,UNGD
RUS,1984,156.	The situation in Central America—where a dangerous pocket of tension has been created— should be settled by peaceful means on the basis of an unconditional cessation of United States interference in the internal affairs of the countries of the region. Possibilities for such a settlement have been opened up thanks to the constructive approach of Nicaragua and Cuba and to the initiative of the States of the Contadora Group. The Soviet Union supports the efforts to reach a political settlement of the problem.,UNGD

Still fresh in our memories are the barbaric acts in Lebanon undertaken in an attempt to force upon it a capitulation agreement with Israel, and these acts are still going on today.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"158.	Yet the facts show that the United States, which relies upon ""strategic cooperation"" with Israel, has no intention of establishing lasting peace in that region.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"159.	The Soviet Union has recently put forward a proposal on the principles of a Middle East settlement. That proposal is well known and has evoked a broad response.

The foes of the Afghan people will stop at nothing and will not abandon their hope of plunging it back into medieval darkness. To this end, military incursions from outside are being organized. Is it possible to solve the foreign policy aspect of this problem? Yes, it is. The way to do that is to stop forming, arming and infiltrating into the country from outside gangs of anti-government bandits and saboteurs and not to interfere in the internal affairs of Afghanistan. There can be no doubt that Afghanistan has followed, and will continue to follow, the path it has chosen—the path of independence, freedom, social progress, peace and nonalignment.",UNGD

We are convinced that the time is ripe to take the most serious notice of the fact that certain States, living set out to achieve military superiority and to pursue the policy of terrorism in international affairs, have resorted to actions designed to undermine the socio-political systems of other States.",UNGD

There is a very long list of documents, decisions, resolutions and various provisions to which States have affixed their seals and which specifically provide that it is inadmissible for countries to interfere in the internal affairs of others. Even the United Nations as a whole has no right to intervene in such matters. It is only necessary to look at Article 2 of the Charter of the United Nations, which states precisely that. When that Article was discussed and adopted in the course of the discussion and adoption of the Charter, everyone solemnly and unanimously supported the idea that not even the United Nations should have the right to intervene in the internal affairs of States.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"170.	Yet, flagrant violations of this international law are being committed today before the eyes of the world, while those responsible say that they are acting in such a way simply because they do not HI the social system of some State or other. This destroys the very possibility of ensuring peaceful relations and mutual trust among States and increases the threat of war. Such policies and actions flout the international rules of conduct. They cannot be tolerated and must be terminated. The United Nations, in our view, should speak out emphatically in support of the rule of law in international relations.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"171.	In the light of what I have said, the Soviet Union is submitting to the General Assembly for its consideration an important and urgent item entitled ""Inadmissibility of the policy of State terrorism and any actions by States aimed at undermining the socio-political system of other sovereign States"".",UNGD
RUS,1984,"172.	We propose that the United Nations resolutely condemn the policy and practice of State terrorism as a method of dealing with other countries and peoples.

Today, as always, our country believes in the maintenance of normal relations with the United States—and there has been much talk about this. Until the recent past, that is precisely how these relations were developing, although not without certain vicissitudes, whereas in the years of the Second World War they were relations of allies.",UNGD
RUS,1984,"176.	In recent years these relations have been disrupted through the efforts of Washington. They have spared no effort to destroy all the gains accomplished together and to undermine the trust that had been built up earlier. What is more, they all but flaunt their indifference to the reputation of the United States side as a partner in international affairs. Yet, that is not something to flaunt.",UNGD
RUS,1984,177.	History does not begin on the day when a particular United States Administration comes into office. The periods when the two Powers combined their efforts to defeat fascism will stand out as the best pages in the history of Soviet United States relations; and those who determine United States policy today have a great deal to do if they wish their words and the obligations they assume to be trusted. No attempts to substitute modifications in form for the substance of a policy and for the need to move away from militarism towards a policy of peace can be meaningful. That is nothing but an empty vessel. What is required is the determination to make such a move if one is truly guided by good intentions in United States Soviet relations and is really working towards peace. That alone can carry some weight on the political scales.,UNGD
RUS,1984,"178.	The Soviet Union believes that it is precisely concrete deeds, not verbal assurances that can lead to normalizing the situation in our relations with the United States.

We regard the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America, which make up the majority of the Movement of Nonaligned Countries—an influential force in the world today—as our fellow fighters in the struggle between those who work for peace and those who work against it.

It is our firm conviction that it is possible to correct the current alarming tilt in international developments, to halt the arms race and to set it on a downward spiral, to reduce and then totally eliminate the threat of war.

Aggravations of international tension have alternated with periods when that tension abated; international crises have sprung up and have been overcome, some of them being so acute as to bring mankind to the verge of catastrophe.

It can be remedied only if there is an understanding, as has been pointed out by Mikhail S. Gorbachev, of the ""realities and the dangers which we will inevitably face tomorrow if today those who can and must take the only correct decision evade the responsibility incumbent on them"".",UNGD
RUS,1985,"We perceive the greatest peril in the fact that the nuclear arms race has, at it were, made a fresh start and is forging ahead. Added to this there is the threat of the arms race spreading to outer space. There is a great possibility of the arms race acquiring an uncontrollable and irreversible character. In the final analysis, this is the road leading to a nuclear catastrophe.",UNGD
RUS,1985,"It is also alarming that of late it has not been possible to settle a single regional conflict or to eliminate .a single hotbed of military tension. In the meantime the flames of ""local"" wars, more often than not undeclared, have been responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands, and indeed hundreds of thousands. Mankind is suffering through being denied the opportunity to deal with such urgent problems as those relating to food, ecology, energy, population and the constantly widening economic gap between the developed and the developing countries. It has been denied that opportunity because the intellectual and material resources needed to find a radical solution to these problems common to all mankind are being squandered on the arms race.",UNGD
RUS,1985,"Not a single twist in the arms race spiral was initiated by the Soviet Union. It is only in response to actions of the other side and out of legitimate concern for our own security and that of our allies and friends, concern for international security as a whole, that we have developed or are developing this or that weapon system.",UNGD
RUS,1985,"Moreover, as early as 1946, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics proposed that nuclear weapons should be banned for all time. We have been advocating this ever since, and this remains our position now. we have been proposing and continue to propose that agreement should be reached on renouncing all weapons of mass destruction, reducing and totally eliminating their existing stockpiles, and cutting down armed forces and conventional armaments. Our country has come out with a proposed on general and complete disarmament under strict international control.",UNGD
RUS,1985,"These radical proposals have yet to be implemented, and it is the United States and some other NATO countries, rather than the soviet union, that are to blame for this fact.",UNGD
RUS,1985,"It is precisely because of their refusal to follow the example of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, which has also unilaterally pledged not to be the first to use nuclear weapons, that the threat of nuclear war continues to hang over the world.",UNGD
RUS,1985,"None the less, due to the vigorous efforts of the Soviet Union and other peace-loving States a number of treaties and agreements limiting the arms race in major areas have been concluded. These are the 1963 Moscow Treaty Banning Nuclear-Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under water, the 1968 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear weapons, the Treaty on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems and the SALT I Agreement, signed in 1972, and the 1979 SALT II treaty. All these treaties, which have served in large measure to reinforce strategic stability, became possible because political realism was also displayed by the then leaders of the united States and other western countries.",UNGD
RUS,1985,"It is not the fault of the Soviet Union that local conflicts break out and are raging in various regions of the world. The only thing that we could be ""guilty"" of is that we have invariably been and remain on the side of the peoples threatened by imperialism and of the States upon whose sovereignty and generally recognized rights imperialism is encroaching.",UNGD
RUS,1985,"As regards the increasingly acute economic problems common to all mankind, the Soviet Union has consistently been in favor of uniting the efforts of all States and peoples with a view to finding a rational solution to those problems. This is the thrust of the proposals made by our country, by all Warsaw Treaty member countries, for a drastic reduction in the military expenditures of States, and above all of the major Powers.",UNGD
RUS,1985,"These are all facts, which cannot be disputed.",UNGD
RUS,1985,"Responsibility for the current critical state of international relations rests with another group of countries, namely, the United States and some of its closest allies.",UNGD
RUS,1985,"It was they who, in the early 1980s, wrecked the structure of negotiations which had taken such an effort to build, negotiations which had shown signs of progress towards agreements in many areas ranging from complete and general prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests to the limitation of sales and supplies of conventional armaments, from banning the development of anti-satellite systems to limiting military activities in the Indian Ocean. It was the united States that refused to ratify the SALT II treaty designed to pave the way to further, ever more substantial cuts in strategic arms. It was the United States that in 1983 torpedoed the Soviet-United States talks on the limitation of nuclear arms in Europe by embarking on the deployment of its new nuclear missiles on the European continent.",UNGD
RUS,1985,"And the new military programs which now cover not only the land, oceans and atmosphere of our planet but also outer space are United States programs too.",UNGD
RUS,1985,No particular perspicacity is needed to see clearly that precisely those States that are obstructing disarmament efforts are also set on fomenting local conflicts. They bear responsibility for the failure thus far to come to grips with problems common to all mankind.,UNGD
RUS,1985,"All of this is being said not for the sake of polemics but in order that the United Nations may, on the basis of real facts and through concerted efforts, devise effective ways of radically improving international relations and strengthening universal security.",UNGD
RUS,1985,What are these ways as we see them?,UNGD
RUS,1985,"It is said at times that all that is needed is that the two super-Powers should stop competing with each other for influence in the world. This proposition stems either from ignorance or from malicious intent. First, the Soviet Union has no intention of placing itself above other States and peoples, nor is it seeking opportunities to order them about or dictate its will to them. Secondly, the Soviet Union is not involved in any competition whatsoever, whether for markets, natural resources, control over sea or air routes, or the possession of outer space.",UNGD
RUS,1985,"On the other hand, it is of course true that the Soviet Union is one of the world's two most powerful nations. But the whole point is what political aims are served by that Power. Those who invoke the concept of the ""two super-Powers"" would ' be well advised to ponder once in a while what would happen to their independence and what turn world developments would generally take if the USSR were weaker than it is and if the Soviet people were not investing so such of their effort, material resources and scientific endeavor in maintaining its economic and military potential at an adequate level.",UNGD
RUS,1985,"In discussions about the ways of improving the situation frequent mention is also made of the need to restore, above all, confidence among States. This, it is said, would make it possible to resolve all major problems, including those of halting the arms race and settling regional conflicts. Indeed, confidence is an important factor in overcoming the current difficulties. We feel, however, that it is impossible to achieve a necessary and reliable degree of trust in relations among States unless the causes and the material roots of distrust are removed.",UNGD
RUS,1985,"But work to restore confidence must be pursued, and that is what we are doing. In particular, at the Stockholm Conference of states participating in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, the soviet union is working for the adoption of a complex of large-scale, effective political, military and technical confidence-building measures. At Stockholm we are now prepared to proceed immediately, together with our negotiating partners, to the actual drafting of agreements to that effect. Our country attaches major importance to the pan-European process as a whole.",UNGD
RUS,1985,"The Soviet Union is building and developing its relations with all States in strict compliance with the Final Act and on the basis of the 10 principles proclaimed therein. It attaches special importance to the factor of confidence in those relations, and it is pleased when it sees that this factor is present in its relations with various countries in Europe, America, Asia, Africa or Oceania.",UNGD
RUS,1985,In our relations with other States we have always given priority to the search for ways of easing international tension and averting the danger of war. Of great importance in this context is the forthcoming visit of Mikhail Gorbachev to France.,UNGD
RUS,1985,"We also want to build normal, stable relations with the United States. We have never been the initiators of confrontation between the Soviet Union and the United States. We do not believe that the tensions today in Soviet-American relations result from an inevitable clash of national interests. We therefore believe that both sides have an interest in the successful outcome of the forthcoming meeting between the leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States. This is precisely how the Soviet Union approaches that meeting. It remains to be seen what will be the attitude of the other side in this matter.",UNGD
RUS,1985,"We are convinced that the Soviet-American summit meeting should focus on the most important problem of the day, the problem upon whose solution truly depends on the possibility of decisively reducing the danger of war, restoring international trust and creating the conditions necessary for resolving many other pressing issues in relations among States. The problem I am referring to is that of preventing an arms race in cuter space and ending the arms race on earth, limiting and reducing nuclear arms and enhancing strategic stability. I will address this question in somewhat greater detail.",UNGD
RUS,1985,"To begin with, it would appear indisputable that as long as States possess nuclear weapons the risk of the outbreak of nuclear war cannot be completely ruled out. It is equally true, however, that in conditions of strategic equilibrium, that risk is comparatively lower, for strategic equilibrium means essentially that each side, even if it became a victim of nuclear aggression committed by the other side, would retain sufficient strategic capacity to strike an equally devastating blow to the aggressor. Consequently, in conditions of strategic equilibrium there could be no winner in a nuclear war and starting one would be tantamount to committing suicide.",UNGD
RUS,1985,"Yet the situation might change if one side should try to acquire such a nuclear potential as would encourage it to think that by a single strike it could deprive the other side of adequate retaliatory capacity against aggression, particularly if the potential aggressor should develop a space-based anti-missile shield and count on it to protect itself against a retaliatory strike. It is obvious that in such case the aggressor might be tempted to deliver or threaten to deliver a first ""disarming"" nuclear strike - as it is now known - counting on its immunity to retaliation. Hence the extreme danger inherent in any bid for military superiority in a nuclear age. Yet this is precisely the purpose of the new United States military programs, work on which has already begun or is about to begin.",UNGD
RUS,1985,It could be argued that this is a purely hypothetical danger since the Soviet Union has repeatedly stated that it would not allow the other side to achieve superiority and would take appropriate counter-measures to restore the balance.,UNGD
RUS,1985,But would that mean that the problem of the danger of nuclear war would simply disappear?,UNGD
RUS,1985,"It is true that our country would not permit military superiority over it. The State and Party leadership of the Soviet Union has instructed me to reaffirm this once again in this United Nations forum. Those who may expect that the Soviet economy would not be able to stand up to the strain of the qualitatively new stage in the arms race which is currently being forced upon us are profoundly mistaken. Our country and the Soviet economy have had to withstand even greater pressures. Today, the economic might of the Soviet State and its scientific and technological potential are such as to leave no doubt whatever in anyone's mind concerning the ability and determination of our people to meet that new challenge.",UNGD
RUS,1985,"However, it should not be forgotten that the higher the level of military confrontation in this nuclear and space age, the more shaky and the less secure, even if strategic equilibrium is maintained, become the foundations of world peace. Nuclear war in these conditions could result not only from a deliberate decision but also from attempts at blackmail or from miscalculation by one side as to the intentions or actions of the other. It could also break out as a consequence of someone's reckless behavior prompted by a sudden aggravation of the situation or because of malfunctions of computers, which are being increasingly relied upon in the operation of modern, sophisticated weapons systems.",UNGD
RUS,1985,Such is our understanding of the current strategic and political realities. It is based on grim facts that cannot be ignored.,UNGD
RUS,1985,"It is precisely for this reason that the Soviet Union has been so persistent in seeking not merely the maintenance but a lowering of the existing level of strategic equilibrium and the early adoption of effective measures to stop and reverse the arms race. We know - and many other States now realize this too - that there is no more time to waste, for it may turn out to be too late.",UNGD
RUS,1985,,UNGD
RUS,1985,"We have gathered in New York in the final days of the first month of autumn. It is a time associated in many countries with the harvest, when farmers look to the coming winter with a feeling of work well done. This thought brings to mind another metaphor which, regrettably, has already taken root in the vocabulary of mankind - the metaphor of the ""nuclear winter"", we want the word ""winter"" in all the languages of the world to retain its one and only meaning, its original meaning and to be identified solely with the season of the year which is so beautiful and joyful.",UNGD
RUS,1985,"In an attempt to establish a favorable climate for the resumption of the process of arms limitation and reduction, and, ultimately, the complete elimination of nuclear weapons everywhere, the Soviet Union has recently taken some substantial steps on a unilateral - I stress ""unilateral"" - basis. These steps include the decision not to place anti-satellite weapons in outer space so long as the United States does not do so. Unfortunately, however, the united States, disregarding the interests of political and military stability, recently tested an anti-satellite weapon against a target in space. Those steps also include the suspension of further implementation of our counter-measures in Europe consequent upon the deployment of united States medium-range nuclear systems on the territories of some Western European countries. Finally, there is our moratorium on nuclear explosions.",UNGD
RUS,1985,"It is clear that by their very nature such unilateral steps could not be taken as measures of unlimited duration; but they could be of unlimited duration if the United States followed our good example. That would constitute significant progress towards a relaxation of military tension in the world. If, however, the United States fails to heed the voice of reason, no one will be able to blame us when the unilateral moratoriums we have declared come to an end as their terms expire. It is not for us but for the United States to make the choice.",UNGD
RUS,1985,"Notwithstanding the importance of such steps as moratoriums designed to curb the arms race, the peoples of the world have every right to demand that radical measures be taken to reduce and eventually eliminate nuclear - and not only nuclear - weapons.",UNGD
RUS,1985,"From the very beginning of the Geneva negotiations on nuclear and space weapons our country has been determined to achieve a radical solution to these interrelated problems and has taken a constructive position. The Soviet delegation had brought to the current round of negotiations substantial, large-scale and far-reaching proposals, we believe that agreement to ban space-strike weapons and to bring about truly radical reductions in nuclear arms would today have the most positive effect. Such an agreement could bring about a turn for the better in the entire course of world events, avert the threat of nuclear catastrophe and open up for the peoples of the world the prospect of a world free from fear for tomorrow. Mankind would be moving towards the new millennium which is already almost with us, confident that civilization would continue to advance.",UNGD
RUS,1985,"The Soviet Union has put forward proposals on the whole range of issues relating to the cessation of the arms race. I am not going to mention each of those proposals for all of them will, in one way or another, become the subject of an exchange of views at the General Assembly. Let me just say that they cover the nuclear field, including the cessation of nuclear tests, as well as chemical weapons, conventional weapons and the numerical strength of armed forces. In some cases it is a question of a freeze; in others of a reduction. The Soviet Union continues resolutely continues to support proposals to establish nuclear-weapon-free zones, chemical-weapon-free zones and zones of peace in various parts of the world. It favors a limitation of naval activities and naval armaments and resolutely opposes the development of any new weapons of mass destruction.",UNGD
RUS,1985,"In the context of the proposed arms limitation and reduction measures, the Soviet Union believes it necessary to provide for adequate measures of verification and control, in some cases national, and in others national combined with international, whenever there is an objective necessity for this. We have as great an interest as anyone in effective verification of compliance by all States with their obligations in connection with disarmament measures. We call upon the States represented in the united Nations General Assembly, both members of politico-military alliances and non-aligned and neutral countries, to support this approach, which we are convinced is constructive and at the same time realistic.",UNGD
RUS,1985,"I would now like to offer some ideas as to what might be done to eliminate, through our collective efforts, local wars and conflicts, which result in untold suffering and innumerable casualties.",UNGD
RUS,1985,"Viewed in a purely United Nations context, the solution to this problem may seem simple. All that is needed is to compel all States to comply fully and scrupulously in their actions with their commitments under the United Nations Charter and equally firmly to deny support to those who violate those commitments.",UNGD
RUS,1985,"For instance, it is hard to imagine that any delegation would venture to assert here that the monstrous crimes of the Israeli aggressors on the ravaged soil of Lebanon and in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip are consistent with the principles of the United Nations Charter or that the financing, arming, training and infiltrating into Nicaragua of thousands upon thousands of",UNGD
RUS,1985,"counter-revolutionaries - contras, as they are called - are consistent with those principles.",UNGD

RUS,1985,"Who is unaware of the brutal record of the South African apartheid regime, which is executing hundreds of the country's indigenous inhabitants and jailing thousands of others? Who is unaware of the acts of aggression it is constantly committing against Angola - as we see today - as well as against Mozambique, Botswana and Lesotho? It would indeed be blasphemous even to think that this inhuman regime acts in accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Charter. But it is a fact that the Pretoria racists receive support, and that this support comes from a major Power that 40 years ago was among the founding Members of the United Nations.",UNGD
RUS,1985,"Of course, expressing indignation at the crimes of the racists and condemning the aggressor does not in itself mean that those crimes will be eliminated. The peaceful settlement of any given conflict with full and just regard for the legitimate interests of all sides requires a political basis for a settlement which would not be prejudicial to those interests, as well as a negotiating mechanism appropriate to each specific conflict situation.",UNGD
RUS,1985,Such political platforms for the just settlement of all or nearly all existing regional conflicts have already been or are being formulated. Suitable negotiating mechanisms either already exist or can be established.,UNGD
RUS,1985,"Let us now turn to the situation in the Middle Bast. The main parameters for solving the Middle Bast problem in a manner that would take into account the legitimate interests of all parties have long ago been defined. They include the return to the Arab States of all their territories occupied by Israel since 1967, the exercise of the right of the Arab people of Palestine to establish an independent State of their own and ensuring the right of all States in the Middle East, including Israel, to live in peace and security. A negotiating mechanism for such a settlement has long ago been proposed as well, namely, an international conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations with the participation of all the parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization, and a number of other countries, including the Soviet Union and the United States.",UNGD
RUS,1985,"There may, however, be some people who think that the Middle East knot can be untied by separate deals, but experience has already shown that such actions can only result in aggravating the conflict instead of settling it. We believe that this year the Genial Assembly will take an even firmer stand in favor of an early and just political settlement in the Middle East, and will demand that those who continue to resist such a settlement should stop their sabotage.",UNGD
RUS,1985,"I should like to recall, in this connection, that Israel ewes its very existence to a decision of this organization, a decision which also called for the establishment in Palestine of an Arab State. It was a dual decision. The Soviet Union actively supported precisely that decision and, incidentally, it was among the first to recognize the State of Israel.",UNGD
RUS,1985,"In principle, a negotiating mechanism also exists for settling the situation in Central America which was indeed conceived by the Latin American countries themselves. I am referring to the Contadora group^ with which several more South American States, recently expressed solidarity. There is also a draft act of peace in Central America drawn up by the Contadora members. It is widely supported by the States and peoples of the region, including the Government and the people of Nicaragua, the country which is the target of the spearhead of imperialist aggression. It is important for the United Nations to support the efforts of the Contadora group and contribute to overcoming the resistance of those who, instead of peace, seek to restore their domination in Central America.",UNGD

What is necessary for this is that everyone should recognize the right of the Afghan people to build their life as they wish and that armed and other forms of outside interference in the internal affairs of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan should be ended. When such interference is ended, and if there is a guarantee that it will not be resumed, it will then become possible to withdraw from Afghanistan, by agreement with the Afghan Government- the Soviet military contingent.

Forty years have gone by since that time but, regrettably, to this very day flagrant, massive violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms are taking place.

RUS,1986,"Unfortunately, in some countries the institutions of democracy are being outweighed by the immoral arithmetic of military superiority. But it is an indisputable fact that the call for action is no longer a voice crying in the wilderness. On the contrary, even in the wilderness of the Nevada desert calls are being heard for an end to nuclear testing. The Nevada explosions are new registered not only by us but also by United States scientists with their instruments installed near the Soviet city of Semipalatinsk.",UNGD
RUS,1986,"At the same time, not a single seismograph in the world is registering nuclear explosions on our territory - not because of any lack of sensitivity on the part of the instruments, but because the Soviet Union is responsive to the will of the world community.",UNGD
RUS,1986,"In pursuing the foreign policy proclaimed at the Twenty-seventh Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, our co lei try is taking specific, practical steps. One of the most important is the unilateral moratorium on nuclear explosions. This is precisely the kind of action that proves the sincerity of our intentions and the seriousness of our concern for the future of the world.",UNGD
RUS,1986,"For more than a year now the Soviet testing sites have remained silent. Listen to this silence? it is very eloquent. If it were accompanied by a similar silence at United States test sites, that more than any words would tell mankind that what we are witnessing was the beginning of a movement towards realizing the",UNGD

RUS,1986,"In its determination to make this a reality, the Soviet Union, together with other socialist countries, has submitted proposals on this subject for the Assembly's consideration.

RUS,1986,"The sponsors of this proposal make no claim to have discovered a hitherto unknown political ""continent"". If there are any blank spots today they exist mainly in the field of concrete, practical measures. To clear the way for such action would indeed be a discovery of the highest order. The proposed bases for security are consonant with the principles of the United Nations Charter and designed to promote their implementation within the specific conditions of our day. Here, we are looking forward to a most democratic and constructive discussion and the collective creative efforts of all countries.",UNGD
RUS,1986,"The idea of comprehensive security presupposes first and foremost material guarantees of peace, political and international legal safeguards and the establishment of principles of civilized and respectful relations among States. A safe world is a world of law and order, in which there is strict compliance with the united Nations Charter and respect for all rules of international law, for human rights and freedoms.",UNGD
RUS,1986,"Our initiative contains an answer to the question of what should be done to save life on Earth. As we speak of this the abandoned villages in the area of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant stand before our eyes. That accident has meant for us more than grief over our losses and compassion for its victims. It has reinforced our anxiety for the future of the Earth. Chernobyl was a tragic mistake on the part of human beings working with the peaceful atom. But still less are there any guarantees against mistakes with the military uses of the atom. Given the existence in the world of 50,000 nuclear warheads, we are living on borrowed time and no one knows when that time will run out.",UNGD

RUS,1986,"It is within the powers of the international community, the sole sovereign master of its own fate to do this. No single nuclear Power has the right to take decisions on behalf of all, and the USSR refuses to do so. In his historic statement of 15 January, the Soviet leader proposed something quite different - to scrap all nuclear weapons. Once again the criterion is experience.",UNGD
RUS,1986,Political responsibility is the opposite of political arrogance. The problem of nuclear testing clearly highlights these mutually incompatible approaches.,UNGD
RUS,1986,"There are other facts. Look at the fate of the SALT I and SALT II treaties. They are being torn up now because they allow no room for equipping a 131st bomber with cruise missiles. One thousand, five hundred such missiles seemed too few, so",UNGD

RUS,1986,"The tribunal of history is merciless in its verdicts. If political leaders fail to take timely and responsible decisions, history will not forgive them. We have a chance to lay the foundations for lasting peace. Of course it is not just a matter of adopting yet another resolution. The United Nations must establish a system of values which gives the highest priority to practical actions.",UNGD
RUS,1986,"Let ma emphasize that this is being stated by the representative of a nuclear Power. We never wanted to acquire nuclear weapons, but from the time we were forced to acquire them we have constantly sought to limit, reduce and eliminate them. We are not the last member of the ""nuclear club"", but we are proposing its dissolution. Let there be no mistake - we have our pride like anyone else. However, the prestige and dignity of a great Power are things we associate with the",UNGD
RUS,1986,equal security of all.,UNGD
RUS,1986,We are motivated by our sense of responsibility both to our own people and to other peoples. It is for this reason precisely that we are willing to agree to sensible compromises and make realistic concessions when we put forward proposals for the reduction of strategic offensive weapons and medium-range missiles. This reflects the new approach to the realities of the nuclear space age outlined most fully and comprehensively in Mikhail Gorbachev's report to the Twenty-Seventh Congress of our Party.,UNGD
RUS,1986,The sincerity of our intentions and the integrity of our position are matched by our determination to put an end to the dangerous course of world events. We are putting so much emphasis on the renunciation of nuclear-weapon tests because it is precisely this that is the real test of the sincerity of declarations.,UNGD
RUS,1986,"Yesterday we heard the statement of the President of the United States. It is regrettable that the rostrum of the General Assembly was used in such a way. To respond point by point to that statement presents no problem. However, to enter into polemics would be to show a lack of respect for our audience. The subject under discussion is far too serious to turn it into a grindstone for sharpening political wit. Time is too precious to be wasted on refuting misconceptions and prejudices that distort reality and facts.",UNGD
RUS,1986,"Nevertheless, there is one key point to which we must refer, because it is of fundamental importance. I am referring to the attempt to provide a philosophical rationale for the assertion that new sophisticated military technology is capable of reliably ensuring security. It is precisely that kind of philosophy that caused the tidal wave of armaments which has been growing year after year and now threatens to obliterate the Earth.",UNGD
RUS,1986,There is only one path to security - destroying existing weapons instead of replacing them with new ones. The technology of destruction must not be allowed to determine policy.,UNGD

RUS,1986,"I have been authorized to state that the Soviet Union is ready, at any time and anywhere, to sign a treaty on the total prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests. We are ready to do so here at the United Nations, so that the entire world community could become part of this great act and historical turning-point which would be a sign of respect for its will.",UNGD
RUS,1986,"Words not matched by deeds are worthless, but words supported by deeds are a country's gold reserve.",UNGD

RUS,1986,"verification, the Soviet Union is open to any form or method of verification.",UNGD
RUS,1986,"In our view the summit conference of the non-aligned countries at Harare made some very valuable recommendations in this respect. The United Nations could support the proposals of the Delhi Six - Argentina, Greece, India, Mexico, Tanzania and Sweden - on monitoring compliance with the obligation not to carry out nuclear tests. The Soviet Union will accept recommendations formulated under the auspices of the United Nations.",UNGD
RUS,1986,We agree with those States which believe that the question whether mankind will live in a nuclear or a nuclear-free world must be decided by the whole world community and not by a small group of nuclear Powers.,UNGD
RUS,1986,"This also applies fully to the future of outer space, for near-Earth space is the common heritage of mankind and should be used for the benefit of all. However, if weapons gat into space, this heritage would become a threat to all? just two or three States enjoying the status of military-space Powers would then dominate the rest of the world.",UNGD
RUS,1986,"Is that what we want? Do we want a military-space fiefdom to be established? The question is posed by the course of events, which may become tragic for",UNGD

RUS,1986,"Today those designs are being camouflaged with high-sounding pronouncements about a defense program, which supposedly would do away with the threat of attack once and for all. One hears moving and soul-stirring stories about a dream which when realized would free mankind from the fear of nuclear death. Evil designs are being purveyed as good intentions, and swords as shields.",UNGD
RUS,1986,"Let no one be misled by such talk. It serves to conceal an attack against the main pillar of stability, the anti-ball is tic-missile Treaty. The intention is to get the Treaty out of the way within a time frame of seven years. Here everything is being very carefully calculated, for it is precisely in seven years that they plan to prepare space weapons for deployment.",UNGD
RUS,1986,"The question is. What for? Would it not be more sensible to work for an agreement on the complete elimination of nuclear missiles, whether strategic, medium-range or any other, as we are proposing?",UNGD
RUS,1986,"The answer is simple; whatever is done to disguise it, the so-called defensive space shield is being designed to carry out a first strike with impunity. The first strike could become the last one, and not just for the country being attacked. Space weapons, like nuclear arms, do not recognize national boundaries, and they do not choose whom to spare and whom to destroy. And in any circumstances they could threaten, not one country or several countries, but the entire world.",UNGD
RUS,1986,"Therefore we consider it necessary to warn everybody that if space is to remain peaceful everyone must protect it.In this, the United Nations, the only legitimate trustee of peace in outer space, should make its voice heard.",UNGD
RUS,1986,We also call for the help of the United Nations in regard to a matter of extreme importance - the elimination of chemical weapons. Encouraging progress has been achieved at the Geneva Conference.,UNGD
RUS,1986,"The historic goal of ridding the earth of chemical weapons is new closer to attainment. The only thing that could hinder the attainment of that goal is the position of the United states, which is seeking to develop binary weapons. However, obstacles can be removed if political will is evinced - and this Organization is quite capable of stimulating it.",UNGD
RUS,1986,"A comprehensive system of international security has more than nuclear, space or chemical parameters. Security implies the non-use of any force, including conventional armaments and armed forces.",UNGD
RUS,1986,"The Soviet Union calls for a significant reduction in the level of military confrontation, above all between politico-military alliances. Radical proposals to that effect, based on the concept of reasonable sufficiency, have been made by the States members of the Warsaw Treaty.",UNGD

RUS,1986,"A beginning has already been made in the Stockholm forum, and all of us - not just the Europeans - can congratulate ourselves and each other on this triumph of reason and good will. It has given us something more than just a major agreement. It has demonstrated that when we really want something, we can achieve it. It has confirmed that the Helsinki process is being successfully developed and has taken deep roots in European soil. It is now extremely important that the forthcoming meeting in Vienna should become yet another milestone in Europe's advance towards reliable security and improved co-operation.",UNGD
RUS,1986,The Asian and Pacific region should also be allowed to breathe freely. Our ideas in this regard are incorporated in a concrete program of action that was outlined in Mikhail Gorbachev's address in Vladivosfaock. We are encouraged that this program has proved to be in harmony with the feelings of many States of the region.,UNGD
RUS,1986,"We are aware of all the sore spots existing in the region. First of all, there is the Korean peninsula. The people of Korea yearn for an aid to the division of their country.

RUS,1986,"Measures to eliminate regional conflicts would form an organic part of the concept of comprehensive security. Of course, there is not, nor can there be, a uniform model for a political settlement here. Nevertheless, concrete expression must be given to some general principles.

RUS,1986,"We believe that the United Nations should again take the matter of a Middle East settlement into its hands.

Various options have been tried, but the proposal that the problem of Cyprus be settled at a representative international conference under the auspices of the United Nations has been studiously evaded. Who stands to gain from that? Only those forces which intend to use the island for their military and political plans. Raising the stick of ""neo-globalism"" over the Mediterranean, they would like to turn the entire region into a hotbed of tension. They sometimes use that stick without giving any thought to the consequences, as was done with barbaric cruelty in Libya.",UNGD

RUS,1986,"It is our conviction that were it not for the racist regime of Pretoria the black, white and colored people in South Africa would have long ago found a common language - a language of equality, concord and racial peace.

To fail to see that is to encourage, wittingly or unwittingly, genocide against the majority of the South African people.",UNGD

RUS,1986,"Recently, a new and ugly phenomenon of ""prepaid"" regional conflicts has appeared in international practice. A graphic example is Nicaragua, into which millions of dollars are being channeled to finance the massacre of peasants and the destruction of villages and plantations - only because that small country has dared to choose its own way of development which, in the eyes of the administration of the world's largest and most powerful capitalist nation, appears to pose a threat to its security.",UNGD
RUS,1986,"The undeclared wars against the legitimate Governments of Afghanistan, Kampuchea, Angola, Mozambique and Ethiopia are paid for in exactly the same way. And quite often the country financing a conflict maintains diplomatic relations or conducts negotiations with the Government concerned, while at the same time seeking to overthrow it by any means. Indeed, it does not mind the cost when blacklisting Governments and countries which, for some reason or other, it finds inconvenient. Thus, the entire range of reprisals, from direct military to economic and ideological, has been used against the Republic of Cuba for more than a quarter of a century. But surely it is high time to understand that such a policy is bankrupt and that it can only be described as insane.",UNGD
RUS,1986,"Political wisdom dictates acknowledging the established realities and not seeking to undo them arbitrarily. Describing gangs of mercenaries as ""freedom fighters"" - which is attempted in the war against Afghanistan - does not help. The time has come to learn to call things by their own names. With regard to Afghanistan, a national democratic revolution has taken place there. Its social base is constantly becoming broader and stronger; it relies on the support and participation of all social strata and ethnic groups in that country without any exception. They have a clear-cut program for a peaceful settlement of crisis phenomena, and all that is needed is not to hamper that positive process. Here again, the Soviet Union is in favor of seeking new solutions and a fresh approach, unobscured by prejudice, that would help to identify ways of solving the problem with due regard for the legitimate interests of the Afghan people and of its friends and neighbors.",UNGD

No sane person can live with it. Terrorism must be mercilessly eradicated, for innocent people suffer and die because of it. But to combat it effectively we also should see its causes. One should not ignore the nature of that abhorrent phenomenon: outbursts of individual and group terror are sometimes engendered by imperialist violence against entire peoples. An improvement in the overall international situation would do much to help stamp out terrorism.",UNGD

And while politicians, futurologists and experts are trying somehow to model a structure of security in a world with or without weapons, no one can come even close to predicting the economic consequences of the situation as it evolves. Yet the explosion with which it is fraught would be no less catastrophic than a possible malfunction in the technologies of war.",UNGD
RUS,1986,"Today, militarism is not only jeopardizing man's physical survival but his socio-economic progress as well. The cost of the arms race is reaching a level comparable to the material damage caused by past world wars. All of this makes disarmament imperative.",UNGD
RUS,1986,"Against the background of the uncontrollable crisis affecting the world economic structure we see with particular clarity the increasingly prevalent process of purging out resources from the national economies of the developing countries of Latin America, Africa and other regions. In the early 1980s the developing world, exploited by imperialism, was pushed into a vicious circle of development via debt, and it now finds itself hung up in the noose of a trillion dollar indebtedness. This, in effect, means that regions with the world's greatest concentration of population, resources and future markets are sliding towards economic catastrophe.",UNGD
RUS,1986,"That is why we regard economic security as an integral part of a comprehensive system of international security.

We are strongly in favor of expanded international co-operation in implementing political, social and individual human rights, and we urge everyone to take a fresh, unbiased look at that problem. Specifically, at the Bern meeting the Soviet Union proposed that steps be taken by all States bring their domestic legislation on the whole range of humanitarian problems into conformity with international norms. Unfortunately, another approach emerged at the Bern meeting, one that ignores the consensus among most of the participants in that dialog.

Lately, the States Members of the United Nations have begun to ask with increasing frequency whether the United Nations can function normally in a country whose Government shows such undisguised disrespect for them and for the Organization itself. Perhaps that question should be heeded. It might be useful to hold a special debate in the United Nations on the numerous accumulated problems of the operation of the Organization.",UNGD
RUS,1986,"The Organization's universality implies a forward thrust towards rapprochement and towards the elimination of centrifugal forces. In light of the proposed concept of comprehensive security, the East-West, North-South polarities can and must be expunged from the political vocabulary. That is what socialism is calling for. Whatever its antagonists assert, socialism is opposed to confrontation and intransigence in the most important pursuit of mankind: the construction of a durable and guaranteed peace. We have adopted that system of priorities in our relationship with the United States as well. This question has already been addressed here yesterday. Let me say that we are far from regarding our relations with the United States as holding no promise particularly since we have a high regard for the American people. Lately, encouraging outlines of meaningful agreements have been emerging. A summit meeting is also a realistic possibility. We could move forward fairly smoothly, if that is what the United States side wants. We are realists, and we do not draw inspiration from Utopian ideas. At the end of the last century, people envisioned the coming twentieth century as a golden age. But reality has dashed those expectations.

RUS,1987,"Today, Lenin's Decree of Peace is perceived as a message of supreme morality addressed to our time. The repudiation of secret treaties, open and public conduct of International affairs, the immediate withdrawal from the war and the rejection of War as a method of resolving conflicts reflected, even as far back as 1917, a common need, which has now become the will of the entire International community.",UNGD
RUS,1987,"A long and difficult road must be traversed for human thought to become action, but it does happen sooner or later. When, in Washington, we were discussing the techniques of the destruction of nuclear warheads we were suddenly struck by the fact that only a year ago this had seemed something well beyond our grasp. Our American partners can confirm this. It is hard to find words to express this. Let us just say that the past gives a powerful impetus to the present, and the present gives guarantees to the future.",UNGD
RUS,1987,"""The reality and the guarantees of a secure world"" is the title of Mikhail Gorbachev's article published before this session began, and it conveys the gist of our thinking today.",UNGD
RUS,1987,"A secure world is possible. It Is possible because anything else is too dangerous. The possibility of a secure world is commensurate with the need for it This is the reality. As for guarantees, we see them in a comprehensive system of security. It is the natural task of the United Nations to give inspiration to and take the lead in building such a system.",UNGD
RUS,1987,"This, reduced to a concise formula, is the logic of that article, which develops the doctrine of a secure world. It stems from the history of our country and is the fruit of political thinking that honestly analyses the entire preceding period.",UNGD
RUS,1987,"In this context I would venture to remind the Assembly that its forty-second session coincides with the eve of the seventieth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. This is our celebration and we are not imposing it on anyone. The feelings aroused by the birthday of our State are ours. Nevertheless, I would venture to share with representatives my thoughts on some of the international implications of that date.",UNGD
RUS,1987,"I do not think that it can be disputed that the October Revolution was one of the major events of this century and has had a tremendous impact on the destinies of peoples, not only those of the former Russian Empire. We think that the process of renovation which is under way in our country is more than just a strictly domestic affair of the Soviet Union, It is impossible to describe as purely the concern of the Soviet Union its desire to do away with one of the products of the cold war, which is the splitting of the world into hostile alliances.",UNGD
RUS,1987,"All this, naturally, is also part of the objectives of perestroika - our process of change - while glasnost - openness - and dialogue are, as logically, its instruments, in both domestic and foreign policies. Between these two there exists a direct and open relationship and one cannot be implemented without the other. This, and this alone, allows me, when speaking about the seventieth anniversary of our revolution, to invite you all to take thought together.",UNGD
RUS,1987,"If we have a concept of a world revolution, which is most closely linked with the process of revolutionary change in our country, we make no secret of it. It is this: organizing the entire human community on the basis of recognizing peace as the supreme value of existence, human life, freedom and dignity as a general yardstick, and peaceful coexistence as a universal principle of relations among States. This concept, proclaimed in the Political Report to the 27th Congress of our Communist Party, has been substantiated by a series of practical steps taken by the Soviet Union,",UNGD
RUS,1987,"Perestroika has also heralded major changes in international affairs. It should not be obstructed. But, of course, unlike the position in 1917 or 1918, in 1987 no external action could halt our revolution. Today we live in different times, and it is a different country. And that could be one of the greatest achievements of the October Revolution. The price of this was enormous. It was set by the foreign intervention and the civil war; the ruined economy and the economic blockade; terror and the attempts to subvert the foundations of our multinational State; Nazi aggression and the cold war, which was imposed on us; nuclear blackmail and constant attempts at political diktat. Not a single day passed without our having to pay the highest price.",UNGD
RUS,1987,"Unlike many other revolutions, the October Revolution was almost bloodless. Unlike many others, its architects never Intended to build their temple on blood; they never thought, as had many before them, that cruelty, violence and fear were the best glue for cementing their ideal.",UNGD
RUS,1987,"It was the policies of conspiracy, terror and intervention against Soviet Russia that made it shut and lock its doors and cut itself off from a hostile world. ",UNGD
RUS,1987,,UNGD
RUS,1987,"In order to survive it was necessary to do the maximum within the historically minimum space of time. A chronic lack of time and unending pressure on all fronts also helped create the conditions which resulted in innocent victims and irreparable losses. We are saying this for all to hear: there is not and there cannot be any justification for that. We do more than just say it. As heirs to both victories and defeats, achievements and mistakes, we are doing our utmost to consolidate the victories and to prevent even the slightest possibility of the errors being repeated In either domestic or in foreign policies. ",UNGD
RUS,1987,"This is a distinctive feature of our perestroika, its dominant trend, any indicator of the vigour and health of our society, a guarantee of Its future, of its profound internal democratism, openness and integrity. And there is no need to engage in linguistic research to try to provide listeners with an English equivalent of the word glasnost. One might go astray in a foreign language, as has indeed already happened with the same speaker, who claimed that there is no word meaning ""freedom"" in the Russian language. It is generally dangerous to play with words in this forum in which by no means everyone is ready to applaud insults summarily flung at entire countries and peoples. Freedom does indeed serve peace - but it is not the freedom that is interpreted as licence to interfere in the affairs of others and to finance counter-revolution as a most profitable business.",UNGD
RUS,1987,"As for our perestroika, no one should be a prey to illusions. We shall not turn aside from the main road or borrow from others their norms and rules of democracy. We thank them for their advice, but we shall conduct perestroika according to our own design, on our own socialist basis. Allow us to determine for ourselves what the Soviet Union is going to be and that will be what the Soviet people want it to be.",UNGD
RUS,1987,Those who want to support us will also support the project of rebuilding international relations on a broad democratic basis. They will support the concept of a nuclear-free world and all actions to resolve the knottiest issues of world politics. For here the interests of most members of the community fully coincide.,UNGD
RUS,1987,"This rostrum is not a pulpit for preaching ""free enterprise"". This Hall is not a schoolroom or a university auditorium in which one can teach lessons in rhetoric or lecture the international community on the manners of ""good political behaviour"". it is even less worthy to adopt the tone of pastoral admonition and tell the Organization that ""sometimes it has strayed"" and ""it is time for it to come home"". One can say, however, that this rostrum and this Hall are the very place where new political thinking should be expressed.",UNGD
RUS,1987,"However much the world is split by confrontation and hatred, it is United in facing the need to preserve itself and to perpetuate mankind.",UNGD
RUS,1987,"Prom this objective reality there emerges another guiding light for new political thinking; in our time, the correlation between the national interest and the interest of all mankind has changed. It has changed in the sense that truly national interests cannot be opposed to common interests.",UNGD
RUS,1987,"If, on the pretext that something is contrary to the interests of national security or to considerations of national prestige, one rejects everything that is born of the political thinking of the systems or governments that one does not like, then, sooner or later, this will boomerang on the genuine national interests of one's own people and State.",UNGD
RUS,1987,"New political thinking must put an end to that. New political thinking will put an end to it if it is put into action. And there is no doubt that it will be, for action, unity of concept and implementation, of thought and its realization, of word and deed, are crucial conditions for the existence of mankind.",UNGD
RUS,1987,"New political thinking will inevitably make its way, for it is nourished by some remarkable elements: by the accumulation of progressive political experience  by strictly scientific analysis, evaluation and forecasting of contemporary realities} and, ultimately, by the freedom of new political thinking from national narrow-mindedness that provokes animosity towards countries, groups of countries or social political systems.",UNGD
RUS,1987,"In this regard, let me say that the policy of hostility towards socialism is now bankrupt, both in theory and in practice. The very fact of the establishment of the United Nations contained the embryo of the new political thinking. Even at that time its principles were embodied in the articles of the United Nations Charter  which is undoubtedly one of the greatest statutory instruments of all time and of all nations.",UNGD
RUS,1987,"The fact that our Organization has been functioning for over 40 years now is testimony to the triumph of mankind's common interests over narrow-minded nationalism and great-Power attitudes. In fact, all the post-war decades have been nothing but the history of the struggle between outdated political concepts and the new political thinking that was born in the agony of war.",UNGD
RUS,1987,"When life on earth depends on one's ability to destroy it 20 times over, there is something wrong either with oneself and one's trust in such a guarantee of life, or with the very idea of deterrence. Most likely, it is both. New political thinking exposes the absurdity of the idea of safeguarding anyone's security with nuclear weapons.",UNGD
RUS,1987,"However, a question immediately arises: Is it possible to ensure peace by other methods and, indeed, do such methods exist at all? New political thinking answers: Yes. And here again I should like to focus on a comprehensive system of international security.",UNGD
RUS,1987,"As emerges clearly from Mikhail Gorbachev's statements, we envision its formation as a multilinear process extending over time and implemented through collective efforts. In essence, its objective is that peace should be ensured exclusively by the United Nations and its Security Council on the basis of strict observance of the principles and provisions of its Charter. I anticipate a question here: If that is your objective, then what is the meaning of your proposal? After all, the Charter of the United Nations already exists and the universal organization for peace is functioning.",UNGD
RUS,1987,"Let me remind the Assembly that the United Nations was established for a world free of nuclear weapons and that its Charter was, naturally, designed to solve the problems of such a world.",UNGD
RUS,1987,"Nuclear weapons gave rise to a different reality which, in the final analysis, made it impossible to use the United Nations fully as the principal mechanism for the maintenance of peace and security. It so happened that the nuclear tumour limited the scope of, and the possibilities for applying the Charter. Now the prospect of militarization of outer space threatens to erode its principles even further. There should however be no question of adapting the Charter to the realities of the nuclear and space age or, still less, of wrecking it. The Charter is a great document, which even today contains all the necessary provisions to enable mankind to live and solve its problems without war.",UNGD
RUS,1987,"However, even the Charter cannot do the impossible. No organization, no set of rules, no code of behaviour can save the world in the few minutes between the launching of a missile and a nuclear holocaust. If and when the implementation of the ""Star Wars"" programme begins, the ""shagreen leather"" of that time interval will shrink even further. And yet that programme has been touted here once again as a way ""to ensure a safer world"".",UNGD
RUS,1987,"This is not so. And here I will refer to a person whose statements have been quoted so readily by the President of the United States - even the day before yesterday. That person is academician Andrei Sakharov, who said:",UNGD
RUS,1987,"""My opinion as regards this programme is different from that of the Reagan Administration... it is also wrong to assert that the existence of the SDI programme has made the Soviet Union negotiate on disarmament. To the contrary, the SDI programme impedes the negotiations.""",UNGD

RUS,1987,Excluding the nuclear and space component from the security equation is the only path towards real security. We regard a comprehensive system of security as a kind of interim programme for reasserting the role of the United Nations and its Charter as the primary instruments for peace.,UNGD
RUS,1987,"What, then, are the practical aspects of a comprehensive system? Throughout the past year the sponsors of the resolution on this question have held consultations with Members of the United Nations and discussed their proposal in international forums. As a result many things have now become clearer, our ideas have become more concrete, and an atmosphere of teamwork has arisen. The system is taking precise shape in all its four aspects: politico-military, economic, environmental and humanitarian.",UNGD
RUS,1987,"In the politico-military area, it comprises the obligation of Governments not to be the first to use nuclear weapons or any force or threat of force making military doctrines exclusively defensive in nature) making public data regarding defence expenditures and calendars of exercises and manoeuvres) the adoption by all of the principle of non-offensive defence} and instituting a reliable system of verification.",UNGD
RUS,1987,We are convinced that a comprehensive system of security will also provide the key to the settlement of situations of regional conflict. That may be one of the roost difficult tasks of today.,UNGD
RUS,1987,"In this connection I shall venture to make a brief digression to address some ideas presented here the other day. I am referring to the statement made here by the President of the United States the day before yesterday. I am not going to relish engaging in polemics with him. The emotions aroused by the agreement we have reached, ray status as a guest and respect for seniority restrain  e from taking up, point by point, allegations and arguments that are groundless in the extreme. But since the President mentioned the human heart - claiming, as it were, a monopoly on having a heart while denying it to others - I should like to say the following.",UNGD
RUS,1987,"It is heartless to declare regions and continents zones of special interest for the so-called free world out of which it pumps into its own economy resources belonging to other peoples. It is heartless to recruit and arm mercenaries, to proclaim them freedom fighters, and to pay millions of dollars for the murders committed by them. It is heartless to put into the hands of bandits weapons they use to shoot down civilian aircraft. The human heart is an extremely sensitive organ, and it shudders at such treatment.",UNGD
RUS,1987,"Those who have not suffered have no compassion for anyone, we know what war on our own territory means. Therefore it is not for the sake of rhetorical effect that we declare our support for the efforts of the United Nations.",UNGD
RUS,1987,"It plays an extremely important peace-making role in Afghanistan, where the mission of the Personal Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General organically combines with the policy of national reconciliation. It is now becoming increasingly clear that the Afghans themselves are able to decide the future of their own country and indeed are doing so. This new encouraging trend is in keeping with our sincere desire to withdraw Soviet forces from Afghanistan as soon as possible, and in this we are meeting with the full understanding of the Afghan leadership.",UNGD
RUS,1987,"In Central America, the States of the region themselves have made impressive headway towards a long-awaited peace. Their success is shared by members of the Contadora Group and the Support Group and by all Latin American countries.",UNGD

RUS,1987,Real possibilities exist for the settlement of the Korean problem. The yearning of the Korean people for an easing of tension in the peninsula and the withdrawal of foreign troops and nuclear weapons cannot but evoke sympathy.,UNGD
RUS,1987,"The United Nations has a detailed plan for giving effect to the resolution on the granting of independence to the Namibian people. Its implementation would also constitute a major step towards a settlement of the situation in southern Africa. A consensus is emerging in favour of convening a conference on the Middle East problem. In Cyprus, our Organization and its Secretary-General have also been taking vigorous action and refusing to retreat in the face of obstacles.",UNGD
RUS,1987,"Here is our view of the situation in the Persian Gulf. It has become critically dangerous and might get out of control. We are not at all pleased that the development of events - which we warned was quite possible from the very outset - shows that we were right. The greater the military presence, the higher the probability of yet another conflict and the involvement in it of a State not belonging to the region. This is a source of great anxiety to us; it also strengthens our resolve to act in a sober and carefully considered manner and leads us once again to emphasize the question of removing the danger of a massive military presence.",UNGD
RUS,1987,"In the circumstances, it is extremely important to preserve the unity in the Security Council. That is not an end in itself, but a prerequisite for implementing resolution 598 (1987) . In their individual actions, each member of the Council must abide by the resolution's requirements and not violate them.",UNGD
RUS,1987,"The safety of navigation in the Gulf can and must be ensured by the entire world community, on whose behalf the United Nations will be acting. If necessary, appropriate and sufficient forces should be made effectively available to it, and the Soviet Union would agree to such a decision.",UNGD
RUS,1987,"It is necessary to secure, concurrently and immediately, a cease-fire between Iran and Iraq and to work for the fulfilment of the Secretary-General's mission with respect to an impartial body to investigate the question of responsibility for the conflict. The Security Council should receive a report within a clearly established time-frame. This would also make it possible painlessly to withdraw foreign naval and other armed forces from the Persian Gulf.",UNGD
RUS,1987,"It is very important now, in our view, to keep our composure and render every assistance to the Secretary-General and the Security Council.",UNGD
RUS,1987,"In the economic field, a comprehensive system of security seeks to promote co-operation that would be free of confrontation and would cover the entire system of co-ordinates of international economic relations. A failure to resolve issues in this area is fraught with an explosive potential which, if detonated, would spell catastrophe for mankind. The picture of prosperity painted here the day before yesterday fades in the harsh light of reality, it is hard to imagine a ""march of democracy"" in the developing countries saddled as they are with a trillion-dollar debt. It is Impossible to talk seriously of equal opportunities when a new, technological, variety of colonialism is at work.",UNGD
RUS,1987,It is imperative to act.,UNGD
RUS,1987,"We believe that the international community could reach agreement to reduce interest payments on bank credits, institute further benefits for the least developed countries, limit the annual debt-service payments of each developing country to a fixed portion of its annual export earnings, accept export products of debtor nations as payment for their debts and remove protectionist barriers to their imports, and refrain from charging additional interest for loan-payment rescheduling and debt refinancing.",UNGD
RUS,1987,"These, of course, are only suggestions for discussion, but even now consideration could be given to devising a programme of Immediate action to ease the debt burden of the developing world.",UNGD
RUS,1987,"Over the long term it is also necessary to restructure the entire international monetary system. And, of course, nothing would be more conducive to the economic development of nations than the most far-reaching programme of disarmament.",UNGD
RUS,1987,We are familiar also with a different viewpoint which does not acknowledge the relationship between disarmament and development. There are some who explain poverty by the inability of people to work and build their own lives. This is but another form of outright racism. No people is without talent or incapable of creating material and spiritual wealth. It is just a matter of different conditions that either help a people to realize its potential or thwart its efforts to do so. The elimination of economic discrimination creates favourable conditions for people to prosper economically and spiritually.,UNGD
RUS,1987,"The environmental aspect of the proposed concept reflects the evolution of thinking about the relationship between man and nature. The achievement of mankind's environmental security is as imperative as the threat of an ecological disaster facing it is real. Today we must realize that the protection of the environment must be ensured on a world-wide basis. Confrontation narrows the scope for concerted action, while co-operation can expand it. Our concept provides for a set of measures in this area.",UNGD
RUS,1987,"The human dimension is the primary yardstick for a comprehensive system of security. Nations can and must co-operate in establishing the best international conditions for safeguarding the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual everywhere, democratising internal conditions and building trust and harmony on that basis.",UNGD

RUS,1987,"We submit that for States and nations trust begins at home and that to a large extent it is based on the unity of words and deeds and in complete accord between political declarations and actual positions. Our domestic and foreign policy is and will continue to be guided by that principle, and we reserve our right to demand the same of all other Governments/ our partners. The political, social, economic and cultural rights of the individual should be safeguarded on the basis of generally accepted international instruments. That is the way it should be everywhere.",UNGD
RUS,1987,"The countries that have put forward this proposal do not claim a certificate of copyright. The system of security grows out of what has already been accomplished in the process of the peaceful coexistence of nations in the post-War years. It grows out of the activities of the United Nations, It is rooted in a broad legal foundation and the treaties which restrain the arms race. It is rooted in the negotiations on the central problems of our time and the codification of human rights standards/ in regional security-building processes and in the Non-Aligned Movement.",UNGD
RUS,1987,"As a logical result of the development of mankind's common culture in this century, that system promises to become in the future a framework for the collective application of the creative efforts of all countries and peoples. Today, when 2/000 weapons can be removed from the face of the earth/ when a historic breakthrough has been achieved in a 42-year-long trend/ such a system reflects what we believe to be a genuine, irreversible process; a product of will and perseverance. For we are indeed born to live together and we shall stand together if we become an arch in which we support each other.",UNGD
RUS,1987,"Our Assembly session provides the best occasion for reflecting on this. Its time should not be taken up with confrontation and hostility, I tell you frankly that the world is tired of that. There have been too many quotations intended to prove that you are dealing with the spawn of Hell. That is simply not serious or well founded. There have been too many accusations that detract front the dignity of nations. It is time for us to proceed to earnest dialogue; time to get down to business.",UNGD

RUS,1988,"We are meeting at a remarkable time. Though it may appear quite unremarkable on the working calendar of our Organization, it is a time filled with extraordinary events - events that can become the norm for the life of mankind if we succeed in turning them into a trend. Such, in our view, should be the main thrust of the current session, which in many respects is a watershed for the world community. I am referring to a new world calendar which is being created by the efforts of States and peoples, by the efforts of the United Nations. ",UNGD
RUS,1988,"A character in the classical comedy ""Woe from Wit"" exclaims, ""Calendars all lie"". However, the calendar that has taken shape today does not deceive us. It tells of change in the world; change that is a product of reason. We find on that calendar the Moscow summit meeting, at which Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan exchanged the instruments marking the entry into force of the Treaty on the elimination of intermediate- and shorter-range missiles; the conclusion of the Geneva Accords on political settlement around Afghanistan; the first ever public destruction of nuclear missiles; and the cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war. ",UNGD
RUS,1988,"All this is a product of reason, of a new political intellect, which has superseded the dark legacy of the past. It is destroying the reciprocal ""enemy images"" that have existed and is shaping the image of co-operative partners. ",UNGD
RUS,1988,"It has made it possible to discuss a world without arms in the emerging context of real disarmament, as was recently demonstrated at the third special session of the General Assembly on disarmament. It offers us a chance for the successful conclusion of the Vienna meeting, which is a major milestone in the process of the Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) .",UNGD
RUS,1988,"All that has occurred in the year 1988, which has witnessed many other remarkable events. This year has witnessed the four-party talks on southern Africa; the movement towards a political settlement around Kampuchea; contacts to resolve problems existing on the Korean peninsula; dialogue between the leaders of the two communities in divided Cyprus that were until recently irreconcilable; and the positive response to the initiative of the United Nations Secretary-General concerning a settlement of the problem of Western Sahara. I shall permit myself to include among the year's landmark events the Party Conference in my own country. Its main conclusion was that perestroika is irreversible. It is irreversible in both our domestic and our foreign policy. Radical change in our own house - and here I am quoting Mikhail Gorbachev - has engendered new approaches by us to international affairs too. In a sense, the calendar that I have brought to your attention is one of the consequences of that process.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"Two years ago we said here that group, bloc or ideological considerations were beginning to give way to an understanding of peace as the supreme value. Only peace, translated from the language of declarations into practical action, can give mankind a chance of survival. The Soviet Union has grasped this world-wide trend and coupled it with its own perestroika, its process of renewal.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"Today the world is changing along new lines. Through the joint efforts of States and by implementing the principles of the new political thinking, it has become possible to avert the threat of war. To a large extent this is due to the political will demonstrated by the leaders of States, and here I can only agree with President Reagan's remarks yesterday about the beneficial impact on that process of Soviet-American political dialogue.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"We are now moving further ahead - towards comprehensive security. This requires truly international co-operation. This universal international alliance must rise above differences, which, to use the words of Albert Einstein, are infinitely small compared to the danger that threatens us all.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"The formation of this alliance is being facilitated by the emergence of mechanisms of interaction among States and peoples, first and foremost through the United Nations and its institutions. Its main working unit, its engine, its heart, is here, in our house of peace, as are the people who have found way to increase the power of the instruments of peace-making, and we thank them for that. There is however, no better way of expressing gratitude than by a collective effort to enhance the role of the United Nations and make it stronger not only as a unique international forum but also as an equally unique global centre for ensuring universal and regional security and the security of each country. ",UNGD
RUS,1988,"In this capacity the United Nations should, in our view, play a more active and direct role in eliminating the main threat to mankind - the threat of a nuclear catastrophe. We would like to see greater involvement by the United Nations in the process of nuclear disarmament, in reaching a global agreement on the cessation and prohibition of nuclear-weapons testing, and in creating nuclear-free zones in various parts of the world.",UNGD
RUS,1988,Space should become an area for the priority attention of the United Nations. The international community has a vital interest in preventing it from becoming an arena for military rivalry. Today this can still be done; tomorrow will be too late.,UNGD
RUS,1988,"The Soviet Union has made the case for setting up a world space organization, which could include a centre for international co-operation in the peaceful uses of outer space, to be established on the basis of the Krasnoyarsk radar, as proposed by Mikhail Gorbachev.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"We call upon the Government of the United states to follow that example, and thus allay our concern with respect to United States radar facilities in Greenland and Great Britain. By doing that, we would not only lay the material groundwork for international co-operation in space but also strengthen the ABM Treaty regime.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"This Organization could become involved, in practical terms, in resolving the issue of conventional arms limitation.

RUS,1988,"The arms race cannot be curbed without putting under control the use of scientific and technological achievements for military purposes.

RUS,1988,"The United Nations will measure up to all these tasks if we take a fresh look at the practical aspects of our work. First of all, the General Assembly, as one of the principal bodies of the Organization, should substantially increase its contribution towards finding ways and means of solving international problems, inter alia, through renewing and improving its methods and procedures.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"There is but one criterion here - that decisions be productive and democratically worked out and adopted. A first step in this direction would he to adopt an increased proportion of United Nations decisions by consensus, though it is important that General Assembly resolutions adopted by a vote should not be devalued.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"It is also necessary to reinvigorate the work of the Security Council, and to ensure closer interaction among its members. At consultations among the five permanent members of the Council, attended by the Secretary-General, it would be useful to hold periodic reviews of situations in areas of conflict and to identify priority measures to improve the situation. It is felt that there is a need for periodic meetings of the Security Council at the foreign-minister level, as envisaged by the Charter.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"The idea of convening special expanded Security Council meetings in regions of tension is worthy of consideration. Such meetings could also be held in the capitals of the Council's permanent members. The Soviet Union confirms its readiness to host such a meeting in Moscow. We all owe a debt to the United Nations, and it is in our common interest to repay our debts. We can repay them in full if, in addition to dollar contributions, we invest innovative thought in the activity of the Organization's institutions, if we revive its main function - as a centre for the settlement of international conflicts through united efforts.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"Let there be no lament, then, over the sacred national prerogatives. The Soviet Union is a firm advocate of strengthening national sovereignty, particularly wherever infringements of it are most keenly and painfully felt. We regard as highly objectionable the anomaly of foreign military presence - military bases in other States' territories - as well as violations of national sovereignty by the undeclared arrival of nuclear arms in, or their transit through, ports of other countries. We have stated clearly what we believe: that any military presence must be confined within national borders.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"But what we are speaking of now is voluntarily delegating a portion of national rights in the interests of all - paradoxically enough, to strengthen national security, while at the same time strengthening universal security.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"The interrelationship of events in an interdependent world increasingly compels us to delegate some national prerogatives to an international organization. In fact, this is happening already. Military activity is ceasing to be taboo. Having cleared the verification barrier, and having initiated the process of real nuclear disarmament, the Soviet Union and the United States, the German Democratic Republic and Czechoslovakia, the United Kingdom, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands gave up some of their rights when they permitted the inspection of facilities in their territories. This was done in the interests of universal security. By establishing new, previously inconceivable, rules of openness in the military sphere, the world is undoubtedly moving towards the creation of a common sovereign right - the right to survive. When the United States Secretary of Defence sits at the controls of a top-secret Soviet bomber, and the Chief of the General Staff of the Soviet armed forces tours an equally secret United States base, that is something more than a mere exchange of protocol courtesies in the spirit of the times; it indicates that the elimination of secrecy is becoming a factor of security.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"We draw this conclusion from the conviction that, today, it is no longer possible to achieve political goals by means of war. To put it simply, war is ceasing to be - indeed, it has already ceased to be - an instrument of rational policy.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"Let us consider this from the perspective of regional conflicts, while they flare up and develop in different ways, they still have one feature in common - they drag on intolerably long, without delivering positive political results.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"However, positive political results are not slow in coming when interference in regional conflicts gives way to the efforts of the world community to promote their settlement. No one should hinder this process. In this context we have to speak of Afghanistan.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"The Geneva Accords are not just an isolated local instance of the settlement of a regional conflict. They ate the first step in a chain reaction leading to a healthier world. They are a new promising beginning in world politics, attesting to a qualitative change in political thinking. They are a message of good news to other regions. Any violation of the Geneva Accords undermines those achievements.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"The Soviet Union and the Republic of Afghanistan are observing their obligations under those Accords faithfully, to the letter. There is no need to prove that. However attempts are being made arbitrarily to alter the formula established by the Geneva Accords, thus significantly changing its meaning.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"As soon as the Soviet troops began to withdraw, a non-stop production line of violations was set in motion. The list of them would totally refute the assertion heard here yesterday that bloodshed has diminished in that region. On the contrary, terror has been mounting sharply and is increasingly directed against civilians.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"In the circumstances, the fact is that faithful compliance by some with their obligations creates conditions for others to commit new crimes, of which the most heinous is the destruction of hard-won hopes. This must not be allowed to happen. The chain of conflict settlement generated by Afghanistan must not be allowed to break.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"We are not complaining to anyone. We have the means to make things fall into place. But we are responsible to the United Nations, and therefore we are appealing to it. We are proposing that a meeting of the permanent members of the Security Council, hosted by the United Nations Secretary-General, discuss the question of compliance with the Geneva Accords. It would also be appropriate to invite to such a meeting representatives of the parties directly concerned. ",UNGD
RUS,1988,The deep involvement of the United Nations in the resolution of major international problems has spotlighted the acute need for new mechanisms of verification and control. We propose that consideration be given to the idea of an international monitoring and verification agency within the framework of the United Nations.,UNGD
RUS,1988,That body's terms of reference could be very broad. Disarmament and security in all its aspects are becoming an increasingly multilateral and truly international process. The institution for monitoring and verification should also be international.,UNGD
RUS,1988,Many countries feel the need for it. Thus Japan is proposing an interesting idea for the world-wide seismic monitoring of nuclear explosions. France has what we regard as the reasonable idea of setting up an international satellite monitoring system.,UNGD
RUS,1988,"These are interesting ideas, but how could they be implemented? Naturally, the most sensible way is to make their, part of a universal monitoring and verification mechanism that would operate under United Nations auspices or within its structure.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"Verification is no longer a preference but an imperative of our time. It is an imperative of our time to search for forms and methods for the development of societies that would be in keeping with modern requirements. Certainly this is true with respect to socialism, but with equal certainty it applies to other socio-political systems. While we are changing in both our own and international interests, we are entitled to expect the same kind of perestroika from others.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"Separating the wheat from the chaff, distinguishing the right choice from the wrong, and achievements from deterioration, we are unforgiving in judging the past. To be self-critical is the canonical rule for politicians who believe in their people and want the people to believe them. But we expect certain leaders of States who address the international community to be equally self-critical in assessing the past.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"It is appropriate to mention this in the year that marks the anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which some are marking by reasserting the supremacy of law, and others by preaching their own faultlessness. We could list numerous international instruments on human rights that have not been ratified by the countries represented here by some speakers. We could talk of the continuous practice of violations of civil rights in those countries. But we prefer to speak of ourselves.",UNGD
RUS,1988,The supremacy of law is the corner-stone of political renewal in our country. Creating a State based on the rule of law also has a direct bearing on our foreign policy.,UNGD
RUS,1988,"A constitutionally authorized mechanism for working out and adopting strategic foreign-policy decisions is being put in place in our country. Questions such as military budgets, the use of troops outside the country, and innovations in the development of the armed forces will also be subject to constitutional and legal scrutiny.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"For us, the principle of the supremacy of law and the policy of democratising our society ace indivisible. The emergence of a State based on the rule of law links with the world-wide will to assert the primacy of international law as the standard for mankind's existence. Among politico-military, economic, humanitarian and environmental guarantees of universal security, we view its legal guarantees as paramount.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"From States based on the rule of law to a world based on the rule of law - such is the logic of the movement. A starting-point on this path could be the elaboration of a major long-term programme for the development of international law. Its thrust could be expressed in the motto ""Security, trust and co-operation through law"". ",UNGD
RUS,1988,We must also work persistently to enhance the effectiveness of the International Court of Justice on the basis of developing a common approach by all States to that main judicial body of the United Nations. Completion of the preparation of a code of crimes against peace and the security of mankind would be a major step.,UNGD
RUS,1988,"Probably nowhere is the role of law so important as in ensuring freedom of choice, which is the linchpin of the new political thinking. For how can there be any freedom to choose one's own course in situations in which international law is constantly violated - as in southern Africa, the Middle East, Central America and elsewhere?",UNGD
RUS,1988,"Freedom of choice defies confinement within ideological borders or geographical zones. It cannot be stopped by ""crusades""; it can only be recognized. It is absolute, and equally -resolute is our respect for it, regardless of the orientation of any particular country.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"By defining freedom of choice as the key link in the new political thinking, we hope to use that key to open many doors that until now have been tightly locked. Recognition of the diversity of interests, the priority of universal human values and the supremacy of political means in solving international problems, and replacing confrontation with dialogue - those and other components of the new political thinking have resulted in substantial and, we trust, irreversible positive changes. Yet, the fires of political inquisition ace still blazing in the world, and some would try to bring to the stake entire nations and movements accused of the heresy of having freely chosen their own course. Ideology in the shape of missile projectiles crushes them with the cruelty of a medieval axe. I should like to stress that our sympathy is on the side of those who seek to achieve freedom of choice.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"Why, for instance, can the great American people have their own great dream, and why should the Cuban or the Nicaraguan, the Angolan or the Vietnamese people, the Ethiopian people be deprived of the right to have their own ideals? Why cannot the Palestinian people have their homeland? Why should other nations, countries and movements be humiliated by great Power arrogance? While not renouncing any of our values or denying to others the right to have their own, while continuing to respect the yearning of peoples for national self-assertion and liberation from economic subjugation and political dependence, the Soviet Union supports the de-ideologization of international relations and the exclusion of the overwhelming component of ideological differences from foreign policy and diplomacy. It expects and hopes that others will do likewise.",UNGD
RUS,1988,It expects the problem of how to pool our efforts to be recognized as commensurate with the problem of the survival of mankind. It expects the force of peace-making policy to prevail over the policy of force which has run its historical course.,UNGD
RUS,1988,"The division of mankind into great and small countries is something which has also run its historical course. And, if the term ""great Powers"" is to be kept at all, it is only in the sense of great responsibility towards the rest of the world. Divisions and re-divisions of the world into spheres of influence are historically pointless. Today, we must all have only one sphere of influence – our planet. It will perish if our influence on the threatening course of destructive developments is divided and fragmented into blocs and systems. Therefore, the Soviet leadership has attempted to reinterpret more profoundly the idea, originally inherent in Marxism, of the interrelationship between class and universal human values, according priority to the interests shared by all nations. In our vision of peaceful coexistence as the universal principle of international relations, it does not emerge as a special form of class struggle.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"A rigid polarization of the world, which is becoming increasingly diverse, must give way to its consolidation, which allows the rivalry of two different systems to take on non-confrontational forms. This, if you will, is also a choice, the freedom of which is born of the new political thinking and of its dialectics- which makes it possible to put policies to the test of real life.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"But it would appear that not everyone measures up to this freedom. Obstinately clinging to divisive fetishes, some would try to put a brake on the action of the centrifugal forces. As a result, any red-letter days have not appeared on the new calendar of peace this year. For example, it does not include the date marking the completion of a treaty on 50 per cent reductions in strategic arms. The pace of real disarmament set by the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles is slowing down as negotiations proceed.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"We seemed to have dealt once and for all with the issue of verification, but it has arisen again because of the negative position of our negotiating partners. It looks as if the Russian proverb ""Trust but verify"" is good only when applied to the Soviet Union but is not applicable to the United States.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"Once again we call on the United States of America to reconsider its attitude to verification of the process of reducing and eliminating nuclear arsenals. For verification is something more than the technical checking on the parties compliance with their obligations. It is the material expression of sincerity and honesty, without which it is impossible to make policy today. It is also regrettable that an agreement barring weapons from outer space has not been concluded in 1988.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"We had every reason to hope that 1988 would see the signing of a history-making global convention on the complete prohibition and destruction of chemical weapons. Indeed, most of the complex fundamental issues have either been settled already or ace close to agreement. But once again, the sticky quagmire of procrastination is thwarting the final step towards victory. Meanwhile, in the absence of progress an alarming trend towards the spread of chemical weapons and what I would call chemical permissiveness is surreptitiously beginning to develop.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"We do not object to the exploration of alternative ways. The Soviet Union takes a positive view of the proposal made yesterday by the President of the United States to convene a conference of the parties to the 1925 Geneva Protocol. At the same time we, of course, assume that the drafting of the convention banning chemical weapons will be continued and, of course, completed.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"The beginning of the process of nuclear disarmament has brought into sharper focus the problem of conventional armed forces and armaments, including naval armaments. Here, too, great hopes were being pinned on this year. The programme of radical reductions in the military capabilities of the two opposing political-military alliances proposed by Warsaw Treaty countries has put the problem on the track of practical solution.",UNGD
RUS,1988,We have a clear goal - to achieve a situation in which the two sides would . have only the forces and capabilities sufficient for defence but insufficient for launching a surprise attack or conducting offensive operations. ,UNGD
RUS,1988,"There is also another priority problem. Access to conventional weapons in their most modern modifications is expanding. Their technological sophistication makes it easier to use them. There is now no need to spend much time or money on special training, and anyone can easily operate those infernal devices. In other words, conventional weapons are becoming part of everyday life, a common tool in the hands of too many people. This dangerous situation, which is particularly typical of regional conflicts, calls for joint efforts to constrain international arms markets.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"Working out a mandate for the future negotiations is also a collective undertaking. Jointly with our allies, we have been finding solutions which bring general agreement closer.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"On the question of unfulfilled hopes, we must mention the lack of progress in settling some of the most pressing problems, such as those of the Middle East, Central America, and certain others.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"Today, it is clearer than ever what needs to be done. Elementary common sense enjoins that consolidation of forces must be placed above their fragmentation, and constructive dialogue must be placed above destructive scepticism. None of us can any longer waste our time on mutual fault-finding, on mutual recrimination and reproaches. The growing physical destruction of our planet is the verdict against the existing division of the world. It is because of that division that so many pages in the 1988 calendar have not been filled. It is foe the same reason that this year has had such a generous supply of sombre dates.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"It is perhaps for the first time that we have seen the stark reality of the threat to our environment - a second front fast approaching and acquiring urgency equal to that of the nuclear and space threat. For the first time we have seen clearly that, in the absence of any global control, man's so-called peaceful constructive activity is turning into global aggression against the very foundations of life on earth. For the first time we have understood clearly what we had guessed: that the traditional view of national and universal security, based primarily on military means of defence, is now totally obsolete and must be urgently revised.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"Faced with the threat of environmental catastrophe, the dividing lines of the bipolar ideological world are receding. The biosphere recognizes no division into blocs, alliances or systems. All share the same climatic system and no one is in a position to build his own isolated and independent line of environmental defence.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"Man-made ""second nature"" - the technosphere - has turned out to be dangerously fragile. The consequences of many of its breakdowns are becoming international and global.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"The environmental crisis is being exported on an increasing scale, with toxic technologies, facilities, products and wastes spreading, overtly or covertly, through the channels of economic relations.",UNGD
RUS,1988,Quite deliberate attempts are being made to turn densely populated areas of the third world into toxic waste dumps.,UNGD
RUS,1988,"In a situation like this it is suicidal to try economically to rein in progressive national developments, to wear down an imaginary enemy by economic pressure. That is the kind of thinking that belongs to the Stone Age.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"It is unreasonable to impede the economic reconstruction of countries that seek to restructure the energy industries and to introduce resource-saving and waste-free technologies, thus making the world less dangerous.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"How much more sensible it is, as we ate proposing to the United States and other countries, to abolish some planned or ongoing military programmes and channel the funds thus released towards instituting an international regime of environmental security.",UNGD
RUS,1988,All the environmental disasters of this year have placed in the forefront the task of pooling and co-ordinating efforts to develop a global strategy for a rational management of the environment.,UNGD
RUS,1988,"All of us - and I emphasize this, all of us - need an international programme to manage the risks involved in economic activities and to shift to alternative technologies that spare both man and nature.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"We need resources to save our planet, instead of destroying it. I believe that the world community possesses such resources. But they have to be supplemented, first, by the will and readiness to act and, secondly, by an effective mechanism for international ecological co-operation.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"It is quite clear that in this area, too, nothing can be done without the tools of the new political thinking. In this area, too, it must emphasize the factor of time. We have too little of it - very little - and problems are piling up faster than they can be solved.",UNGD
RUS,1988,Even the implementation of the positive decisions already adopted could take years and years. Just the physical elimination of intermediate- and shorter-range missiles will take three years of continuous daily work and the Treaty's entire sequence of implementation will take 13 years. This makes it incumbent upon us to take responsible decisions today.,UNGD
RUS,1988,What are our liabilities? Tens of thousands of nuclear warheads and hundreds of thousands of tons of toxic agents; mountains of conventional armaments; holes burnt in the ozone layer and the eroding biosphere; the greenhouse effect and the depletion of non-renewable sources of energy; acid rains and deserts devouring the green world; forest fires-and floods; drying up seas and dying fauna; terrorism against the peoples and aggression against nature.,UNGD
RUS,1988,"What are cur assets? The world's growing maturity which makes it possible to raise and solve global problems on a planetary scale; a growing world-wide ""Green Peace"" movement; shared perceptions of environmental scientists and policy-makers who are becoming increasingly active as environmentalists, as demonstrated by the document of the States Parties to the Warsaw Treaty and the recent appeal issued by the peace movement; the report entitled ""Our Common Future"", prepared by the World Commission headed by Mrs. Brundtland, and the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) models of environmental renascence to counter environmental apocalypse; the experience of the past three years which attests to the possibility of removing corrosive growths from the body of the earth; the experience of pooling the efforts of States in the use of advanced technology, such as thermonuclear fusion and superconductivity, in the interests of human survival.",UNGD
RUS,1988,This year's calendar has also included another event; the inauguration of the Centre for the development of an international experimental thermonuclear reactor by scientists from very many countries who will chart the way towards inexhaustible sources of energy for the coming century and at the same time develop a model for concerting efforts in the interests of all peoples. ,UNGD
RUS,1988,Among our assets is the realization that a monopoly of a small number of countries over advanced technologies and attempts at all costs to keep others on the sidelines of the emerging science-and-information world may boomerang against the monopolists.,UNGD
RUS,1988,"Among our assets is the United Nations, whose high efficiency has been so graphically demonstrated by the events of 1988. They have also highlighted a simple but very profound truth; when nations, particularly the great Powers, begin to co-operate, the United Nations gains in influence and strength, once again recapturing the spirit of its initial objectives.",UNGD
RUS,1988,It is true that the fable about two elephants stamping our grass is still popular. President Reagan's statement yesterday would seem to indicate that this grass is not being threatened.,UNGD
RUS,1988,"We do not want to fight, and love is still a remote possibility.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"But speaking seriously, the world community has gained much from the improvement in Soviet-American relations.",UNGD
RUS,1988,In this regard I am pleased to cite a remark by Mr. Perez de Cuellar.,UNGD
RUS,1988,"The meeting between Gorbachev and Reagan, he said, has shown the world community an example of voluntary dialogue. Governments have suddenly realized that the United Nations is an entirely appropriate place for negotiations and solving problems. Precisely, but I would say ""the most appropriate place"". If in the past it has not always been that, the Organization itself is least to blame.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"Let us speak frankly and say that many of us, including particularly the permanent members of the Security Council, are to blame for the fact that at some point certain fundamental values of our Organization embodied in its Charter were devalued. Now that they are regaining their initial level, it is our duty to learn the bitter lessons of the past for the sake of the future.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"Today, for instance, the Soviet Union is reconsidering its previous attitude to the Organization's economic institutions. In particular, we attach great importance to the activities of the United Nations Economic and Social Council and would like to contribute to enhancing its effectiveness.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"No country stands to gain by remaining aloof from the international forums of our Organization. Having drawn this more than obvious conclusion, we are asking: should not some of our partners take a fresh look at their attitude to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)?",UNGD
RUS,1988,"The permanent members of the Security Council should set an example in strengthening the authority of the united Nations, enhancing its role and expanding and enriching its peace-making functions. All of us here are witnesses to the beginning of the renaissance of our Organization. At the same time we are architects of this process. We shall enhance the role of the United Nations even more by concerted efforts to combat the threats to our environment. It is, we believe, precisely within the framework of the United Nations that international machinery should be established to formulate urgent decisions on pressing global problems, above all economic and environmental problems. ",UNGD
RUS,1988,"The Soviet Union proposes a discussion on the question of how to turn the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) into an environmental council capable of taking effective decisions to ensure ecological security. It proposes that a three-event series of emergency meetings be held - of course, under the auspices of the United nations - to co-ordinate efforts in the field of ecological security; a consultative meeting of experts to discuss the health of the Earth, in 1989? a summit meeting of the leaders of, say, 15 or 20 States representing all continents, and the influential force of our time, the Non-Aligned Movement, in 1992 the holding of the second United Nations international conference on the environment, as planned, in 1992, or even earlier, but in any event at summit level.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"We have been speaking of a calendar of real achievements, a calendar of ideas as yet unrealised, a calendar of hopes and plans for the future. The review of this year that we have undertaken is not an end in itself. What can be an end in itself is the inner moral objective of achieving progress and acceptance of the political need to identify the moment of truth, which from time immemorial has tended towards movement, towards overcoming inaction.",UNGD
RUS,1988,This year has been full of both movement and slow-downs. It has shown that Mikhail Gorbachev was right when he said;,UNGD
RUS,1988,"""A complex and in many respects unusual situation is developing in the world. We are at the beginning of a new, long road that offers new prospects and new problems"" Which tendency will prevail? What will gain the upper hand - the tendency towards further movement ahead or the inertia of stagnation?",UNGD
RUS,1988,"The answer is to be found in abandoning certain dogmas, even though cast in the form of eternal truths. We have to write a new catechism of international existence, in which the beginning will be thought and reason, followed by deeds for the sake of our common salvation and development. We must stop sermonizing from lofty international rostrums and recognize the principle of equality in international dialogue.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"As for the dogma of ""peace through strength"", let us leave it to those who worship the faded commandments of the past. The keynote of history is peace through reason, and this, too, is a commandment foe the future.",UNGD
RUS,1988,"The past has great power over us, but although that is true, the future has an even greater gravitational pull. The poetic metaphor, ""to win the affection of space, to heed the call of the future"", takes on a lofty political meaning.",UNGD

RUS,1988,Let us begin now.,UNGD
RUS,1989,"My task as head of the delegation of the Soviet Union to the General Assembly has been greatly facilitated by two fundamental statements made by Mikhail S.

RUS,1989,"The profound analytical report of Mr. Perez de Cuellar on the work of our Organization over the past year has impressed us with its convincing evidence of the expansion of the role of the United Nations as a global peace-maker. Addressing the Assembly, its new President, the representative of Nigeria, Mr. Garba, also referred to that.",UNGD

RUS,1989,"sure, wants it to become a part of an organic and unitary whole. Unfortunately, in some places the overall composition is still marred by cracks that impair its integrity. Over the past 12 months we have seen a rather contradictory picture of the state of the world.",UNGD
RUS,1989,"Of course, the central concept remains the same and the theme, a product of mankind's thought and suffering, as we were appropriately reminded by the fiftieth anniversary of the outbreak of the Second World War, has not changed: it is the piloting of our common ark towards a new shore and our common desire to chart its course so as to avoid a storm that might destroy it. Nevertheless, there have been some new developments which have aroused concern. It is not just that the ship of the world has not yet negotiated the dangerous straits; it is encountering new threats that could give it a critical lurch.",UNGD
RUS,1989,"The twentieth century has released the tremendous energy of nations and peoples, and this has become a major factor in the development of universal civilization. It is capable of and has been working miracles by extricating entire national communities from backwardness and poverty in what is historically an amazingly brief span of time. It is adding to the mosaic of the world more and",UNGD
RUS,1989,"more bright and clear-cut elements of progress and prosperity. However, the same national energy, when it takes the form of inflated egotism and self-interest, often makes for aggression and expansion, a grasping for one's own good at the expense of others.",UNGD
RUS,1989,"Here the problem of the self-defence of nations arises, the problem of their Physical survival, preserving their unique historical and cultural identities. Action provokes counteraction, which assumes some highly ambivalent forms. Centrifugal tendencies are prevailing over centripetal ones, thus upsetting the balance of world relationships, which is so hard to build.",UNGD
RUS,1989,"This diverts the focus of our attention from traditional international issues to domestic and inter-ethnic conflicts. It has now become quite clear that internal strife in some countries extends the process of their destabilization to vast areas and that regional upheavals convulse the whole world. Lebanon is a case in point. It is often much easier to resolve the external issues in a settlement than to deal with its internal conditions, and this is clearly evident in Afghanistan and Cambodia.",UNGD
RUS,1989,"Today the notion of ""inside the country"" often has a bearing on that of ""outside"". The trouble, however, is that the isolated fragments of the world which yearn for a better life fail to see beyond the mountain ridges, jungles, dunes and other features of their own national landscapes, the threat to their own existence, that might objectively result from such a fragmented view. Equally, those who want to prosper at the expense of others do not see that their own existence is also threatened.",UNGD
RUS,1989,This leads us to the question of the responsibility of the part vis-à-vis the whole and of nations vis-à-vis mankind. This places on our agenda the problem of harmonizing universal and national interests.,UNGD
RUS,1989,Some clarifications and explanations are in order here.,UNGD
RUS,1989,"The supremacy of universal human values and observance of universal rules of the world community are the imperatives of our time. The objective requirements of the age we live in, its trends, character and circumstances leave mankind no other choice but to reject the traditional polarization. This is the axiom which underlies both the concept and the practical policies of the new thinking. Of course, it cannot resolve the existing contradictions overnight, but as a start it can alleviate them.",UNGD
RUS,1989,"On the question of the primacy of universal human values, we are also implying the mature readiness of nations to accept this. Where that maturity has not yet been attained, and where the national idea is being juxtaposed with the common interest, domestic conflicts directly complement and impel global destructive processes.",UNGD
RUS,1989,"Now I should like to stress this: freedom of choice continues to crown the hierarchy of a nation's supreme values. Every nation is free to choose the ways and means of its own development, but to do so in a responsible manner. It must not lock itself in the dark rooms of national selfishness or ignore the interests of other peoples and of the entire community of nations. Freedom does not mean irresponsibility towards others, for in the final analysis that would mean irresponsibility towards oneself.",UNGD

I will permit myself to touch upon the  United States-Soviet dialogue only because I am convinced that its importance far transcends the frontiers of the two States.

We have proposed to the United States side options for resolving the key issues in that agreed: the Treaty on the Limitation of Anti-ballistic Missile Systems, space, and long-range sea-launched cruise missiles. Our partners have accommodated us on mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles. Positions on other outstanding problems have come closer to each other. In our view, by the time the summit meeting is held next year, in late spring or early summer, we may have passed the last turn on the road towards a treaty reducing strategic offensive arms. This is a real prospect. The protocols to the 1974 and 1976 Treaties on nuclear explosions could also be signed at the summit meeting so that they could enter into force very soon thereafter. We are confident that the summit meeting will give a powerful impetus to the talks on major reductions in the armed forces and conventional armaments in Europe.",UNGD
RUS,1989,"We welcome the proposal concerning chemical weapons put forward yesterday by President Bush. Generally consistent with the initiatives of the Soviet leadership, it indicates to us that we share the desire to rid mankind of these barbaric weapons. The Soviet Union is ready, together with the United States, to go further and assume mutual obligations prior to the conclusion of a multilateral convention: cease the production of chemical weapons, as we have already done - I am referring here also to binary weapons, on a bilateral basis, radically reduce or completely destroy Soviet and United States chemical weapons, regarding this as a step towards the global destruction of chemical weapons: renounce the use of chemical weapons under any circumstances, institute rigorous verification of the cessation of the production and the elimination of chemical warfare agents. I think there is no need to say how beneficial all this would be for the overall world climate.",UNGD
RUS,1989,"In addition to the problems of security, the Soviet-United States agenda encompasses issues of humanitarian cooperation, regional topics and joint efforts in the fields of the environment and economic development, reflecting the process that brings together national and universal concerns. We are more aware today than ever before that Soviet-United States relations cannot be built outside the global context, divorced from the problems concern to all mankind.",UNGD
RUS,1989,"Our discussions in Washington and Wyoming have moved us ahead in our efforts to bridge the continuing gap between the attitudes to one's own good and the attitudes to the common good. Much remains to be done, however, to alleviate the disparities of political objectives, for such disparities endanger all of us.",UNGD
RUS,1989,"Let us examine the situation, taking nuclear weapons as an example. Why are they dangerous? Not only because of their sheer destructive power. They are unacceptable because they widen the chasm between national and universal interests. The equality of nations and the unity of the world become empty talk when someone's national selfishness is driven by the idea of nuclear supremacy over the world, camouflaged as national security interests.",UNGD
RUS,1989,I would say that the world community has as yet no reason for complacency or euphoria. The nuclear threat has only been reduced by the Soviet-United States Treaty eliminating intermediate and shorter-range missiles.,UNGD
RUS,1989,We believe that reliance on nuclear weapons does not serve anyone's national interests. It is also an obstacle in the way of more democratic international relations. Only the complete elimination of nuclear capabilities would help to attain real security.,UNGD
RUS,1989,,UNGD
RUS,1989,"The advocates of nuclear deterrence do not believe this will be possible in the foreseeable future. They respond with concepts of so-called minimum nuclear deterrence. In our view, that is a step forward, if only a timid one, a step that can be taken. But first we must define what we mean by minimum nuclear deterrence and what capabilities should be considered sufficient.",UNGD
RUS,1989,"The Soviet Union proposes that those questions be discussed at a meeting of representatives of the nuclear Powers and the States on whose territories nuclear weapons are placed. Of course, the persistence of the concepts of nuclear deterrence is due not only to the undue emphasis placed on national rights and interests at the expense of obligations, but also to the lack of trust. The problem should not be easily dismissed. What is the way out of these vicious circles? It lies in affirming glasnost and openness and in building a wide-ranging infrastructure of pervasive verification. If we do need to deter each other, let deterrence be transparent and verifiable.",UNGD
RUS,1989,"To that end, the Soviet Union is proposing that all nuclear Powers conclude multilateral agreements on measures to reduce the risk of the outbreak of nuclear war. Detailed discussions to work out such an agreement could be held in consultations among the permanent members of the Security Council.",UNGD
RUS,1989,"In the same context, we wish to raise once again the problem of the cessation and prohibition of nuclear tests. This is the question of questions. Why are we still unable to put an end to such tests despite the express will of the overwhelming majority of nations? Because there are those who want to maintain their superiority at any cost.",UNGD
RUS,1989,"Guided by its obligations to the world community, the Soviet Union has revised its nuclear-testing programme by reducing the number and yield of explosions.",UNGD
RUS,1989,"Let me point out, however, that the efforts of one State are not sufficient for a comprehensive solution to this problem. We see a number of possibilities here. First of all, the USSR is ready to reinstate its moratorium on all nuclear explosions on any day and at any hour if the United States reciprocates. Secondly, it is time finally to end the procedural impasse at the Conference on Disarmament and start concrete discussions there on the problem of a complete test ban. Thirdly, as one possible way of achieving such a ban, we are now considering the possibility of extending the 1963 Treaty to cover underground nuclear explosions. There is an urgent need for a verifiable cessation of the production of fissionable material for weapons purposes. We have declared that this year we are ceasing the production of enriched uranium, that in 1987 we closed down one reactor producing weapons-grade plutonium, and that we plan to close down in 1989 and 1990 a few more such reactors. By the year 2000 all remaining reactors will have been shut down.",UNGD
RUS,1989,"In addition, the Soviet Union is proposing that all nuclear Powers should begin preparing to conclude an agreement on the cessation and prohibition of the Production of such material. We believe that in the verification of compliance with the agreement the vast experience of applying International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards could prove useful.",UNGD
RUS,1989,"It would seem that even the way the Second World War began ought to have made clear that weapons do not guarantee security - the more weapons there are, the greater the danger of aggression. And yet for the 45 post-war years security has been sought in the arms race. It is only today that we are beginning to understand the need for a fundamentally different concept of security in Europe, a security that relies increasingly on political means and, only as insurance, on the necessary minimum of armaments.",UNGD
RUS,1989,"The Vienna accord heralded a new European situation, opening up broad vistas for humanitarian cooperation and exchanges of people, ideas and information. It holds out the prospect that the European idea will rest itself on a foundation of trust and openness. But the groundwork has to be prepared for that by clearing the continent of excessive quantities of arms. That work has begun.",UNGD
RUS,1989,"When the negotiators do not consign their responsibilities to the back rooms, when they sincerely want to strike a balance between their interests and those of their partners, progress is always achieved. One example is the Vienna talks between the Warsaw Treaty countries and the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on reducing armed forces and conventional armaments in Europe.",UNGD
RUS,1989,"In response to our alliance's initiative the NATO countries have made some meaningful proposals, which go a long way towards accommodating the positions of the Warsaw Treaty countries. In parallel talks between the countries participating in the European process to develop a qualitatively new generation of confidence- and security-building measures the Warsaw Treaty member countries have proposed a far-reaching approach calling for a comprehensive set of such measures, and extending them to air force and naval activities.",UNGD
RUS,1989,"Reverting to the topic of the obligations of individual countries to the community, I feel it my duty to emphasize that reluctance to engage in active talks on reducing naval forces is a sign of neglect of those obligations. Leaving naval forces outside the process of reducing armed forces and armaments would be harmful to universal security. The problem of naval forces could be examined, for example, in special consultations to be attended by all States concerned and, above all, by major naval Powers. They would discuss mutual concerns in this sphere and would exchange views on the mechanism and ultimate objective of future negotiations and on how to move towards them step by step.",UNGD
RUS,1989,"The dialectic of developments on the European continent urgently requires the starting of talks on tactical nuclear weapons. The situation does not appear to be deadlocked. Mutually acceptable solutions could be sought in an in-depth discussion of this whole range of issues between the USSR, the United States, the United Kingdom, France and the States where those weapons have been placed. If NATO countries agree to start talks on tactical nuclear weapons the USSR will respond with further unilateral cuts in its tactical nuclear missiles in Europe.",UNGD
RUS,1989,"The problem of missile proliferation is also ripe for multilateral discussions. Nearly 20 countries possess such weapons, and the trend towards further geographical spread is still strong.",UNGD
RUS,1989,"The approach to this issue could be two-pronged. Barriers could be erected which, first, would preclude the proliferation of combat missiles and associated technology across the globe, and, secondly, would not impinge on the legitimate interest of countries in gaining peaceful access to outer space.",UNGD
RUS,1989,"No one in the world can yet bid farewell to arms, but we can abandon, once and for all - and we can do it now - the practice of unconstrained and uncontrolled international weapons transfers, lb that end the principles of glasnost and openness should be asserted here as well. The USSR reaffirms its willingness to participate in the establishment of a United Nations register of weapons sales and transfers, including work on parameters.",UNGD
RUS,1989,"The time has come when the idea of preventing war is finding material expression in relations between the armed forces of a number of countries. A new peace-making instrument is being shaped by the Soviet-United States agreement on preventing dangerous military activities and by a series of agreements with the United States, the United Kingdom, West Germany and France on the prevention of incidents on the high seas. Along the same lines. Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China have agreed to start talks short!, on putting an end to their military standoff. The  Soviet union expresses the hope that other states too will engage in this process.",UNGD
RUS,1989,"A civilised world is an open world. Breaking the seals on many secrets, the soviet union has revealed to the international community detailed data about all reductions in its armed forces and armaments, their strength, the size of its military budget, and so on.",UNGD
RUS,1989,"We reaffirm here the position of the Soviet Union. Our ultimate goal is to have not a single Soviet soldier outside the country. But, speaking of equal responsibilities, let us roundly condemn the continuing encirclement of our country - and not only our country - by military bases of other states.",UNGD
RUS,1989,"The soviet union attaches fundamental importance to a transition from individual measures of confidence-building, openness and glasnost in international affairs to a global policy of openness, which would become an integral part of comprehensive security and international peace. The President of the united States, Mr. Bush, has proposed the idea of open skies. We like that idea. In welcoming and supporting the initiative, the Soviet Union calls for the opening up and open space, only then shall  e attain absolute transparency and the necessary level of confidence.",UNGD
RUS,1989,"While we duly include in the records of foreign policy such accomplishments as the Geneva Agreements on Afghanistan, the process of granting independence to Namibia, the termination of hostilities on the Iran-Iraq front, and the constructive dynamics in the dialogue on the problem of Cambodia, we cannot yet say that the positive trends are irreversible.",UNGD
RUS,1989,"Let us pay a grateful tribute to this Organization for its peace-keeping operations. Let us recognize its unique role, which goes beyond simply localizing conflicts and achieves a qualitatively new level in ensuring stability in the world order. But today's world order is of a far broader category. We have firmly established economic security as one of its pillars.",UNGD
RUS,1989,"The Soviet Union shares the entirely justified concern about, and it supports, measures to overcome the crisis in the world economy - measures that were proposed at the Belgrade summit meeting of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. There are a few who continue to dictate to the many the terms of their economic existence. The devotees of diktat should understand that perpetuation of the current situation is fraught with the danger of a catastrophe that would spare no one - and that is no exaggeration.",UNGD
RUS,1989,"It would seem that the world of the rich has nothing to worry about since its economy is in good shape. It would seem also that the rich are beyond reproach since, ostensibly, their wealth breeds generosity. In 1988 the aggregate amount of the developed nations' assistance to the developing countries amounted to 3US 90 billion - an impressive sum indeed - but in the same year the developed nations received from the developed world $US 50 billion more in debt servicing and interest payments. That was the largest flow of capital in history from the poor to the rich man's pocket.",UNGD

Now that there is a prospect of limiting the military-industrial complexes, the problem of conversion has to be addressed. This can be done only by working together and relying on the experience of all States.",UNGD

But if it is mandatory for us in our attitude towards the current Government of Poland, why are others so intolerant as regards, say, Cuba?

After all, what can be sufficient in the face of the irrational? On the other hand, this aggression has once again underscored the validity of the argument that no country should have the exclusive prerogative or absolute freedom to determine its own level of armament. Any other approach would result in an unbridled arms race and all-out militarisation; we must look towards different principles, towards accommodation to the concerns of others and towards a balance of armaments at the lowest possible levels.",UNGD
RUS,1990,"We in the Soviet Union have the unfortunate experience of having built up an excessive military capability, and we know very well what that costs. This was due more to an erroneous assessment of the situation and a desire to protect the country against any eventuality than to any evil intent or aggressiveness.

Of course, parity is needed for global stability, but it should not go beyond the limits of reasonable defence needs.",UNGD

RUS,1990,"We need to agree on principles governing the sale and supply of arms. Such attempts were made in the past, but unfortunately they were not carried through to their logical conclusion.",UNGD
RUS,1990,"In our view, the Geneva Conference on Disarmament must be urgently requested to address this issue and to submit recommendations to the General Assembly at its next session.",UNGD
RUS,1990,"Two years ago the Soviet delegation raised the issue of reactivating the work of the Security Council's Military Staff Committee, Recent developments convince us of the need to return to the original idea conceived by the creators of this Organisation and of its Charter.",UNGD
RUS,1990,"We know why the Military Staff Committee has never become a functioning body. During the ""cold war"" the Committee did not and could not have a role to play. How, however, we see that without substantive recommendations from that body the Security Council is unable to carry out its functions under the Charter. ",UNGD
RUS,1990,"The architects of our Organisation proceeded from the harsh realities of the Second World War and were right in assuming that if the Organisation was to be effective in keeping the peace and preventing war, it must have the means to enforce its decisions and, if necessary, to suppress aggression and must also have machinery for the preparation and co-ordination of such actions.",UNGD
RUS,1990,The Soviet delegation believes that the Security Council must take the necessary organisational steps to be able to act in strict conformity with the provisions of the Charter.,UNGD
RUS,1990,It should begin by initiating steps to reactivate the work of the Military Staff Committee and to study the practical aspects of assigning national military contingents to serve under the authority of the Council.,UNGD
RUS,1990,The Soviet Union is prepared to conclude an appropriate agreement with the Security Council. We are sure that the other permanent members of the Council and States that might be approached by it will do the same.,UNGD
RUS,1990,"If the Military Staff Committee had worked properly, if appropriate agreements had been concluded between the Council and its permanent members and if other organizational aspects of countering threats to peace had been worked out, there would now be no need for individual States to act unilaterally. After all, however justified they might be, such actions provoke a mixed response, create problems for those States themselves and may not be acceptable to all.",UNGD
RUS,1990,"By contrast, there is no reason to object to actions taken by the legitimate international ""law-enforcement bodies"" - the Security Council and the Military Staff Committee.",UNGD
RUS,1990,We also should not underestimate even the psychological effect of the Security Council's acquiring structures and forces to counter aggression.,UNGD
RUS,1990,"I should like to emphasize that the use of force is possible only as a last resort. We must rely on non-military, political means and pursue our objectives in a peaceful manner. Today ,ore than ever before, it is these methods that are becoming effective.",UNGD
RUS,1990,The latest crisis has dramatically illustrated the importance of preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction.,UNGD
RUS,1990,"To be frank, the situation is becoming most alarming. Let us face its cracks have appeared in the nuclear non-proliferation regime; difficulties are being encountered in expanding the zone of application of the safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). It is time to trigger the emergency systems and face the question in all seriousness in order to save the situation. As a matter of the utmost urgency, nuclear tests have to be stopped. If testing is stopped, we have a chance to survive,"" otherwise the world will perish. I have no doubt whatever about this. We need to tell people about this frankly, without taking refuge in all sorts of specious arguments. Perhaps we should invite the parliaments of all countries to express their attitude regarding nuclear explosions and nuclear tests. We could organize a world-wide parliamentary referendum.",UNGD
RUS,1990,"What else has to happen in order to set in motion at long list the elimination of chemical weapons? The process must be completed by the conclusion of a convention. The Soviet Union and the United States are setting an example by doing this on a bilateral basis. But what about the others? It is really odd that while there is no person, no politician who would publicly call for retaining toxic agents, things are essentially at a standstill and we still have no convention.",UNGD
RUS,1990,"Perhaps we should ask for a roll-call vote here in this General Assembly Hall and see who votes against the proposal? If everyone is in favour, it will be a simple matter to set up a binding schedule for completing work on the Convention and to establish a time-frame for the destruction of chemical weapons. Similar problems, mostly concerning verification, arise with regard to biological weapons. ",UNGD
RUS,1990,"Swift and decisive action is needed on all these issues. Yet the debate at the Geneva Conference on Disarmament let us honestly admit, proceeds in a calm and leisurely manner. Can we accept this? Even as dangerous developments are gaining critical momentum in the world, the Geneva negotiations are continuing at a pace that was set at the time of the ""cold war"".",UNGD
RUS,1990,I think the negotiators at the Palais des Nations at Geneva should roll up the blinds. Let them see what is going on outside and let people know what our disarmament pundits are meditating upon.,UNGD
RUS,1990,I do not want to offend anyone. I know that those working there are honourable people. But what is to be done? The time has come to cry out to act decisively and firmly.,UNGD
RUS,1990,I cannot fail to mention yet another aspect of security.,UNGD
RUS,1990,"The world community should also consider the possibility of various ""unconventional situations"" arising from the mass taking of hostages and cases of blackmail with threats of the use of particularly dangerous and destructive weapons.",UNGD
RUS,1990,These problems will have to be addressed at two levels: technical and legal. We could start by setting up a group of experts for special contingencies under the auspices of the Security Council.,UNGD
RUS,1990,"The group could include outstanding anti-terrorism experts, psychologists, nuclear scientists, chemists, physicians, disaster-relief organizers, experts on the physical protection of facilities, and the like.",UNGD
RUS,1990,"Recommendations concerning the management of ""unconventional situations"" should be made known to a limited number of people. The Security Council may find it necessary, upon recommendation of the Military Staff Committee, to establish a rapid-response force to be formed on a contract basis from units specially designated by different countries, including the five permanent members of the Security Council. This idea also deserves consideration and discussion. ",UNGD
RUS,1990,"But technical methods alone are not enough to deal with such things. In our view, it is extremely important to institute a new norm in international law which would declare that any person who threatens to use weapons of mass destruction for purposes of blackmail, to take hostages or to engage in mass terror is guilty of a crime against humanity. Work on this has been under way for a long time somewhere in the labyrinths of this Organisation, but its end is not yet in sight.",UNGD
RUS,1990,"What we need, however, is to create, as soon as possible, a moral and legal environment in which anyone guilty of grave crimes against humanity, of participating in acts of mass repression, hostage-taking, terrorist acts or torture, and those guilty of particular cruelty in the use of force, could not escape punishment and would not be absolved from personal responsibility even if he acted under orders.",UNGD
RUS,1990,"The principle of suppressing aggression and threats to peace should, in our view, be complemented by the principle of individual responsibility and by commensurate punishment.",UNGD
RUS,1990,"The Persian Gulf crisis is causing major dislocations in the entire system of the world economy, as other speakers have pointed out. Their full magnitude is difficult even to assess at present. It is clear that the consequences will be severe for the economies of the developing countries, particularly the poorest ones. Merely stating this is not enough; action must be taken without delay It is necessary to establish, as soon as possible, an international mechanism, even if only a temporary one, for example, under the auspices of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or the World Bank, to mitigate the adverse consequences of this crisis for countries which are in a particularly vulnerable position. We are of the view that sounding out the economic repercussions of the crisis should be primarily the function of the United nations; the Organisation should be the centre of action in situations affecting the interests of many countries. ",UNGD
RUS,1990,"History, particularly modern history, teaches all kinds of lessons. They must not be ignored or underestimated. One of them is that security can hardly be lasting unless it is supported by economic growth combined with spiritual health and by traditional cultural values combined with new technologies and with a concern for the environment. Co-operation in the 1990s must therefore be geared to the resolution of the entire set of global economic and environmental problems, λ new ""poverty curtain"" this time between North and South, must not be allowed to descend. If it does, the resulting division of the world may prove fatal to our civilisation. We have no time to lose, λ global strategy for development and for solving problems common to all mankind is needed now, and the Secretary-General's report on the work of the Organisation rightly makes this point. The United Nations, supported by its specialized agencies and by outside intellectual resources, should set about formulating such a strategy.",UNGD
RUS,1990,An interdependent world calls for a new level of multilateral economic partnership. Co-operation on a bilateral basis and in selected areas is no longer enough; it is global co-operation that is needed.,UNGD
RUS,1990,"The special session of the General Assembly on international economic co-operation clearly showed that everybody would gain if each group of countries were to adjust its approaches and show willingness to forsake individual or group self-interest in economic co-operation, setting as its highest priority the interests of the common good, a global self-interest, if you will, which would no longer be selfish. We welcome the provisions of the Declaration of the special session which support the integration of the Soviet Union and East European countries into the world economy. We hope that the United Nations will give concrete expression to its support for this process.",UNGD
RUS,1990,"The Soviet contribution to these efforts will certainly be growing as we move ahead with perestroika at home, deepen our economic reform and change over to a market economy. We have firmly opted for a closer association with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GAST), IMF, the World Bank and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) with a view to joining them as soon as the necessary internal and external conditions are established. It is true that we are rather late, but none the less we have come to a firm position on this very important matter.",UNGD
RUS,1990,"We also see a unique contribution that we can make to the development of international co-operation. For geographical and other reasons, we are in a better position than others to serve as a link between Europe and Asia and to contribute to the establishment of a single Eurasian space in the economic, scientific, technological, environmental and other spheres. This will certainly be facilitated, for instance, by Soviet transport systems, main lines already in existence, and communications equipment, including space communications.",UNGD
RUS,1990,"Scientific and technological progress has become a major factor shaping the world's future. The global nature of its implications places in a new perspective the need to co-ordinate the policies of States in this area. The United Nations and its system of organisations can and must, in our view, assume a leading role in these efforts.",UNGD
RUS,1990,"This is an area in which trust among States is of special importance. Without trust, barriers to international scientific and technical co-operation cannot be dismantled. We think that the international community should take a stand against monopolists in the field of science and technology. Otherwise, it will be difficult to deal effectively with underdevelopment and the many problems of the developing world. If we succeeded in strongly focusing the global development strategy on scientific and technological progress, we could substantially mitigate such alarming trends as the brain drain, the growing migration of professionals, and the rising cost and borrowing scope of research. The United Nations would do well to take the lead in organising a global forum on the role of thought science and technology in addressing the problems of today's world. The Soviet Union is prepared to take the initiative in holding a major international forum of this kind in our country.",UNGD
RUS,1990,"Much has been said lately on environmental issues. We even run the risk of talking away our future, for up to now - I emphasise that this is at the global level - there has been much talk but little action, while the destruction of the environment is outstripping our preparations to deal with the environmental threat.",UNGD
RUS,1990,"I hope that even as we continue to prepare for the 1992 Conference on the Environment and Development in Brazil, we shall be able to start implementing specific environmental protection projects. In our view, one of the priority measures would be to establish a United Nations centre for emergency environmental assistance. We have submitted to the Secretary-General a list of Soviet scientists and specialists whom, at the request of the centre, we would be ready to send to areas of environmental disasters at our own expense to serve as members of international expert teams. ",UNGD
RUS,1990,"We are well aware that a healthy environment requires considerable investment at both the national and the global level. As we see it, the way out of the problem is reduction of military expenditure and conversion of military production. There is no alternative. The figures are well known. Bight hundred billion dollars must be spent before the end of this century to avert environmental degradation and destruction - almost the same amount as is spent by the world for military purposes each year.",UNGD
RUS,1990,"The urgency of environmental-protection problems has been highlighted by the Chernobyl tragedy. We are grateful to the Governments and the various agencies which are joining in the hard work of dealing with the consequences of the disaster. On behalf of the Soviet people, I also wish to express our gratitude to all international, governmental and public organisations and private citizens who have offered their help to the victims.",UNGD
RUS,1990,"Our special thanks go to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) and to those countries and organisations that have shown such a touching interest in Chernobyl's children, inviting them to cone for rest and medical treatment and gladdening the hearts of the children with their concern and their warmth. The Secretary-General's decision to designate a Special Representative for Chernobyl disaster relief has also been greatly appreciated in our country.",UNGD
RUS,1990,"The multi-dimensional approach to security supported by our Organisation brings into focus the interrelationship between the security of States and the well-being and freedom of the individual. The human being is coming to the fore and the human dimension is becoming a universal yardstick for any international undertaking. For us and for the United Nations the security of the individual, of every citizen, and the protection of fundamental human rights are inseparable from national security and from international security as a whole.",UNGD
RUS,1990,"I think the time has also come to look at regional conflicts from the standpoint of human rights. Those rights include the right to life and personal safety, as well as the right to en-joy fundamental freedoms and to participate in the democratic processes of one's society and one's State.",UNGD
RUS,1990,"The main task for the international community is to create conditions in which people would be able to make a free choice. Disputes must be settled not in the trenches of war but through the ballot-box, both regionally and within the individual countries and States.",UNGD
RUS,1990,"Speaking about the future, we should also like to respond to those who have been following with understandable concern the developments in our country. True, our domestic situation is not at all simple and is still far from stable. We can readily understand that concern: ours is an enormous country, with enormous potential, and the stability of the Soviet Union has a great influence on the state of the world.",UNGD
RUS,1990,"But whatever the complexity of our situation, one cannot fail to see that it is evolving against the background of the emancipation of all the peoples and all the citizens of our country, their active involvement in the political arena and the reaffirmation of their national identities. They are opening themselves to the world, and the world is discovering them.",UNGD
RUS,1990,"That this process is accompanied by some difficulties and even some costs should not cause excessive alarm, because the Soviet people and the democratic forces that are assuming responsibility for the future of our Union are aware of the Soviet Union's place in the world and of its responsibility for the maintenance of global stability. This awareness is shared by all the peoples of our multinational country, and they will all act responsibly, realising that stability in the world will also mean peace in their own home.",UNGD
RUS,1990,"In working for the renewal of our society, we have seen how important it is to defend democratic principles at all levels domestically and internationally.",UNGD
RUS,1990,"I should like to say in particular that if attempts to embark on the path of democracy were to end in failure or, worse still, in collapse, it would have grave consequences for the world's future, not to mention the risk of chaos and new dictatorships. Preventing that should be in everyone's interest.",UNGD
RUS,1990,"As we meet for the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly, we are speaking not so much of the Organisation's maturity as of the beginning of its rebirth, its restoration according to the blueprints of 1945. Wiping off the grime left by the ""cold war"", we see a work of collective wisdom. The United Nations was conceived as an instrument of action. Henceforth, we must all ensure that our words are bound to joint - and I emphasise ""joint"" - actions. Now is the time precisely for that. The philosophy of today is a philosophy of action.",UNGD
RUS,1990,"This is the sixth time that I have spoken from this rostrum and participated in the work of the General Assembly. It has certainly been a great school, a first-rate school. Where else can one become so closely involved with the entire gamut of human problems and encounter such a constellation of personalities, intellectuals, professionals and scholars, whose brilliant qualities are epitomised by the Secretary-General of our Organisation, Mr. Peres de Cuellar?",UNGD
RUS,1990,I consider myself very fortunate to have met and worked here with outstanding political leaders and great personalities during the years when the United Nations returned to being what it was meant to be - a centre for harmonising the activities of nations. ,UNGD
RUS,1991,"Mingling with the other people taking part in this General Assembly debate and looking to their faces makes one almost physically aware of fact that, today, the representatives of the Soviet Union, which is transforming itself into a union of sovereign States, are viewed - and rightly so - as envoys of a new nation. It is a nation on the threshold of an entirely new era in its centuries-old political, philosophical, international, legal and day-to-day history.",UNGD
RUS,1991,"We have just experienced a purifying storm - the defeat of a criminal coup, and everything that took place in connection with the recent Congress of People's Deputies. Today I extend the words of deep gratitude to all those who associated themselves with our resistance to the coup. Those days in August have convinced us finally of one thing - that the quest for freedom has become the main thrust in our own development and in the development of the entire world community. Only a society that gives full protection to individual freedoms and rights can be prosperous and dynamic.",UNGD
RUS,1991,"The longing for freedom and democracy has always been present in the minds and hearts of our people. It has survived despite decades of despotism and lawlessness, and the years of perestroika brought it to life with renewed vigour and translated it into concrete deeds. The courage of unarmed people stemming the advance of political monsters who opposed the new thinking proved that the peoples of our country will no longer bow the knee to diktat. In essence, the defeat of a coup aimed at restoring totalitarian rule led to a revolution that changed the face of the nation, sweeping away the last remaining pillars of a bankrupt regime.",UNGD
RUS,1991,"The failure of the coup was also a world-wide victory for the forces of good. Together, we managed to avert the threat of a return to the cold war. To remove the obstacles to progress towards a new state of interaction and partnership, towards democracy and a new era of peace-making.",UNGD
RUS,1991,"	The political developments of the first half of this year created the major prerequisites for this change. There have been breakthroughs in two central areas of disarmament - conventional arms in Europe, and strategic nuclear arms. Armaments are being reduced, although only recently it was held that an arms build-up was precisely what guarantees national security. As President Bush pointed out in his address to the General Assembly yesterday, this proves that relations between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States, between East and West, are no longer relations between adversaries. Such drastic cuts are possible only between partners who have recognized that they have shared, rather than conflicting, security interests.",UNGD
RUS,1991,"	A decisive step towards the end of the cold war has been taken in an area that is most resistant to new trends - the economy. The London meeting between the Soviet President and the G-7 leaders and subsequent contacts between the Seven and the leaders of our Union and its republics sec the stags for overcoming the economic division of the world and restoring its integrity, its economic interdependence and its market and financial fabric.",UNGD
RUS,1991,"	Iraq's aggression against Kuwait put the nascent global unity to a serious test. The world community's concerted efforts to resist the aggressor, including the efforts of the five permanent members of the Security Council, were truly unprecedented. The consensus that emerged in the United Nations around the central idea that breaches of the peace are inadmissible remained intact even after the crisis in the Gulf was over. Indeed, this consensus led to practical steps to resolve other burning issues, including the formidable challenge of the search for a Middle East settlement, and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems. Today, there remains hardly a single regional conflict where there is not a glimmer of light, at the end of the tunnel.",UNGD
RUS,1991,"Europe - once the epicentre of two world wars and an arena of confrontation - is becoming n laboratory for new forms of interaction. In fact, the process of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe already transcends regional frontiers. A new transcontinental community is coming into being - a ""belt"" of trust, cooperation and security that spans the countries of these parts of the world: the entire northern hemisphere.",UNGD
RUS,1991,"Political dialogue is getting under way in Asia and the Pacific, as nations and international associations in that region join in a search for mechanism for the discussion and collective solution of common problems. Latin America as a community of mutually tolerant and democratic nations is becoming a political reality. On the African continent, negotiations are replacing hostilities and, at times, barbaric methods of force.",UNGD
RUS,1991,"This global change is inextricably linked with perestroika in the Soviet Union. Before the events of August the progress of perestroika inside the country lagged far behind its international impact. Now that that gap has been closed, internal and external activities can proceed at a single and accelerating pace. The steadfastness of the President of the USSR, Mr. Gorbachev, the courage and initiative of Mr. Yeltsin, the Russian President, the vigorous popular movement and the overwhelming solidarity of the rest of the world enabled us not only to defeat the coup but also to dismantle the braking mechanisms that hindered the country's progress towards the rule of law and a civic society.",UNGD
RUS,1991,"To a certain extent the coup and all the risks involved are precisely what brought about a strong centrifugal trend in our country as, between 22 August and 9 September, eight republics declared themselves independent from the union. That is how they reacted to the threat posed by the putsch, the aim of which was the restoration of a totalitarian society.",UNGD
RUS,1991,"The extraordinary Congress of People's Deputies at the beginning of September met the challenge of the time, establishing for a period of transition a structure whereby the republics - to use the words of the President of Russia - would obtain as much sovereignty as they could take. Now that the element of coercion is behind us and the sovereign republics are able to take stock of the situation, there has developed a centripetal trend, which is gaining momentum.",UNGD
RUS,1991,"This is evidenced by the intensive activity of the State Council, chaired by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and comprising the leaders of the Republics. The first decision of this body was the recognition of the independence of the three Baltic States. At the second session of the Council the basic forms of an economic union - which will be open for participation by any Republic, including the Baltic States, should they so desire - were addressed and endorsed.",UNGD
RUS,1991,The State Council is working on measures to overcome the rather critical problems - to say the least - of food and medical supplies in the coming winter and spring months. The Inter-Republican Economic Committee has been very active in this regard.,UNGD
RUS,1991,"All-union government agencies constituted by the Congress continue to function in the four key areas: foreign policy, defence, law enforcement and security. Profound military reforms are taking place, these will lead to a radical cut in military expenditures, which for many years have placed such a heavy burden on the budget of our State.",UNGD
RUS,1991,"The Extraordinary Congress of People's Deputies, the State Council and the President of the USSR have thus answered the questions that had been causing world-wide concern. It can now be seen that the answers were constructive and sent a positive signal to the world community. As a dynamic, although still fragile, balance emerges between the centre and the Republics, we can see that we are now on the right course - despite the deviations or set-backs that may occur - and we look with renewed expectations to the international community for all the support it can lend us in making a rapid transition and taking a respected place in the family of nations. By stating this publicly I am fulfilling one of my important tasks at this session of the General Assembly,",UNGD
RUS,1991,"The new Union, at this decisive stage of its formation, needs the support of the world community, but it is precisely the world community that has an interest in the success of our efforts, since the prospects for creating a stable, democratic and civilised world order on our planet. Earth - which may be the only one in the universe - depend on this.",UNGD
RUS,1991,"The President of the USSR and the leaders of all sovereign States and Soviet Republics are aware of their responsibilities under the Soviet Union's existing international agreements and obligations. I should like to reaffirm that the union of sovereign States will be the direct successor of all such commitments, including those we have assumed as a nuclear Power. Our country's nuclear weapons remain under effective centralised control.",UNGD
RUS,1991,"""New challenges"" is a favourite subject of political scientists. Not so long ago this term came to denote such things as international terrorism, international drug and arms trafficking, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), degradation of the environment, and the problems of human psychological adaptation to new parameters of progress. The depth and danger of these new risks have forced the world community - and did so even back in the days of the cold war - to begin formulating adequate responses to these transnational challenges. And although the bulk of the work still lies ahead, negotiating mechanisms are already emerging and international legal instruments are being put into place.",UNGD
RUS,1991,"However, let us admit, both to ourselves and to the whole of mankind, that virtually none of us was prepared to face the risks of the new, historic period. Cleansing storms have thundered over the expanses of eastern and central Europe, bringing with them all the promise that freedom holds out, bringing back the sense of dignity, self-esteem and faith in man's lofty mission on Earth. And it is not freedom's fault if the flames of ethnic strife have suddenly engulfed the world like the outbreak of a long-forgotten disease. Age-old and seemingly subdued instincts have come alive - instincts which have no place in the new environment. And all this is accompanied by the threat of economic chaos, flaring social contradictions, refugees and disease.",UNGD
RUS,1991,"Europe, which had seemed the least vulnerable of all the continents, has suddenly shown its susceptibility to the virus of nationalism. After the division of Europe had been overcome without confrontation or instability and Germany had been peacefully and democratically reunited, Yugoslavia faced a crisis and is now on the brink of civil war.",UNGD
RUS,1991,"Why this un-preparedness for new risks? We were too busy eliminating the deformations of the cold-war era to formulate in good time a positive agenda that would meet national aspirations. Regrettably, the energy released as a result of East-West reconciliation has not only served constructive purposes but also fuelled a resurgence of national egotism. Nationalism is becoming the main breeding ground for terrorism. The mortar attack on Downing Street, the villainous assassination of Rajiv Ghandi, the bloodshed which is still going on in Nagorny Karabakh, and elsewhere, are convincing evidence of that.",UNGD
RUS,1991,"There is a danger that the ideological division of the world may be replaced by attempts to divide and antagonize countries, peoples and nations on national, ethnic or religious grounds. The result may be the nineteenth century revisited, albeit it with significant new features, such as global interdependence and weapons of mass destruction.",UNGD
RUS,1991,"The problem is how to make the growing national self-awareness serve the cause of progress, freedom and the prosperity of people; to keep national identity slogans from becoming vehicles of separatist policies leading away from the mainstream of world integration to absurd autarchy in either economic or cultural life.",UNGD
RUS,1991,"Whenever national egotism spills over State borders as was the case with Iraq's aggression against Kuwait, the international community must remain true to its position of principle and take the necessary steps, including enforcement measures, in keeping with the United Nations Charter. Of course, military force - or using it in appropriate measure - should be the last resort. Using it even to maintain international law and order necessarily means a set-back for the new thinking, a reversal of the trend towards establishing a new type of international relations. Today, the international community and the United Nations have sufficient capabilities to curb an aggressor, whoever he may be, and to restore justice without the use of military force - or using it in appropriate measure and on a collective basis.",UNGD
RUS,1991,There is also a certain degree of understanding with regard to ethnic conflicts of a purely domestic nature. The golden rule in this respect is to do no harm.,UNGD
RUS,1991,"Problems arise also in the grey zone between internal jurisdiction and international responsibility. Basically, it is a question of the further development of the sovereignty principle in international law, as applied to the new realities and risks and to the need for universal interaction between States.",UNGD
RUS,1991,"Consensus must be achieved on a set of basic rules, criteria and principles for international response by the world community to emergency situations, a kind of code of responsible conduct for States, in an era of an interrelated and integral world. Such a consensus should combine the principles of sovereignty, self-determination and non-interference in the internal affairs of States with the need for States to fulfil their obligations under the United Nations Charter and other international legal instruments, and for the United Nations to pursue its goals in all the spheres prescribed by its Charter.",UNGD
RUS,1991,"The principal objective hare is to harmonise national, regional and global interests, to assert a single universal scale of democratic values providing for freedom of choice, a variety of forms of social development, economic and political pluralism and the supremacy of international law and human rights.",UNGD
RUS,1991,The problem of individual freedom in all its dimensions is becoming central in world politics today. Providing for all basic human rights has become an imperative both of national development and international relations.,UNGD
RUS,1991,"The gravest challenges arise in the world economy. Imbalances and deformations are the inevitable companions of economic progress. On the one hand, the end of the cold war has put an end to bloc rivalry in dealing with the third world. Against the background of interdependence, development ceases to be a one-dimensional notion and assumes a universal character. This is the key to a balanced world economy and to providing a solid basis for resolving global issues. On the other hand, there are growing fears that the new East-West relationship will leave many developing nations on the periphery of the world economy. At the same time, the third world is becoming increasingly polarized. Economic success in a number of countries is accompanied by worsening crises, poverty and hunger in the poorest nations. To prevent accumulated contradictions from exploding is a priority task. Moving away from ideologically motivated assistance should not mean forgetting those who simply cannot survive without outside help.",UNGD
RUS,1991,"The same applies to the factors which hamper progress towards environmental security. Chernobyl became a world-wide disaster. Yet, it is also a symbol of international solidarity in a struggle for survival and the triumph of humanism in relations between States. The United Nations Chernobyl Pledging Conference, which was held here recently, demonstrated this once again.",UNGD
RUS,1991,One of the lessons to be learned from Chernobyl and other environmental catastrophes is that there can be no effective way of avoiding disaster without overcoming the inertia of old industrial practices. The objective is to readjust the whole structure of the world economy to make it environmentally safe. This can only be achieved through concerted efforts.,UNGD
RUS,1991,"New international relations should be universal. Within generally recognised norms of civilised behaviour, a11 nations, regardless of their ideological or political preferences and dislikes, should maintain normal and proper relations. Lingering hostility, let alone the lack of elementary dialogue between a number of States, objectively generates tension within the very fabric of international relations.",UNGD

RUS,1991,"The new world realities of today require institutionalised security and cooperation structures, the modernization of existing mechanisms and the creation of new ones where necessary.

It was at that time - two years ago - that conceptual agreement was reached to begin drafting the fundamental principles of civilised international communication at the current stage of history - sometimes referred to as the new world order.",UNGD
RUS,1991,"Members may recall that that resolution was the joint initiative of the USSR and the United States. When I met President Bush today, we reiterated the commitment of our two countries to broader cooperation in strengthening the United Nations as well as in all other areas. This commitment rests on a new foundation in the Soviet-United States relationship - no longer one of confrontation or even rivalry, but cooperation and friendship for the good of the world community as a whole.",UNGD
RUS,1991,"The philosophy of new international solidarity, which is finding its way into practice, signifies a de-ideologization of the United Nations. In renewing our Organisation we should once and for all leave behind us the legacy of the ice age - like the obnoxious resolution equating Zionism with racism.",UNGD
RUS,1991,"A transition to partnership and collective action bears the promise of United Nations universality, both in terms of its membership and in terms of its areas of activity. The process has already been set in motion. At this session of the General Assembly new Members have joined the ranks of the Organization. These include States of differing size and population. Our support for their admission to the United Nations mirrors the overall Soviet foreign policy of developing relations with all States, including small and medium-sized States.",UNGD
RUS,1991,"It is with a special feeling that I wish to congratulate our colleagues, the plenipotentiary representatives of new sovereign and independent States - the Latvian Republic, the Lithuanian Republic and the Estonian Republic.",UNGD
RUS,1991,I see special symbolism in the fact that one of the first foreign policy steps of the country which began its new political calendar recently was to recognize the full independence of the Baltic Republics and provide immediate support for their joining the United Nations end associating themselves with the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) process. That took place in Moscow at the beginning of the Conference on the Human Dimension. At the present time the process of establishing diplomatic relations and exchanging embassies between the USSR and the Baltic States has started. We are going to hold large-scale talks on vital issues affecting the destinies of millions of people.,UNGD
RUS,1991,"Adapting the entire United Nations system to the new realities of international life is an item on our agenda. Progress has already been achieved in such adaptation and great credit for this goes to the Secretary-General. Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, who is a confident leader of the Organization at this juncture which is perhaps most decisive. We hope that the line he so strongly supports will be duly continued.",UNGD
RUS,1991,There is a wealth of promising ideas on this subject. It would appear to make sense to agree upon launching practical exploration of approaches to reforming the United Nations. We are open to any fruitful ideas; we are also working on our own proposals. A concerted and essentially collective regulation of international relations in the areas of security and disarmament crucial for the destiny of the world has become a priority in the activities of the United Nations end the world community.,UNGD
RUS,1991,"Supremacy of law is the main point of reference on the way to shaping a new model of international security. A system of political and legal deterrence should be its cornerstone - a system based not on mutual deterrence but rather on confidence that mutual threat does not exist and also on a high level of trust and openness in the military and other spheres. To achieve thin, it is important to establish, with active United Nations involvement, an atmosphere of general aversion to aggression throughout the world community. Any act of aggression must, from the very start, be regarded as doomed, not only militarily but also politically, economically and morally. An international boycott is the first step to deter and warn the aggressor.",UNGD
RUS,1991,"Next in line is a joint elaboration and implementation of the concept of the next stage of disarmament to absorb the experience gained and make the disarmament processes stable, comprehensive and universal.",UNGD
RUS,1991,Priority tasks include making military potentials exclusively defence-oriented and working out the guidelines States could follow while restructuring their armed forces in conformity with the doctrine of reasonable sufficiency. That now is taking place in the Soviet Union.,UNGD
RUS,1991,"The General Assembly could recommend initiating, as an intermediate stage, consultations to work on specific quantitative and qualitative parameters for minimum nuclear deterrence in all its aspects. It is becoming an urgent task to conduct negotiations on the total elimination of tactical nuclear weapons in as short as time as possible. ",UNGD
RUS,1991,"A reduction in the number of nuclear tests, with a view to phasing them out altogether as soon as possible, is one means of halting the nuclear arms race. A broad movement in support of this idea has materialized in the political and scientific communities and among the public in various countries of the world. The time has come to establish a United Nations register of conventional arms sales and supplies and to identify jointly its technical parameters with a view to arriving at agreed principles of restraint in arms sales.",UNGD
RUS,1991,"The development of a long-term concept of the use of United Nations forces in accordance with the Charter of the Organization, including the refinement of rapid response mechanisms for countering threats to international peace, legally codified procedures for deterring a potential aggressor and optimal strategies for defusing conflicts, would facilitate more comprehensive utilization of United Nations capacities. Major tasks in this area include efforts to make United Nations peace-keeping operations more effective and institutionalized, broader use of the preventive capacities of the United Nations and efforts to find ways to correlate global and regional security structures. There is proof that conflicts can indeed be settled through national reconciliation, a balance of interests and responsibility among all the parties involved and the expression of the will of the people in democratic free elections. I am particularly pleased to note the important role that is to be played by the United Nations in implementing the settlement in Cambodia as a truly unique instrument for maintaining international peace.",UNGD
RUS,1991,Today a unique chance is at hand to set in motion the process of a Middle East settlement. It is essential to lock in the significant pi ogress that has been made in solving the Afghan problem. This session must take action to support efforts in these areas.,UNGD
RUS,1991,"The ultimate beneficiary of the movement towards stable peace with maximum guarantees is the human being. The domestic policies of States and the practice of international communication should rest on uniform rules applied across the entire range of human rights as an inseparable set of equal categories of a political, civil, social, economic and cultural nature defining the status of the individual and his relations with the State and society. Substantive discussion of specific human rights issues and matters of compliance with international commitments in this area can no longer be dismissed under the artificial pretext of interference in internal affairs. By signing appropriate international instruments, every State, as it were, delegates a fraction of its sovereignty to the international community. The criterion is the primacy of human rights over the rights of nations and other bodies.",UNGD
RUS,1991,"At the Moscow meeting of the CSCE conference on the human dimension, we focused on the problem of strengthening not only the national, but also the international basis of guarantees for democracy, political pluralism, the supremacy of law and human rights.",UNGD
RUS,1991,"We might provide for far-reaching collective procedures that would ultimately include binding and mandatory elements. Non-governmental and human rights organisations should be actively encouraged to participate in their verification. In other words, after the Moscow conference, the concept of confidence-building measures, which has been put to work so successfully in the political and military fields since the conferences held in Madrid and Stockholm should, we firmly believe, become the cornerstone and driving force of the new turn to human rights within the all-European and the global context.",UNGD
RUS,1991,"	Much has been done in the United Nations, but there are still greater tasks ahead, reflecting the risks and challenges that face the international community today. Our common and inseparable destinies largely, if not decisively, depend on whether the United Nations will be able to succeed in renovating itself and become a true multilateral guarantor of peace and security.",UNGD
RUS,1991,"Today all of us, politicians and diplomats alike, constantly find ourselves with the word ""space"" on our tongues. We speak of a single economic, legal and ecological space. This has become an extremely up-to-date and fashionable expression. Yet, half a century ago, in the heyday of Stalin's tyranny, the great Russian poet, Boris Pasternak, used it to describe an artist's calling!",UNGD
RUS,1991,"""We have to live without vainglory Live in such a way that after all A love that space bestows upon us Would let us hear the future's call.""",UNGD
RUS,1991,The call of the future! The author of Doctor Zhivago and the winner of the Nobel Prize heeded this call. Let us also heed it.,UNGD
RUS,1992,,UNGD
RUS,1992,"First, I wish to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to this ",UNGD
RUS,1992,important post. The fact that a representative of Bulgaria has assumed this ,UNGD
RUS,1992,post at the head of the Assembly at precisely this time is a sign of the ,UNGD
RUS,1992,importance that the world community attaches to the peaceful democratic ,UNGD
RUS,1992,"revolution in Eastern Europe. And we are proud that our countries, linked by ",UNGD
RUS,1992,"ties of traditional friendship, are treading this path together. ",UNGD
RUS,1992,The democratic movement has prevailed in the cold war. For the first ,UNGD
RUS,1992,time in history unprecedented opportunities have opened up for the ,UNGD
RUS,1992,implementation of the principles proclaimed by the United Nations. ,UNGD
RUS,1992,,UNGD
RUS,1992,The post-confrontational and post-communist world is not a ,UNGD
RUS,1992,"pax Sovietica. a pax Americana, a pax Islamica or a pax Christiana, nor is it ",UNGD
RUS,1992,"a monopolistic system of any kind, but rather the multipolar unity in ",UNGD
RUS,1992,diversity that the United Nations has symbolized from the very outset. ,UNGD
RUS,1992,"For the present, such a world is only a possibility yet to be realized ",UNGD
RUS,1992,through our joint efforts. Realism leaves no room for euphoria. A difficult ,UNGD
RUS,1992,period of transition lies ahead. But realism compels us to reject any ,UNGD
RUS,1992,alternative to the democratic choice. ,UNGD
RUS,1992,"Russia, which has rejected communism, has, perhaps more than any other ",UNGD
RUS,1992,"country, learned from its own experience that there can be no alternative to ",UNGD
RUS,1992,democratic development; our country voted for democracy during the first ,UNGD
RUS,1992,"nation-wide presidential election in its history, and defended it at the ",UNGD
RUS,1992,"barricades around the Moscow White House. Neither the President, nor the ",UNGD
RUS,1992,"Government, nor the majority of Parliament, nor the country at large will turn ",UNGD
RUS,1992,"aside from the path of reform, no matter how difficult it may prove. ",UNGD
RUS,1992,Totalitarianism robbed Russia both of its unique identity and of the ,UNGD
RUS,1992,possibility of self-fulfilment in its relations with other nations. Through ,UNGD
RUS,1992,"its self-imposed isolation, the richest country of Eurasia became the sick man ",UNGD
RUS,1992,"of Europe and Asia. In contrast, only an open society and a policy of ",UNGD
RUS,1992,openness will enable Russia to find and play to the fullest extent its unique ,UNGD
RUS,1992,and historic role. ,UNGD
RUS,1992,This policy has its roots in an age-old Russian idea. Back in the ,UNGD
RUS,1992,"thirteenth century Saint Alexander Nevsky, one of the founders and defenders ",UNGD
RUS,1992,"of the Russian State, said: ""God is to be found not in power but in truth"". ",UNGD
RUS,1992,,UNGD
RUS,1992,Today this is the policy of the true national interests of the Russian ,UNGD
RUS,1992,"State as a normal rather than an aggressive great Power, as one that ",UNGD
RUS,1992,recognizes and shoulders its responsibilities as a permanent member of the ,UNGD
RUS,1992,Security Council. ,UNGD
RUS,1992,The basic elements of this policy are as follows: partnership and ,UNGD
RUS,1992,alliance for democracy and a dynamic market economy with countries that share ,UNGD
RUS,1992,these values; good-neighbourly relations with all neighbouring States; ,UNGD
RUS,1992,"comprehensive strengthening of the Commonwealth of Independent States, ",UNGD
RUS,1992,"strategic partnership with Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and all ",UNGD
RUS,1992,other countries created in the place of the former Soviet Union; and ,UNGD
RUS,1992,solidarity and mutually advantageous cooperation with all the members of the ,UNGD
RUS,1992,world community. ,UNGD
RUS,1992,Russia intends to act in support of United Nations efforts to address ,UNGD
RUS,1992,the twofold task of the democratization of societies and the renewal of ,UNGD
RUS,1992,international relations. This is consonant with the concluding statement of ,UNGD
RUS,1992,"the summit meeting of the Security Council, with Secretary-General ",UNGD
RUS,1992,"Boutros Boutros-Ghali's report ""An Agenda for Peace"" and with the first ",UNGD
RUS,1992,statements already made from this rostrum. Russia is ready to give practical ,UNGD
RUS,1992,"support to the proposals made yesterday by George Bush, President of the ",UNGD
RUS,1992,United States. ,UNGD
RUS,1992,"First of all, it is necessary to extinguish armed conflicts. ",UNGD
RUS,1992,The Russian Federation will increase its efforts to eliminate conflicts ,UNGD
RUS,1992,"inherited from the past in the territory of the former USSR, bearing in mind ",UNGD
RUS,1992,the special interest and responsibility of Russia in strengthening the ,UNGD
RUS,1992,civilized principles of the United Nations and the Conference on Security and ,UNGD
RUS,1992,Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) in this part of the world. ,UNGD
RUS,1992,,UNGD
RUS,1992,Russia supports the participation of the new independent States in these ,UNGD
RUS,1992,two organizations and other international forums. We welcome their ,UNGD
RUS,1992,representatives in this Hall. ,UNGD
RUS,1992,"We categorically reject imperialistic ambitions, diktat and violence, ",UNGD
RUS,1992,both in the area of the former USSR and in other parts of the world. Should ,UNGD
RUS,1992,"political means fail, force can and should be used to separate the warring ",UNGD
RUS,1992,"sides, to protect human rights and humanitarian missions and to restore peace ",UNGD
RUS,1992,in strict conformity with the Charter of the United Nations. ,UNGD
RUS,1992,Agreements for cease-fires and for the establishment of peace-keeping ,UNGD
RUS,1992,"forces, concluded with Russian participation, are already in effect in ",UNGD
RUS,1992,"Ossetia, the Dniester region and Abkhazia, where Russian soldiers are carrying ",UNGD
RUS,1992,"out their peace-keeping duties. Together with CSCE, we will strive to end the ",UNGD
RUS,1992,war and bring peace to Karabakh and to secure the integrity of Tajikistan and ,UNGD
RUS,1992,bring national reconciliation to that country. In all those efforts we count ,UNGD
RUS,1992,on continued active cooperation with the United Nations. ,UNGD
RUS,1992,We support efforts aimed at forcing Iraq to implement the decisions of ,UNGD
RUS,1992,the United Nations and ensuring at the same time the territorial integrity and ,UNGD
RUS,1992,"the peaceful nature of that State. For that purpose, Russia has sent two ",UNGD
RUS,1992,naval vessels to the Persian Gulf. ,UNGD
RUS,1992,We also must ensure that the demands of the Security Council are ,UNGD
RUS,1992,complied with by all the Yugoslav sides and must enable them to maintain ,UNGD
RUS,1992,contact with the United Nations. A Russian infantry battalion is serving ,UNGD
RUS,1992,honourably with the United Nations forces in Yugoslavia. ,UNGD
RUS,1992,I agree with the preceding speaker concerning the need to support the ,UNGD
RUS,1992,efforts of Mr. Panic for the practical implementation of the intentions he has ,UNGD
RUS,1992,declared. ,UNGD
RUS,1992, ,UNGD
RUS,1992,Russia will continue to cooperate actively with the other permanent ,UNGD
RUS,1992,members of the Security Council and with all the parties concerned in ,UNGD
RUS,1992,order to seize the opportunity for a peaceful settlement in the Middle ,UNGD
RUS,1992,"East, Cambodia, Angola and other areas of conflict. ",UNGD
RUS,1992,We have no doubt that it is the task of the United Nations to combat ,UNGD
RUS,1992,"violence with force based on law, with its potential for enforcing peace. ",UNGD
RUS,1992,The Blue Helmets should take action in response even when they are fired ,UNGD
RUS,1992,upon. ,UNGD
RUS,1992,It is time to strengthen the capacity of the Security Council to ,UNGD
RUS,1992,take swift and decisive action in humanitarian emergency situations ,UNGD
RUS,1992,"arising from mass violations of human rights and inter-ethnic clashes, ",UNGD
RUS,1992,including those within national borders. ,UNGD
RUS,1992,,UNGD
RUS,1992,It is important to strengthen the preventive component of United Nations ,UNGD
RUS,1992,activities. This includes the establishment of hot lines to United Nations ,UNGD
RUS,1992,"Headquarters, the submission of intelligence information to the ",UNGD
RUS,1992,Secretary-General and the further development of fact-finding. ,UNGD
RUS,1992,Enhanced United Nations efforts to safeguard human rights and the rights ,UNGD
RUS,1992,of national minorities are also a priority. In the past it was chiefly the ,UNGD
RUS,1992,victims of totalitarian regimes and ideologies who needed protection. What is ,UNGD
RUS,1992,increasingly needed now is to combat the aggressive nationalism that is ,UNGD
RUS,1992,emerging as the new global threat. ,UNGD
RUS,1992,The replacement of ideological intolerance with national and religious ,UNGD
RUS,1992,intolerance would threaten the world which is increasingly becoming one ,UNGD
RUS,1992,"world - with rifts just as serious and with national, regional and global ",UNGD
RUS,1992,"catastrophes. Democratic Russia categorically rejects any form of chauvinism, ",UNGD
RUS,1992,be it Russophobia or anti-Semitism. ,UNGD
RUS,1992,We feel special concern at the growing discriminatory practices against ,UNGD
RUS,1992,"Russians, Ukrainians, Jews and all other non-indigenous nationalities in some ",UNGD
RUS,1992,"of the new States that have emerged in the territory of the former USSR, ",UNGD
RUS,1992,particularly in Estonia and Latvia. A situation in which 42 per cent of the ,UNGD
RUS,1992,population of the Estonian Republic are disenfranchised is totally ,UNGD
RUS,1992,inconsistent with international law. ,UNGD
RUS,1992,We have raised and will continue to raise these issues in the United ,UNGD
RUS,1992,"Nations and other forums. We have the right to do so, among other reasons, ",UNGD
RUS,1992,"because the countries in question won their independence, to a substantial ",UNGD
RUS,1992,"extent, through the triumph of the democrats in Russia. The practices I have ",UNGD
RUS,1992,"referred to can in no way be justified by invoking the problem, inherited from ",UNGD
RUS,1992,"the USSR, of the withdrawal of armed forces from the Baltic States. We are ",UNGD
RUS,1992,,UNGD
RUS,1992,"already working together to resolve that problem, and we intend to resolve it ",UNGD
RUS,1992,"as soon as possible; however, due regard must also be given to the rights of ",UNGD
RUS,1992,those who are in military uniform. ,UNGD
RUS,1992,It would be appropriate to give thought to a joint interpretation of the ,UNGD
RUS,1992,international trusteeship system set forth in the Charter of the United ,UNGD
RUS,1992,"Nations, particularly since one of its basic objectives is and I quote the ",UNGD
RUS,1992,"Charter - ""To encourage respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms ",UNGD
RUS,1992,"for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion"". That ",UNGD
RUS,1992,system has brought many nations to independence. Today national minorities ,UNGD
RUS,1992,desperately need the trusteeship of the world community. ,UNGD
RUS,1992,The fate of former Soviet servicemen taken prisoner in Afghanistan ,UNGD
RUS,1992,remains one of the gravest humanitarian problems. We call upon the General ,UNGD
RUS,1992,Assembly to proclaim its support for the urgent resolution of this problem. ,UNGD
RUS,1992,"The rejection of the game of ""nuclear roulette"" in favour of cooperation ",UNGD
RUS,1992,in the interests of strategic stability for all and with the participation of ,UNGD
RUS,1992,all States concerned is reflected in the agreements on further drastic cuts in ,UNGD
RUS,1992,strategic offensive arms and on a global defense system reached in Washington ,UNGD
RUS,1992,by the Presidents of Russia and the United States of America. ,UNGD
RUS,1992,Reaffirming its commitments under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of ,UNGD
RUS,1992,"Nuclear Weapons, the Russian Federation invites all countries that have not ",UNGD
RUS,1992,yet done so to join the Treaty as non-nuclear-weapon States. It is our belief ,UNGD
RUS,1992,"that all the former Republics of the USSR, including Ukraine, Belarus and ",UNGD
RUS,1992,"Kazakhstan, will do so. This step should be taken as soon as possible, since ",UNGD
RUS,1992,the entry into force of the treaty on strategic offensive arms depends on it. ,UNGD
RUS,1992,,UNGD
RUS,1992,We expect that a sense of high responsibility and a readiness to reach ,UNGD
RUS,1992,compromise solutions will prevail in the decisive phase of the approval of the ,UNGD
RUS,1992,Convention on the banning of chemical weapons. ,UNGD
RUS,1992,"Russia is in favour of control, including control through the United ",UNGD
RUS,1992,"Nations, over international arms transfers, especially over offensive and ",UNGD
RUS,1992,highly destructive weapons. The approach taken with respect to regimes that ,UNGD
RUS,1992,disregard the standards of international law should be particularly strict. ,UNGD
RUS,1992,There is an obvious need for the development of concrete ,UNGD
RUS,1992,"military-industry conversion programmes, not only through the efforts of ",UNGD
RUS,1992,individual countries but also through the combined action of the international ,UNGD
RUS,1992,community. The United Nations and its specialized agencies could play a ,UNGD
RUS,1992,"pioneering role in this endeavour. In the long run, real disarmament and the ",UNGD
RUS,1992,conversion of military industries to peaceful production will make it possible ,UNGD
RUS,1992,to release additional resources for the needs of development. ,UNGD
RUS,1992,But development cannot be achieved without ensuring full political and ,UNGD
RUS,1992,"economic rights and freedoms, without releasing human creative potential in a ",UNGD
RUS,1992,market environment. Russia has learned this from its own experience. ,UNGD
RUS,1992,"For a successful solution of the problems of development, it is extremely ",UNGD
RUS,1992,important to strengthen the interaction between the United Nations and the ,UNGD
RUS,1992,Bretton Woods institutions. Herein lies the key to the harmonization of the ,UNGD
RUS,1992,world community's efforts in such areas as support of macroeconomic reforms ,UNGD
RUS,1992,and technical assistance and the provision of help in resolving social ,UNGD
RUS,1992,problems. Both developing and developed countries will benefit from this. ,UNGD
RUS,1992,The United Nations Conference at Rio de Janeiro reinforced the consensus ,UNGD
RUS,1992,on the need to integrate development policies and environmental protection. ,UNGD
RUS,1992,,UNGD
RUS,1992,The task of renewing international relations calls for the ,UNGD
RUS,1992,rationalization of the United Nations itself and of the United Nations ,UNGD
RUS,1992,system. The desire of some States to play a more active role in the United ,UNGD
RUS,1992,Nations is quite natural. The Charter provides ample scope for this. In ,UNGD
RUS,1992,"particular, the Charter permits the Security Council to establish auxiliary ",UNGD
RUS,1992,bodies in which many States would participate. We are convinced that the ,UNGD
RUS,1992,United Nations and other international organizations will play a growing role ,UNGD
RUS,1992,in regulating international relations. ,UNGD
RUS,1992,"In conclusion, I should like to address you, Mr. Secretary-General. ",UNGD
RUS,1992,Russia supports your efforts to bring about the settlement of international ,UNGD
RUS,1992,"crises, to improve the efficiency of the United Nations Secretariat and the ",UNGD
RUS,1992,coordination of the activities of all international agencies. ,UNGD

RUS,1992,period from September of this year to March 1993 Russia will pay $130 million ,UNGD

RUS,1993,"At the same time, developments in the former",UNGD

RUS,1993,"Outbursts of violence caused by xenophobia, even in",UNGD

RUS,1993,today than nuclear war was yesterday. The world,UNGD
RUS,1993,community mustered the strength to stave off the nuclear,UNGD

RUS,1993,its implementation under United Nations command.,UNGD
RUS,1993,Twice during wartime I have had occasion to visit,UNGD

RUS,1993,"world, a reminder that political violence and intolerance",UNGD
RUS,1993,under the banner of religion are the worst possible crimes,UNGD
RUS,1993,"against religion itself and the human spirit. In any case, it",UNGD
RUS,1993,is surely time to think of establishing closer contacts,UNGD
RUS,1993,between the United Nations and the world’s leading,UNGD
RUS,1993,religions.,UNGD
RUS,1993,The international community seems to have turned a,UNGD
RUS,1993,blind eye to Afghanistan and Angola as soon as they ceased,UNGD
RUS,1993,to be pawns in the cold war. The United Nations has no,UNGD
RUS,1993,right to leave millions of people who live there in the grip,UNGD
RUS,1993,"of an epidemic of ethnic, clan and religious extremism and",UNGD
RUS,1993,"to forget their economic and humanitarian problems,",UNGD
RUS,1993,including that of the liberation of former Soviet prisoners of,UNGD
RUS,1993,war.,UNGD
RUS,1993,We must learn the lessons of the United Nations,UNGD
RUS,1993,operation in Somalia and considerably improve its,UNGD
RUS,1993,effectiveness. Conscious of its special responsibility for,UNGD
RUS,1993,"maintaining peace, Russia has made peacemaking and the",UNGD
RUS,1993,"protection of human rights, particularly those of national",UNGD
RUS,1993,"minorities, the priority of its foreign policy, first and",UNGD
RUS,1993,foremost in the territory of the former USSR.,UNGD
RUS,1993,We will spare no effort to strengthen the,UNGD
RUS,1993,Commonwealth of Independent States and make it a positive,UNGD
RUS,1993,"factor, not only regionally, but globally. I call upon",UNGD
RUS,1993,Members of the United Nations to support proposals,UNGD
RUS,1993,submitted jointly by the members of the Commonwealth of,UNGD
RUS,1993,"Independent States to the present session, relating in",UNGD
RUS,1993,particular to the non-proliferation of weapons of mass,UNGD
RUS,1993,"destruction, the struggle against international terrorism and",UNGD
RUS,1993,the protection of the environment.,UNGD
RUS,1993,Our peacemaking efforts are already yielding their first,UNGD
RUS,1993,results. For more than a year now there have been no,UNGD
RUS,1993,hostilities in the Transdniester region and South Ossetia.,UNGD
RUS,1993,"With our participation, the process of normalization of the",UNGD
RUS,1993,situation and national dialogue has started in Tajikistan.,UNGD
RUS,1993,Russia is making active efforts to put an end to the,UNGD
RUS,1993,Abkhazian and Karabakh conflicts and to render,UNGD
RUS,1993,humanitarian assistance to their victims.,UNGD
RUS,1993,All these problems are too serious and too tragic for,UNGD
RUS,1993,"speculation about neo-imperial plans of Russia, diplomatic",UNGD
RUS,1993,"rivalry, or the search for new spheres of influence by",UNGD
RUS,1993,"neighbouring and distant Powers. The United Nations, the",UNGD
RUS,1993,"Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE),",UNGD
RUS,1993,"and all States truly interested in peace, along with Russia,",UNGD
RUS,1993,will have enough work to do together. We want to see,UNGD
RUS,1993,"much more active assistance for our peacemaking efforts,",UNGD
RUS,1993,"not in words, but in deeds.",UNGD
RUS,1993,In most cases this means that the United Nations should,UNGD
RUS,1993,give a mandate for operations conducted at the request of,UNGD
RUS,1993,conflicting parties on the basis of appropriate agreements.,UNGD
RUS,1993,"For this, close interaction with the United Nations and the",UNGD
RUS,1993,"CSCE missions is essential. Also, our minds should be open",UNGD
RUS,1993,"to non-traditional methods, such as the participation of",UNGD
RUS,1993,contingents of the conflicting parties themselves and those,UNGD
RUS,1993,of a neighbouring mediating State. The pragmatic nature of,UNGD
RUS,1993,such a model was shown in particular in the Transdniester,UNGD
RUS,1993,"region and in South Ossetia. This model should be used,",UNGD
RUS,1993,"and not disregarded, in other regions, in the interests of the",UNGD
RUS,1993,"United Nations, which is facing an overload of peace-",UNGD
RUS,1993,keeping operations. The collective peacemaking forces of,UNGD
RUS,1993,the Commonwealth of Independent States could also interact,UNGD
RUS,1993,with the United Nations itself. It is in any case time to,UNGD
RUS,1993,establish closer relations between the two organizations.,UNGD
RUS,1993,In material and financial terms the burden of,UNGD
RUS,1993,peacemaking borne by Russia alone today in the territory of,UNGD
RUS,1993,the former USSR must be lightened. This could mean,UNGD
RUS,1993,"establishing a voluntary fund for this purpose. Of course,",UNGD
RUS,1993,Russia realizes that no international organization or group of,UNGD
RUS,1993,States can replace our peacemaking efforts in this specific,UNGD
RUS,1993,post-Soviet area.,UNGD
RUS,1993,16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session,UNGD
RUS,1993,"By and large, taking into consideration the wide",UNGD
RUS,1993,"experience gained throughout the world, it is time to think",UNGD
RUS,1993,of a modern overall strategy of peacemaking which would,UNGD
RUS,1993,"be integrated with ""An Agenda for Peace"" proposed by the",UNGD
RUS,1993,Secretary-General.,UNGD
RUS,1993,"The Russian Federation, as an initiator of the statement",UNGD
RUS,1993,of the President of the Security Council on peacemaking and,UNGD
RUS,1993,"peace-keeping issues, made on 28 May 1993, makes the",UNGD
RUS,1993,following proposals.,UNGD
RUS,1993,The first is to define a clear-cut concept of political,UNGD
RUS,1993,"leadership by the Security Council, create an effective",UNGD
RUS,1993,military command under the supervision of the Secretary-,UNGD
RUS,1993,"General and establish a procedure for involving, on that",UNGD
RUS,1993,"basis, regional organizations.",UNGD
RUS,1993,The second is to establish under Article 29 of the,UNGD
RUS,1993,United Nations Charter a special Security Council committee,UNGD
RUS,1993,on improving peace-keeping operation practices. This could,UNGD
RUS,1993,include those States which have already gained considerable,UNGD
RUS,1993,experience in this area of United Nations activity.,UNGD
RUS,1993,Our third proposal is to set up United Nations stand-by,UNGD
RUS,1993,forces which would be at the disposal of Member States and,UNGD
RUS,1993,used in peacemaking operations with the consent of their,UNGD
RUS,1993,Governments on a case-by-case basis at the request of the,UNGD
RUS,1993,Secretary-General.,UNGD
RUS,1993,All these questions directly relate to the process of,UNGD
RUS,1993,renewal of the United Nations. The reform of United,UNGD
RUS,1993,"Nations bodies, including the Security Council, will make",UNGD
RUS,1993,sense and be effective if it allows for a more adequate,UNGD
RUS,1993,response to new challenges in the field of peacemaking.,UNGD
RUS,1993,The settlement of conflicts should go hand in hand with,UNGD
RUS,1993,the international protection of their victims. As a follow-up,UNGD
RUS,1993,to the Geneva International Conference on the Protection of,UNGD
RUS,1993,"Victims of War, we propose that international legal",UNGD
RUS,1993,restrictions be imposed on the use in internal conflicts of the,UNGD
RUS,1993,"most destructive and indiscriminate types of weapons,",UNGD
RUS,1993,primarily military aircraft and artillery-rocket systems. We,UNGD
RUS,1993,should also eliminate or call a halt to the use of mercenaries,UNGD
RUS,1993,and volunteers both in domestic and international conflicts.,UNGD
RUS,1993,We propose the establishment of a permanent,UNGD
RUS,1993,international tribunal to deal with crimes against humanity.,UNGD
RUS,1993,The inevitability of punishment will help to prevent the,UNGD
RUS,1993,recurrence of such atrocities.,UNGD
RUS,1993,It has become crucially important to address,UNGD
RUS,1993,comprehensively the problem of refugees and to specify the,UNGD
RUS,1993,relevant principles of international law at a special,UNGD
RUS,1993,conference.,UNGD
RUS,1993,Peacemaking cannot be separated from the protection,UNGD
RUS,1993,of human rights. The international community is duty-bound,UNGD
RUS,1993,"to condemn strongly ""double"" or lower standards of human",UNGD
RUS,1993,"rights protection, the theory and practice of the superiority",UNGD
RUS,1993,"of rights of an ""indigenous"" nation and the creation of mono-",UNGD
RUS,1993,ethnic States. The time has come to establish a United,UNGD
RUS,1993,Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Following,UNGD
RUS,1993,the example of the Conference on Security and Cooperation,UNGD
RUS,1993,"in Europe, it is time for the United Nations also to have a",UNGD
RUS,1993,Special Rapporteur on National Minorities. We support the,UNGD
RUS,1993,proposals of the Secretary-General in the field of human,UNGD
RUS,1993,rights protection.,UNGD
RUS,1993,The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction would,UNGD
RUS,1993,directly contradict the peacemaking efforts of the United,UNGD
RUS,1993,Nations. This poses an ever growing threat not only in the,UNGD
RUS,1993,future but even at the present. We are ready to cooperate,UNGD
RUS,1993,with the United States and other countries in solving the,UNGD
RUS,1993,problems connected with cutting off fissionable material,UNGD
RUS,1993,production and banning the construction of facilities for such,UNGD
RUS,1993,"production, particularly in conflict areas.",UNGD
RUS,1993,We are in favour of transforming the Nuclear,UNGD
RUS,1993,Non-Proliferation Treaty into a universal agreement of,UNGD
RUS,1993,unlimited duration. The United Nations should also work to,UNGD
RUS,1993,ensure the universality of and strict compliance with the,UNGD
RUS,1993,Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.,UNGD
RUS,1993,"Russia reiterates, from this rostrum of the General",UNGD
RUS,1993,"Assembly, its intention to adhere to the international regime",UNGD
RUS,1993,of non-proliferation of missile technology. In the very near,UNGD
RUS,1993,"future, we intend to take concrete steps to strengthen our",UNGD
RUS,1993,"relevant domestic legislation, going so far as to envisage",UNGD
RUS,1993,criminal prosecution for violations of the rules governing the,UNGD
RUS,1993,export of missile equipment and technology. We call on all,UNGD
RUS,1993,States that possess such technology to join the Missile,UNGD
RUS,1993,Technology Control Regime (MTCR). It is also necessary,UNGD
RUS,1993,to provide for equality of rights and obligations of the,UNGD
RUS,1993,"participants, so as to enable them freely to export peaceful",UNGD
RUS,1993,space technology.,UNGD
RUS,1993,Successful economic reform is one of the guarantees of,UNGD
RUS,1993,peace. This is of particular relevance to the many developing,UNGD
RUS,1993,countries and to the post-communist States. Easier access to,UNGD
RUS,1993,"world markets for countries with transitional economies,",UNGD
RUS,1993,"including Russia, and the lifting of all discriminatory",UNGD
RUS,1993,restrictions is becoming an issue of the highest priority. We,UNGD
RUS,1993,Forty-eighth session - 28 September l993 17,UNGD
RUS,1993,believe that the General Assembly should express its support,UNGD
RUS,1993,for efforts in this direction. We also propose the,UNGD
RUS,1993,establishment of a mechanism to coordinate programmes,UNGD
RUS,1993,carried out by the institutions of the United Nations system,UNGD
RUS,1993,in support of economic reforms in countries in transition.,UNGD
RUS,1993,The strengthening of democracy is the principal,UNGD
RUS,1993,guarantee of security and socio-economic development in the,UNGD
RUS,1993,"world today. This has been true in Europe, Asia, Africa and",UNGD
RUS,1993,"Latin America, although the process is not proceeding easily",UNGD
RUS,1993,and automatically everywhere. Peoples who have risen up,UNGD
RUS,1993,against totalitarianism are threatened by the risk of political,UNGD
RUS,1993,violence and ultra-nationalism.,UNGD
RUS,1993,We categorically reject such an alternative. Russia is,UNGD
RUS,1993,peacefully transforming itself in accordance with the,UNGD
RUS,1993,"fundamental principle of democracy: free elections. In 1991,",UNGD
RUS,1993,the people of Russia elected their country’s first democratic,UNGD
RUS,1993,"President, and they confirmed their confidence in his policies",UNGD
RUS,1993,at the April referendum this year. On the basis of this,UNGD
RUS,1993,"twofold mandate, the President has taken decisive measures",UNGD
RUS,1993,to ensure democratic elections to the Parliament in,UNGD
RUS,1993,"December of this year. Thus, the old totalitarian system of",UNGD
RUS,1993,power will be definitively dismantled and replaced by a new,UNGD
RUS,1993,system of power elected by the people and responsible only,UNGD
RUS,1993,to the people. We invite international observers to monitor,UNGD
RUS,1993,the elections to the Parliament.,UNGD
RUS,1993,"In building a new democratic Russia, we of course must",UNGD
RUS,1993,first of all rely on our own potential. Yet we very much,UNGD
RUS,1993,appreciate the solidarity the democratic community has,UNGD
RUS,1993,shown us. Such solidarity is neither an act of interference,UNGD
RUS,1993,in our domestic affairs nor the whimsical gesture of,UNGD
RUS,1993,romanticists in international politics. It is simply an,UNGD
RUS,1993,expression of the human duty to protect the rights of,UNGD
RUS,1993,individuals in other countries.,UNGD
RUS,1993,Next month will mark the fiftieth anniversary of the,UNGD
RUS,1993,"Moscow Conference when, in the turbulent year of 1943, the",UNGD
RUS,1993,foundation was laid for the establishment of the United,UNGD
RUS,1993,"Nations, which was conceived as an organization of",UNGD
RUS,1993,democratic countries having triumphed over Nazi,UNGD
RUS,1993,"totalitarianism. Half a century later, the success of",UNGD
RUS,1993,democracy in Russia and many other countries has made it,UNGD
RUS,1993,possible for the first time to realize fully the lofty destiny of,UNGD
RUS,1993,the United Nations and to help it become a truly efficient,UNGD
RUS,1993,peacemaking Organization.,UNGD
RUS,1993,"We should not allow political short-sightedness, current",UNGD
RUS,1993,"economic difficulties, egoism and conceit to make us lose",UNGD
RUS,1993,the chance to transform the still fragile post-communist,UNGD
RUS,1993,world into a democratic one. I hope that this session will,UNGD
RUS,1993,move us closer to an understanding of this goal and of the,UNGD
RUS,1993,ways of reaching it in the interests of all States and nations.,UNGD
RUS,1994,At the,UNGD
RUS,1994,"very outset I would like to congratulate you, Mr. Amara",UNGD
RUS,1994,"Essy, on your election to the high post of President of the",UNGD
RUS,1994,General Assembly at its current session. I view this as a,UNGD
RUS,1994,sign of recognition of your country’s authority in the,UNGD
RUS,1994,international community.,UNGD
RUS,1994,The United Nations is approaching its fiftieth,UNGD
RUS,1994,"anniversary, and the entire world has grown older along",UNGD
RUS,1994,with it. What is the world like nowadays? Has it become,UNGD
RUS,1994,"better? Has it become wiser? And, most important, what",UNGD
RUS,1994,will the present generation leave behind to its successors?,UNGD
RUS,1994,"No State, no people can be indifferent to these",UNGD
RUS,1994,questions. Here in the United Nations we must find,UNGD
RUS,1994,answers to them. This is particularly important for,UNGD
RUS,1994,Russia. We are trying to understand what kind of world,UNGD
RUS,1994,"we want to live in, and exactly what kind of world we",UNGD
RUS,1994,should spare no effort to build.,UNGD
RUS,1994,The new Russia was born in 1991 as a democratic,UNGD
RUS,1994,State. Its birth was witnessed by the entire world.,UNGD
RUS,1994,For several years now we have been engaged in a,UNGD
RUS,1994,"tremendous, and painstaking task, the essence of which is",UNGD
RUS,1994,to remove the legacy of totalitarianism and the cold war.,UNGD
RUS,1994,Freedom has come to Russia. The people have,UNGD
RUS,1994,obtained fundamental civil rights long denied them.,UNGD
RUS,1994,Profound economic reform is in progress in Russia. A,UNGD
RUS,1994,"free market economy is being put into effect. Thus, each",UNGD
RUS,1994,of our new success stories reinforces Russian democracy.,UNGD
RUS,1994,Russia has decisively drawn a final line under the,UNGD
RUS,1994,Second World War. Our forces have been withdrawn,UNGD
RUS,1994,"from Germany, Central Europe and the Baltic States. Of",UNGD
RUS,1994,"its own accord, and at great effort, Russia has removed",UNGD
RUS,1994,any threat to the security of other States.,UNGD
RUS,1994,"Furthermore, our country, through its own efforts,",UNGD
RUS,1994,"has promoted the end of confrontation in Europe, setting",UNGD
RUS,1994,"up new security structures there, not only for a select",UNGD
RUS,1994,"number, the chosen but for all. The Conference on",UNGD
RUS,1994,Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) should,UNGD
RUS,1994,become a powerful driving force in that process.,UNGD
RUS,1994,1,UNGD
RUS,1994,,UNGD
RUS,1994,,UNGD
RUS,1994,We expect there to be more understanding on the part,UNGD
RUS,1994,of our partners with regard to the problems of security in,UNGD
RUS,1994,Russia. We count on their ability to overcome the old,UNGD
RUS,1994,"suspicion inherent in a world divided into blocs, suspicion",UNGD
RUS,1994,that is now unjustified.,UNGD
RUS,1994,Russia is undergoing changes and regaining its,UNGD
RUS,1994,"identity, but in every respect it remains a great Power.",UNGD
RUS,1994,Russia is ready for equal cooperation within the framework,UNGD
RUS,1994,"of the international community, which should in turn accept",UNGD
RUS,1994,"an active, open Russia.",UNGD
RUS,1994,We would like nuclear weapons and other kinds of,UNGD
RUS,1994,weapons of mass destruction to cease to exist. Efficient,UNGD
RUS,1994,control over the non-proliferation of the technologies for,UNGD
RUS,1994,their production is imperative.,UNGD
RUS,1994,Russia needs a world without wars and armed conflicts,UNGD
RUS,1994,and without environmental calamities. We favour the,UNGD
RUS,1994,development of international economic ties without,UNGD
RUS,1994,discrimination. Russia stands for a world capable of,UNGD
RUS,1994,"combating terrorism, drug-trafficking and other types of",UNGD
RUS,1994,international crime.,UNGD
RUS,1994,"To make such gigantic changes possible, efforts by all",UNGD
RUS,1994,the Members of the United Nations will be required. There,UNGD
RUS,1994,is no room for either soloists or supernumeraries.,UNGD
RUS,1994,"Naturally, we cannot do without new relations between",UNGD
RUS,1994,the two major nuclear Powers. I am convinced that the,UNGD
RUS,1994,entire world has a vital stake in the establishment of a,UNGD
RUS,1994,strategic partnership between Russia and the United States.,UNGD
RUS,1994,I am ready for a serious and fruitful dialogue with President,UNGD
RUS,1994,"Bill Clinton, who today gave an optimistic forecast of our",UNGD
RUS,1994,interaction.,UNGD
RUS,1994,Russia’s economic and foreign-policy priorities lie in,UNGD
RUS,1994,the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States,UNGD
RUS,1994,"(CIS), the former Republics of the Soviet Union. Russia’s",UNGD
RUS,1994,ties with them are closer than the traditional relations of,UNGD
RUS,1994,"good-neighbourliness; we have, rather, an extraordinary",UNGD
RUS,1994,blood relationship. In virtually all the CIS countries today,UNGD
RUS,1994,there is a growing desire for closer cooperation and a,UNGD
RUS,1994,"genuine, rather than merely proclaimed, integration. Its",UNGD
RUS,1994,foundation will be good will and mutual benefit.,UNGD
RUS,1994,Attempts to use the contradictions between the CIS,UNGD
RUS,1994,States for selfish ends are extremely short-sighted.,UNGD
RUS,1994,Conflicts in a number of CIS countries threaten not only,UNGD
RUS,1994,"the security of our State, but also security at the regional",UNGD
RUS,1994,and global levels.,UNGD
RUS,1994,We are acutely interested in the active participation,UNGD
RUS,1994,of the world community in settling these difficult,UNGD
RUS,1994,"problems. However, the main peace-keeping burden in",UNGD
RUS,1994,the territory of the former Soviet Union sits is being,UNGD
RUS,1994,borne by the Russian Federation.,UNGD
RUS,1994,Our efforts have not been fruitless. A solid truce,UNGD
RUS,1994,has already been established in Moldova. The peace,UNGD
RUS,1994,process in Georgia is developing; hope of stopping the,UNGD
RUS,1994,bloodshed in Nagorny Karabakh is already emerging and,UNGD
RUS,1994,initial agreements on Tajikistan have also been reached.,UNGD
RUS,1994,Everybody knows how difficult life is for millions of,UNGD
RUS,1994,Russians in newly independent States; it is not a time for,UNGD
RUS,1994,"complacency. Once they were in their own home, but",UNGD
RUS,1994,now they are guests - and not always welcome ones.,UNGD
RUS,1994,We cannot remain indifferent to the fate of our,UNGD
RUS,1994,countrymen. I an not referring to special rights or,UNGD
RUS,1994,privileges. But the people in Russia will not understand,UNGD
RUS,1994,if I do not state here and now that the democratic States,UNGD
RUS,1994,have to prove through their actions that guaranteeing,UNGD
RUS,1994,human rights is indeed the cornerstone of their foreign,UNGD
RUS,1994,policy. And in this area neither a selective approach nor,UNGD
RUS,1994,double standards are permissible.,UNGD
RUS,1994,Two years ago the General Assembly adopted the,UNGD
RUS,1994,Declaration on the rights of national minorities. At this,UNGD
RUS,1994,session we propose to come to an agreement on the,UNGD
RUS,1994,principles of that Declaration being embodied in the,UNGD
RUS,1994,legislation of all United Nations Member States.,UNGD
RUS,1994,Russia makes no distinction between settling its,UNGD
RUS,1994,problems and the problems of others. That is why we,UNGD
RUS,1994,particularly highly value what is done within the United,UNGD
RUS,1994,Nations.,UNGD
RUS,1994,The world is now at a crossroads. The tragedy of,UNGD
RUS,1994,the struggle of two opposing blocs is finally over. The,UNGD
RUS,1994,"delicate balance based on power, fear and mutual",UNGD
RUS,1994,intimidation has disappeared for ever.,UNGD
RUS,1994,But the world is still not stable. The changes that,UNGD
RUS,1994,"are taking place entail not only hopes for a better future,",UNGD
RUS,1994,but also profound anxieties.,UNGD
RUS,1994,It is not only Russia that is trying to respond to the,UNGD
RUS,1994,"emerging challenges. To a certain degree, the united",UNGD
RUS,1994,"Germany, Japan, the United States and other countries of",UNGD
RUS,1994,the West face the same problem. The same applies,UNGD
RUS,1994,"equally to many countries in Asia, Africa and Latin",UNGD
RUS,1994,America.,UNGD
RUS,1994,2,UNGD
RUS,1994,,UNGD
RUS,1994,,UNGD
RUS,1994,The fundamental changes in international relations are,UNGD
RUS,1994,accompanied by the emergence of new problems. More,UNGD
RUS,1994,and more countries see strengthening the effectiveness of,UNGD
RUS,1994,"inter-State structures as the solution. At the same time, this",UNGD
RUS,1994,does not always prevent an increase in the activity of those,UNGD
RUS,1994,who hold separatist and nationalist aspirations.,UNGD
RUS,1994,"A veritable floodgate of regional and local conflicts,",UNGD
RUS,1994,"national, tribal and religious enmity and economic, social",UNGD
RUS,1994,and political confrontations has been opened wide. The,UNGD
RUS,1994,bleeding wound in Bosnia has not healed. It is a tragic,UNGD
RUS,1994,paradox that in the wake of the cold war in Europe hotbeds,UNGD
RUS,1994,of war have flared up there anew.,UNGD
RUS,1994,The unprecedented tragedy in Rwanda resounds,UNGD
RUS,1994,painfully in the hearts of all people. This has proved to be,UNGD
RUS,1994,a defeat for us all.,UNGD
RUS,1994,But let us look around. Are there not other parts of,UNGD
RUS,1994,the world where more refined and civilized unlawful actions,UNGD
RUS,1994,are being taken against national and cultural minorities?,UNGD
RUS,1994,Are their rights and their security not threatened? Have,UNGD
RUS,1994,racism and anti-Semitism disappeared? Is there no longer,UNGD
RUS,1994,any discrimination against those who are categorized as,UNGD
RUS,1994,non-indigenous?,UNGD
RUS,1994,When aggressive nationalism is made into State policy,UNGD
RUS,1994,it is a grave danger for all mankind.,UNGD
RUS,1994,These problems are all the more urgent today because,UNGD
RUS,1994,the threat of local conflicts has not waned.,UNGD
RUS,1994,Each of these conflicts could cause a veritable,UNGD
RUS,1994,avalanche of geopolitical changes all over the world.,UNGD
RUS,1994,"The cold war is over, but its material infrastructure -",UNGD
RUS,1994,the mountains of arms and the military-industrial complexes,UNGD
RUS,1994,of the developed countries - still remain. The spread of,UNGD
RUS,1994,nuclear weapons could make them into instruments of,UNGD
RUS,1994,terror. Huge amounts of weapons have been dumped onto,UNGD
RUS,1994,"international markets. Unfortunately, vested interests",UNGD
RUS,1994,frequently prevail over the awareness of the danger implicit,UNGD
RUS,1994,"in this process. In fact, this is nothing but an arms race",UNGD
RUS,1994,that has simply been transferred to the developing countries,UNGD
RUS,1994,through the market.,UNGD
RUS,1994,The worsening ecological crisis and the proliferation,UNGD
RUS,1994,of AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) and other,UNGD
RUS,1994,dangerous diseases are also realities at the close of this,UNGD
RUS,1994,twentieth century.,UNGD
RUS,1994,The lessons of history can be learned only with great,UNGD
RUS,1994,difficulty. Obsession with the idea of supremacy is,UNGD
RUS,1994,extremely dangerous. The pathological failure to accept,UNGD
RUS,1994,something different has time and again resulted in,UNGD
RUS,1994,numerous ethnic and religious problems and conflicts.,UNGD
RUS,1994,The fear of open political territory wind up once again,UNGD
RUS,1994,"with a ""cordon sanitaire"" or ""iron curtain"".",UNGD
RUS,1994,"Let us be honest: equality, partnership, mutual",UNGD
RUS,1994,"benefit and cooperation still remain, to a large extent,",UNGD
RUS,1994,words used to cover State egotism. Such a situation,UNGD
RUS,1994,indicates an urgent need to develop a solid system of,UNGD
RUS,1994,security on the basis of principles and mechanisms of,UNGD
RUS,1994,"cooperation on the part of everyone, and a need for the",UNGD
RUS,1994,reform of international institutions. Such a system should,UNGD
RUS,1994,be in keeping with the new conditions that now prevail,UNGD
RUS,1994,and should function under the auspices of the United,UNGD
RUS,1994,Nations.,UNGD
RUS,1994,As a specific contribution towards the establishment,UNGD
RUS,1994,"of such a system, I would propose the following",UNGD
RUS,1994,measures.,UNGD
RUS,1994,"First, we must speed up the negotiations on the",UNGD
RUS,1994,conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty.,UNGD
RUS,1994,"Russia advocates the signing of this treaty next year,",UNGD
RUS,1994,when we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the United,UNGD
RUS,1994,Nations. We should also give thought to further steps to,UNGD
RUS,1994,limit Russian and American strategic nuclear weapons in,UNGD
RUS,1994,order to make it possible eventually to renounce the,UNGD
RUS,1994,"inherited ""balance of terror"" based on mutual nuclear",UNGD
RUS,1994,deterrence.,UNGD
RUS,1994,"Secondly, we must extend non-proliferation measures",UNGD
RUS,1994,"to cover weapons of mass destruction. Next spring, when",UNGD
RUS,1994,the Conference of the States Parties to the Treaty on the,UNGD
RUS,1994,"Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons takes place, it is",UNGD
RUS,1994,essential to adopt a decision to the effect that the treaty,UNGD
RUS,1994,should be open-ended and of unlimited duration. No one,UNGD
RUS,1994,"has the right to deny this. In this context, we believe that",UNGD
RUS,1994,the non-nuclear-weapon States will need to be given,UNGD
RUS,1994,additional and more precise security assurances. We,UNGD
RUS,1994,propose the holding in the near future of a special,UNGD
RUS,1994,"meeting of the Security Council, at the Foreign Minister",UNGD
RUS,1994,"level, to coordinate and adopt a new resolution on",UNGD
RUS,1994,"so-called ""positive"" security assurances.",UNGD
RUS,1994,"Thirdly, we should launch a multilateral debate on",UNGD
RUS,1994,the issues with regard to the regulation of the,UNGD
RUS,1994,international traffic in weaponry and military equipment.,UNGD
RUS,1994,"Moreover, there is an urgent need for all nuclear-weapon",UNGD
RUS,1994,States to participate in the process of the control and,UNGD
RUS,1994,3,UNGD
RUS,1994,,UNGD
RUS,1994,,UNGD
RUS,1994,limitation of nuclear weapons. We propose that a treaty on,UNGD
RUS,1994,nuclear security and strategic stability be elaborated by the,UNGD
RUS,1994,five nuclear-weapon States. Such a treaty could provide for,UNGD
RUS,1994,cessation of the production of fissionable materials for,UNGD
RUS,1994,"military purposes, for prohibition of the recycling of",UNGD
RUS,1994,fissionable materials for weapons purposes and for further,UNGD
RUS,1994,elimination of nuclear weapons and the reduction of their,UNGD
RUS,1994,means of delivery.,UNGD
RUS,1994,"Fourthly, it would be advisable to open discussions on",UNGD
RUS,1994,regional programmes to strengthen peace and security.,UNGD
RUS,1994,Regional security systems are being formed even now: I,UNGD
RUS,1994,am thinking particularly of the treaty on collective security,UNGD
RUS,1994,between the members of the Commonwealth of Independent,UNGD
RUS,1994,States (CIS) of the former Soviet Union. We believe that,UNGD
RUS,1994,at the present stage that the United Nations could direct its,UNGD
RUS,1994,efforts towards coordinating the process of building up,UNGD
RUS,1994,regional security systems.,UNGD
RUS,1994,"Finally, the experience of recent years demonstrates",UNGD
RUS,1994,that the renunciation of the arms race is a complicated and,UNGD
RUS,1994,highly expensive process. Conversion of the military,UNGD
RUS,1994,industry gives rise to extremely difficult economic and,UNGD
RUS,1994,"social problems that have to be dealt with, particularly as",UNGD
RUS,1994,they relate to the elimination of chemical and,UNGD
RUS,1994,"bacteriological weapons. In this context, it is important to",UNGD
RUS,1994,pool the efforts of the international community. Such,UNGD
RUS,1994,cooperation among States would help to enhance the level,UNGD
RUS,1994,"of mutual trust. In 1996, it might be possible to hold a",UNGD
RUS,1994,"conference, under the auspices of the United Nations, on",UNGD
RUS,1994,international cooperation in the field of conversion.,UNGD
RUS,1994,Implementation of these measures will enable us to,UNGD
RUS,1994,"substantially stabilize the situation in the world. However,",UNGD
RUS,1994,"from the long-term point of view, these measures will not",UNGD
RUS,1994,be sufficient.,UNGD
RUS,1994,The former purely military understanding of the,UNGD
RUS,1994,"concept of ""security"" has today become obsolete. The",UNGD
RUS,1994,range of problems faced by mankind is much wider than it,UNGD
RUS,1994,was. The modern definition of security is inseparable from,UNGD
RUS,1994,the notion of stable development.,UNGD
RUS,1994,The world is urgently in need of a strategy for the,UNGD
RUS,1994,twenty-first century - a strategy of mutual responsibility.,UNGD
RUS,1994,The most important points of reference for such a strategy,UNGD
RUS,1994,could be defined as follows:,UNGD
RUS,1994,"- Stable economic and social development, not",UNGD
RUS,1994,"only for individual regions and States but,",UNGD
RUS,1994,"indeed, for the entire planet as a single entity.",UNGD
RUS,1994,People themselves must assume the,UNGD
RUS,1994,responsibility of carrying out this immense task;,UNGD
RUS,1994,- The renunciation of diktat by the powerful,UNGD
RUS,1994,"vis-à-vis the weak. Any country, whether large",UNGD
RUS,1994,"or small, should be aware of its responsibility",UNGD
RUS,1994,for the maintenance of order based on law and,UNGD
RUS,1994,morality;,UNGD
RUS,1994,"- The unconditional recognition of human rights,",UNGD
RUS,1994,including the rights of national minorities. In,UNGD
RUS,1994,"view of the great diversity of cultures,",UNGD
RUS,1994,traditions and the historical experience of,UNGD
RUS,1994,"countries and peoples, fundamental human",UNGD
RUS,1994,rights are a universal value and we cannot,UNGD
RUS,1994,permit them to be devalued;,UNGD
RUS,1994,- Strengthening the ecological security of,UNGD
RUS,1994,mankind. The world is now facing a most,UNGD
RUS,1994,serious crisis because of the deficit of,UNGD
RUS,1994,"resources, deterioration of the natural",UNGD
RUS,1994,"environment, and many other negative trends.",UNGD
RUS,1994,Common sense and the instinct for survival tell,UNGD
RUS,1994,us to stop exploiting our depleting resources to,UNGD
RUS,1994,"the detriment of nature, society and mankind.",UNGD
RUS,1994,Russia supports the programme on Global,UNGD
RUS,1994,education and observation to preserve the,UNGD
RUS,1994,"environment. Moreover, this programme is",UNGD
RUS,1994,entirely consistent with the strategy of shared,UNGD
RUS,1994,responsibility. We intend to participate,UNGD
RUS,1994,actively in its implementation.,UNGD
RUS,1994,"At the same time, I should like to emphasize that",UNGD
RUS,1994,"only a profound understanding, on the part of each",UNGD
RUS,1994,"participant in international cooperation, of his or her",UNGD
RUS,1994,individual responsibility can engender a common sense of,UNGD
RUS,1994,responsibility for the world situation.,UNGD
RUS,1994,To paraphrase a well known expression we could,UNGD
RUS,1994,say that the United Nations is a good idea whose time has,UNGD
RUS,1994,finally come. I should like in particular to note the great,UNGD
RUS,1994,personal contribution of the United Nations Secretary-,UNGD
RUS,1994,"General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, to the cause of",UNGD
RUS,1994,advocating peace and settling regional conflicts.,UNGD
RUS,1994,If the United Nations is to achieve maximum,UNGD
RUS,1994,"effectiveness in the twenty-first century, it must undergo",UNGD
RUS,1994,a well-thought-out reform.,UNGD
RUS,1994,"Obviously, changes will be required both at",UNGD
RUS,1994,Headquarters and in the functioning of the specialized,UNGD
RUS,1994,"agencies. Also, it will be impossible to avoid changes in",UNGD
RUS,1994,4,UNGD
RUS,1994,,UNGD
RUS,1994,,UNGD
RUS,1994,"the Security Council, which should remain sufficiently",UNGD
RUS,1994,compact and an effective functioning body. This is,UNGD
RUS,1994,"especially important because, according to the Charter, the",UNGD
RUS,1994,Security Council bears primary responsibility for supporting,UNGD
RUS,1994,and maintaining world peace and security.,UNGD
RUS,1994,"We have to strike a new balance of law, morality and",UNGD
RUS,1994,force in world politics. The United Nations could play a,UNGD
RUS,1994,decisive role in these efforts in accordance with the Charter.,UNGD
RUS,1994,"Russia stands ready, as provided in Article 43 of the",UNGD
RUS,1994,"Charter, to enter into an agreement with the Security",UNGD
RUS,1994,Council to make available national military contingents for,UNGD
RUS,1994,United Nations operations. If a sufficient number of other,UNGD
RUS,1994,"States follows this lead, then it could be possible to go",UNGD
RUS,1994,ahead with the realization of the concept of United Nations,UNGD
RUS,1994,stand-by forces.,UNGD
RUS,1994,The Military Staff Committee has already been,UNGD
RUS,1994,formally in existence for several decades. According to the,UNGD
RUS,1994,"Charter its function is ""to advise and assist the Security",UNGD
RUS,1994,Council on all questions relating to the Security Council’s,UNGD
RUS,1994,"military requirements"". Let them finally do just that.",UNGD
RUS,1994,The pertinent task now will be to work out a strategy,UNGD
RUS,1994,"of peace-keeping, conflict and crisis prevention and, if",UNGD
RUS,1994,"necessary, operations on peace enforcement.",UNGD
RUS,1994,"Through specific actions, Russia has shown support",UNGD
RUS,1994,for United Nations efforts aimed at setting up efficient,UNGD
RUS,1994,mechanisms of response to humanitarian emergencies. We,UNGD
RUS,1994,stand ready to cooperate with all countries anxious to,UNGD
RUS,1994,reinforce the capability of the world community to produce,UNGD
RUS,1994,a rapid humanitarian response.,UNGD
RUS,1994,Because the problems we are increasingly,UNGD
RUS,1994,"encountering are multifaceted, they require adequate",UNGD
RUS,1994,solutions. The question is not about who should enjoy,UNGD
RUS,1994,"more rights - the United Nations, the regional structures or",UNGD
RUS,1994,States. The future world system can be truly durable only,UNGD
RUS,1994,if it is possible to find efficient and effective mechanisms,UNGD
RUS,1994,"to address problems at all levels - national, regional and",UNGD
RUS,1994,global. Sharing responsibility will make it possible for the,UNGD
RUS,1994,United Nations to remain flexible and a pragmatic and,UNGD
RUS,1994,effective structure and enable it to focus its efforts on the,UNGD
RUS,1994,solution of the genuinely key problems faced by mankind.,UNGD
RUS,1994,Russia believes that these are all fundamental issues,UNGD
RUS,1994,that have a direct bearing on the fate of the world,UNGD
RUS,1994,community. Both the authority of the United Nations and,UNGD
RUS,1994,the future of world politics as a whole will depend on the,UNGD
RUS,1994,way these issues are dealt with.,UNGD
RUS,1994,"People have always sought stability, happiness and",UNGD
RUS,1994,prosperity. But history provides evidence of the fact that,UNGD
RUS,1994,these goals cannot be achieved with the help of brute,UNGD
RUS,1994,force alone. Once again we become acutely aware of this,UNGD
RUS,1994,fact now that we are approaching a sacred date for,UNGD
RUS,1994,mankind: the fiftieth anniversary of the end of the,UNGD
RUS,1994,Second World War and the restoration of peace.,UNGD
RUS,1994,Let us remember with gratitude those who gave their,UNGD
RUS,1994,lives for this great victory. Let 1995 become the,UNGD
RUS,1994,universal year of commemoration of the victims of the,UNGD
RUS,1994,Second World War.,UNGD
RUS,1994,For the sake of those living and those who have not,UNGD
RUS,1994,"yet been born, we must preserve peace and establish",UNGD
RUS,1994,stability on our planet. Mankind should finally feel that,UNGD
RUS,1994,"it is at home, a home which is both kind and reliable.",UNGD
RUS,1994,Our civilization has always been varied. It is,UNGD
RUS,1994,"precisely in the variety of cultures, traditions and values",UNGD
RUS,1994,that the possibility of development is basically found.,UNGD
RUS,1994,"At this time, we have reached a stage when different",UNGD
RUS,1994,interests and aspirations of peoples can be achieved only,UNGD
RUS,1994,through cooperation among them.,UNGD
RUS,1994,The world community should make every possible,UNGD
RUS,1994,effort to ensure that its policies are embodied in the new,UNGD
RUS,1994,"thinking about the influence of States, national pride and",UNGD
RUS,1994,patriotism.,UNGD
RUS,1994,The United Nations is a child of the world. Fifty,UNGD
RUS,1994,"years ago when the Second World War was in progress,",UNGD
RUS,1994,it became abundantly clear that the future of mankind is,UNGD
RUS,1994,to be found in the realm of cooperation and tolerance,UNGD
RUS,1994,rather than aggression and hatred.,UNGD
RUS,1994,Cooperation and tolerance are prerequisites for the,UNGD
RUS,1994,next century.,UNGD
RUS,1994,This is the most important condition for there to be,UNGD
RUS,1994,a worthy future for our planet.,UNGD
RUS,1994,This is a unique opportunity that has been given to,UNGD
RUS,1994,the human race.,UNGD
RUS,1994,"I believe that the United Nations, in fulfilment of its",UNGD
RUS,1994,"general responsibility, will not allow us to pass it up, and",UNGD
RUS,1994,I hope that the great dream of peace to which all peoples,UNGD
RUS,1994,and States aspire to will take its due place in the life of,UNGD
RUS,1994,our planet.,UNGD
RUS,1995,"First of all, allow me to congratulate my",UNGD
RUS,1995,"colleague, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Portugal,",UNGD
RUS,1995,"Professor Diogo Freitas Do Amaral, on the occasion of",UNGD
RUS,1995,his election to the high post of the President of the,UNGD
RUS,1995,General Assembly.,UNGD
RUS,1995,Each of the 50 sessions of the General Assembly has,UNGD
RUS,1995,been a step for the international community on a difficult,UNGD
RUS,1995,"road in search of peace within itself, for the strengthening",UNGD
RUS,1995,of the indispensable role of the United Nations. The,UNGD
RUS,1995,current session will be marked as the anniversary session,UNGD
RUS,1995,by the addresses to be made by the Heads of State and,UNGD
RUS,1995,Government in late October. Russia’s views on the,UNGD
RUS,1995,prospects and difficulties of establishing partnership in a,UNGD
RUS,1995,multi-polar and interdependent world — and it is with,UNGD
RUS,1995,equal partnership that we link our national and state,UNGD
RUS,1995,interests — will be stated by the Head of the Russian,UNGD
RUS,1995,"State, President Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin.",UNGD
RUS,1995,If half a century of experience of the United Nations,UNGD
RUS,1995,"teaches us anything, it teaches us first of all that only the",UNGD
RUS,1995,"equality of States and respect for the diversity of cultures,",UNGD
RUS,1995,religions and national traditions can serve as the basis for,UNGD
RUS,1995,security and prosperity in the modern world. But the,UNGD
RUS,1995,formula “unity in diversity” also presupposes everyone’s,UNGD
RUS,1995,compliance with fundamental principles of international,UNGD
RUS,1995,"law and order, respect for human rights and the",UNGD
RUS,1995,6,UNGD
RUS,1995,,UNGD
RUS,1995,,UNGD
RUS,1995,promotion of economic progress. This is the essence of the,UNGD
RUS,1995,"United Nations Charter, which identifies both common",UNGD
RUS,1995,ideals and goals and equal rights and obligations for all,UNGD
RUS,1995,States without “double standards”.,UNGD
RUS,1995,They say that generals always prepare for the last war.,UNGD
RUS,1995,Politicians and diplomats have no right to prepare for the,UNGD
RUS,1995,"last peace. On the contrary, it is necessary to avoid slipping",UNGD
RUS,1995,back into a bloc mentality and dividing countries into,UNGD
RUS,1995,"“friends and foes”, whether in politics or in economics.",UNGD
RUS,1995,We can indeed make the next 50 years an era of the,UNGD
RUS,1995,United Nations if we accept as its basis the indivisibility of,UNGD
RUS,1995,international security and sustainable social and economic,UNGD
RUS,1995,development for all.,UNGD
RUS,1995,This question becomes more and more acute against,UNGD
RUS,1995,the background of humanitarian disasters in Africa and,UNGD
RUS,1995,"other regions of the “third world”, and the social price of",UNGD
RUS,1995,the initial stage of reforms in the post-socialist countries.,UNGD
RUS,1995,No one will be able to hide from global problems behind,UNGD
RUS,1995,dividing lines of national egotism and economic,UNGD
RUS,1995,"discrimination, or even expanding military alliances. Such",UNGD
RUS,1995,"things will not rein in, but rather spur on the spread of",UNGD
RUS,1995,"international terrorism and drugs, and whip up the flames",UNGD
RUS,1995,of local conflicts and the arms race.,UNGD
RUS,1995,One of the principles of the “Agenda for,UNGD
RUS,1995,Development” which is being formulated now should be the,UNGD
RUS,1995,early elimination of the remaining discriminatory,UNGD
RUS,1995,"restrictions in the world economy, trade and technology",UNGD
RUS,1995,"transfer. In particular, Russia, which is successfully",UNGD
RUS,1995,"implementing unparalleled reforms, should be recognized as",UNGD
RUS,1995,an equal trade and economic partner with an economy in,UNGD
RUS,1995,transition.,UNGD
RUS,1995,Such a strategy should also provide for the promotion,UNGD
RUS,1995,of the economic rehabilitation of countries and regions,UNGD
RUS,1995,"affected by armed conflicts. The United Nations, its",UNGD
RUS,1995,specialized agencies and Member States should immediately,UNGD
RUS,1995,begin to address directly the problem of the economic,UNGD
RUS,1995,rehabilitation of Bosnia and the former Yugoslavia as a,UNGD
RUS,1995,"whole, whose peoples have suffered from war and",UNGD
RUS,1995,economic sanctions that have been in effect for too long.,UNGD
RUS,1995,"Russia is ready to take an active part in these efforts, and",UNGD
RUS,1995,we do and will continue to contribute substantially to a,UNGD
RUS,1995,political settlement. The real chances for such a settlement,UNGD
RUS,1995,should not be sacrificed to power or unilateral approaches.,UNGD
RUS,1995,The international community should make equally,UNGD
RUS,1995,great efforts to achieve progress in all aspects of the peace,UNGD
RUS,1995,process in the Middle East and the post-conflict,UNGD
RUS,1995,rehabilitation of all States of that region. We congratulate,UNGD
RUS,1995,Israel and the Palestinians on the occasion of their,UNGD
RUS,1995,"reaching an agreement in Taba, whose official signing",UNGD
RUS,1995,ceremony will take place on 28 September next in,UNGD
RUS,1995,Washington under the chairmanship of President Clinton.,UNGD
RUS,1995,We intend to continue our joint efforts with the United,UNGD
RUS,1995,States and to make our contribution to the coming,UNGD
RUS,1995,Amman summit conference.,UNGD
RUS,1995,Europe needs a new model of general and,UNGD
RUS,1995,"comprehensive security, without double standards or",UNGD
RUS,1995,dividing lines.,UNGD
RUS,1995,International dialogue on this issue is already under,UNGD
RUS,1995,way. I believe that the active involvement of the United,UNGD
RUS,1995,Nations and its specialized agencies is necessary to the,UNGD
RUS,1995,efforts aimed at the development of this model.,UNGD
RUS,1995,"Incidentally, the General Assembly was born in the Old",UNGD
RUS,1995,World.,UNGD
RUS,1995,A new approach is required to disarmament issues in,UNGD
RUS,1995,Europe. On the basis of the implementation of the,UNGD
RUS,1995,Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty (certainly,UNGD
RUS,1995,taking into account new realities) as early as next spring,UNGD
RUS,1995,we should arrive at new major agreements based on the,UNGD
RUS,1995,unity of the vital security interests of the peoples of the,UNGD
RUS,1995,continent instead of the bloc logic of the past.,UNGD
RUS,1995,Our proposal to all nuclear-weapon States to,UNGD
RUS,1995,elaborate a treaty on nuclear safety and strategic stability,UNGD
RUS,1995,has become even more timely.,UNGD
RUS,1995,The indefinite extension of the Non-Proliferation,UNGD
RUS,1995,Treaty establishes favourable conditions for this. Our,UNGD
RUS,1995,common task is to create the necessary political,UNGD
RUS,1995,conditions for those States that have not already done so,UNGD
RUS,1995,to accede to it as non-nuclear States. We consider it,UNGD
RUS,1995,"necessary, as a matter of priority, to conclude as soon as",UNGD
RUS,1995,"possible, but not later than 1996, work on the",UNGD
RUS,1995,"comprehensive test-ban treaty. From this rostrum, Russia",UNGD
RUS,1995,calls for a universal and permanent moratorium on,UNGD
RUS,1995,nuclear tests.,UNGD
RUS,1995,The summit of the “Political Eight” on nuclear,UNGD
RUS,1995,"safety, which is to be held next spring in Moscow at the",UNGD
RUS,1995,initiative of the President of Russia and which was,UNGD
RUS,1995,"approved in Halifax, will make a major contribution to",UNGD
RUS,1995,global stability.,UNGD
RUS,1995,We would like the United Nations to take urgent,UNGD
RUS,1995,measures on the prevention of illicit trafficking in light,UNGD
RUS,1995,firearms and the proliferation of anti-personnel mines. It,UNGD
RUS,1995,7,UNGD
RUS,1995,,UNGD
RUS,1995,,UNGD
RUS,1995,is these “light” firearms that have led to enormous human,UNGD
RUS,1995,"losses in Rwanda and Angola, Liberia and Bosnia,",UNGD
RUS,1995,Tajikistan and Abkhazia. Russia has already introduced a,UNGD
RUS,1995,moratorium on the export of the most dangerous types of,UNGD
RUS,1995,anti-personnel mines. We urge other States to follow our,UNGD
RUS,1995,example.,UNGD
RUS,1995,This issue should be seriously considered in the United,UNGD
RUS,1995,Nations Disarmament Commission. While supporting the,UNGD
RUS,1995,"activities of the Commission, we believe that it should",UNGD
RUS,1995,adopt a new agenda corresponding to the current scale of,UNGD
RUS,1995,cooperation in the area of security and to new threats and,UNGD
RUS,1995,challenges in this field.,UNGD
RUS,1995,The problem of global adherence to a single standard,UNGD
RUS,1995,in the area of human rights and basic democratic,UNGD
RUS,1995,"institutions is very acute. Russia, approaching free,",UNGD
RUS,1995,"multipartite parliamentary and presidential elections, is",UNGD
RUS,1995,making its own contribution to the establishment of these,UNGD
RUS,1995,very standards. We invite observers from foreign States and,UNGD
RUS,1995,international organizations to attend the forthcoming,UNGD
RUS,1995,elections.,UNGD
RUS,1995,It was not so long ago that dozens of agenda items of,UNGD
RUS,1995,the General Assembly were devoted to the struggle against,UNGD
RUS,1995,apartheid. Now it seems unbelievable that this problem has,UNGD
RUS,1995,"been solved, owing to a large extent, to the efforts of the",UNGD
RUS,1995,United Nations. I sincerely welcome the accomplishments,UNGD
RUS,1995,"of the people and the Government of South Africa, headed",UNGD
RUS,1995,"by Nelson Mandela, in the democratization and creation of",UNGD
RUS,1995,"a free, multiracial society.",UNGD
RUS,1995,But did we manage to overcome the danger of,UNGD
RUS,1995,"violence arising through fascism, racism, and political and",UNGD
RUS,1995,"religious extremism? Alas, the answer is far from",UNGD
RUS,1995,reassuring. That is why the international community has no,UNGD
RUS,1995,right to abandon its efforts in this direction and must not,UNGD
RUS,1995,tolerate the emergence of double standards.,UNGD
RUS,1995,The signing of the CIS conventions on human rights,UNGD

RUS,1995,"approach to human rights can become a norm of life for,",UNGD
RUS,1995,"among others, 25 million of our compatriots in some",UNGD
RUS,1995,countries of the Commonwealth and the Baltic States. A,UNGD
RUS,1995,double standard here is unacceptable.,UNGD
RUS,1995,Russia is interested in the adoption at this session of,UNGD
RUS,1995,"decisions on such issues as the struggle against racism, all",UNGD
RUS,1995,"forms of xenophobia and aggressive nationalism, ensuring",UNGD
RUS,1995,the rights of minorities and the promotion of democracy,UNGD
RUS,1995,and the rule of law in countries in transition. The United,UNGD
RUS,1995,Nations should further pursue its policy of qualitative,UNGD

RUS,1995,"machinery, primarily by strengthening its control and",UNGD
RUS,1995,preventive functions and enhancing its focus on specific,UNGD

RUS,1995,8,UNGD
RUS,1995,,UNGD
RUS,1995,,UNGD
RUS,1995,support of our collective efforts sometimes unfortunately,UNGD
RUS,1995,"reminds us of a saying: “Too little, too late”. Russia,",UNGD
RUS,1995,"together with its CIS partners, expects the United Nations",UNGD
RUS,1995,to make a radical change in its attitude towards peace-,UNGD
RUS,1995,making problems in our part of the world.,UNGD
RUS,1995,During the 50 years of the existence of the United,UNGD
RUS,1995,"Nations, sanctions have been an instrument that the",UNGD
RUS,1995,Organization has used to deal with the instigators of,UNGD
RUS,1995,"conflicts. Now, the time has come to give this instrument",UNGD
RUS,1995,a more selective and precise nature. The principal criteria,UNGD
RUS,1995,"in this regard are: distinct objectives underlying sanctions,",UNGD
RUS,1995,"advanced coordination of conditions, and mechanisms for",UNGD
RUS,1995,lifting them once the objectives are attained.,UNGD
RUS,1995,As a newly elected member of the Executive Council,UNGD
RUS,1995,of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for,UNGD
RUS,1995,"Refugees, Russia intends to make an essential contribution",UNGD
RUS,1995,"to overcoming a new global crisis, namely the tragedy of",UNGD
RUS,1995,"millions of refugees. To this end, we intend to seek",UNGD
RUS,1995,practical results from the international conference on,UNGD
RUS,1995,refugees and migrants within the post-Soviet space.,UNGD
RUS,1995,At this session the General Assembly should give new,UNGD
RUS,1995,impetus to collective efforts by the international community,UNGD
RUS,1995,"in combating crime, illicit drug-trafficking and terrorism.",UNGD
RUS,1995,"The explosions in Oklahoma and Paris, the taking of",UNGD

RUS,1995,"Whatever agenda item we consider, we are convinced",UNGD
RUS,1995,time and again that the answers are to be found only on the,UNGD
RUS,1995,basis of a single standard: respect for the United Nations,UNGD
RUS,1995,Charter and for the purposes and principles of the United,UNGD
RUS,1995,Nations that have withstood the severe tests of the past five,UNGD
RUS,1995,decades and are lighting the way into the twenty-first,UNGD
RUS,1995,century.,UNGD
RUS,1996,The agenda of the General Assembly at,UNGD
RUS,1996,the current session reflects all the complexity of the stage,UNGD
RUS,1996,"mankind is now going through, the essence of which is",UNGD
RUS,1996,"the transition from bloc confrontation to multipolarity,",UNGD
RUS,1996,economic interdependence and the democratization of,UNGD
RUS,1996,international relations.,UNGD
RUS,1996,I would like to emphasize that during the past year,UNGD
RUS,1996,Russia made its contribution to the consolidation of this,UNGD
RUS,1996,"very trend. At the domestic level, this means an",UNGD
RUS,1996,uncompromising continuation of the process of reforming,UNGD
RUS,1996,society. The results of the recent presidential elections in,UNGD
RUS,1996,our country have convincingly proved that Russia has,UNGD
RUS,1996,decisively embarked on the road to the future. The,UNGD
RUS,1996,majority of Russians voted for the continuation of,UNGD
RUS,1996,"economic reform, for a State of law and for a policy of",UNGD
RUS,1996,openness and cooperation.,UNGD
RUS,1996,In our relations with the other Commonwealth of,UNGD
RUS,1996,"Independent States (CIS) countries, we resolutely oppose",UNGD
RUS,1996,"both the idea of restoring the Soviet Union, an idea based",UNGD
RUS,1996,on the denial of the sovereignty of the Commonwealth,UNGD
RUS,1996,"States, and narrow-minded national isolationism. We",UNGD
RUS,1996,stand for the voluntary integration and unification of the,UNGD
RUS,1996,13,UNGD
RUS,1996,,UNGD
RUS,1996,,UNGD
RUS,1996,members of the Commonwealth and hold that it should not,UNGD
RUS,1996,"be isolated from the rest of the world. We wish to ensure,",UNGD
RUS,1996,"and we shall ensure, that the CIS will become an important",UNGD
RUS,1996,centre of world economic development and international,UNGD
RUS,1996,stability.,UNGD
RUS,1996,"On a wider international plane, Russia is pursuing a",UNGD
RUS,1996,policy aimed at establishing a new world order firmly based,UNGD
RUS,1996,"on the equality of all States, justice and universal security.",UNGD
RUS,1996,"However, the establishment of such a world order is a slow",UNGD
RUS,1996,"process, influenced by both objective and subjective factors.",UNGD
RUS,1996,It is only natural that the end of the cold war provided a,UNGD
RUS,1996,starting point for the transition to achieving a stable and,UNGD
RUS,1996,predictable peace at the global level.,UNGD
RUS,1996,But zones of regional conflict have expanded,UNGD
RUS,1996,drastically. The upsurge of terrorism has caused universal,UNGD
RUS,1996,"shock, and the threat of proliferation of weapons of mass",UNGD
RUS,1996,"destruction is emerging. The rejection of ideological,",UNGD
RUS,1996,"military-force confrontation, brought about by the end of",UNGD
RUS,1996,"the cold war, clearly proved insufficient to neutralize all",UNGD
RUS,1996,these dangers and risks.,UNGD
RUS,1996,"Let us confess, at least to ourselves, that we will not",UNGD
RUS,1996,"succeed here unless, first and foremost, we overcome the",UNGD
RUS,1996,"inertia of the political mentality. Unfortunately, the",UNGD
RUS,1996,stereotypes that took root in the minds of several,UNGD
RUS,1996,generations of statesmen during the 40 years of the cold,UNGD
RUS,1996,war have not yet disappeared along with the dismantling of,UNGD
RUS,1996,strategic missiles and the destruction of thousands of tanks.,UNGD
RUS,1996,"In this connection, I would like to single out three",UNGD
RUS,1996,conditions for the transformation of international relations,UNGD
RUS,1996,during the post-cold-war period.,UNGD
RUS,1996,"First, we should see to it that the old fronts of bloc",UNGD
RUS,1996,confrontation are not replaced with new lines of division.,UNGD
RUS,1996,That is precisely why we accept neither the idea of the,UNGD
RUS,1996,expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,UNGD
RUS,1996,(NATO) military infrastructure to the area of the now,UNGD
RUS,1996,defunct Warsaw Treaty nor the efforts to make that alliance,UNGD
RUS,1996,the axis of a new European system. The enormous,UNGD
RUS,1996,possibilities for economic cooperation and the spiritual,UNGD
RUS,1996,enrichment of all the peoples of the continent can be,UNGD
RUS,1996,realized only through the creation of a genuinely,UNGD
RUS,1996,all-European system of international relations. The,UNGD
RUS,1996,Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,UNGD
RUS,1996,(OSCE) Lisbon summit must be an important stage in the,UNGD
RUS,1996,construction of such a Europe.,UNGD
RUS,1996,It is important to stress in general that the logic of a,UNGD
RUS,1996,multipolar world in the twenty-first century should differ,UNGD
RUS,1996,qualitatively from the schemes outlined by Metternich and,UNGD
RUS,1996,Bismarck. The way towards the establishment of a system,UNGD
RUS,1996,of comprehensive security is through learning the skills of,UNGD
RUS,1996,"equal partnership between the various “poles”, rather than",UNGD
RUS,1996,through the revival of reflexes of rivalry and of balance,UNGD
RUS,1996,of power.,UNGD
RUS,1996,The threat of new lines of division is appearing not,UNGD
RUS,1996,"only in Europe, but elsewhere. The understandable",UNGD
RUS,1996,intolerance of the extremism of certain Islamic groups and,UNGD
RUS,1996,factions must not develop into a categorization of the,UNGD
RUS,1996,Muslim world at large as an enemy of modern,UNGD
RUS,1996,civilization. This is probably one of the pressing,UNGD
RUS,1996,requirements of our day.,UNGD
RUS,1996,Russia advocates resolute opposition to extremist and,UNGD
RUS,1996,terrorist forces. They are especially dangerous when they,UNGD
RUS,1996,"enjoy State support, and no effort should be spared to",UNGD
RUS,1996,prevent any State from rendering such support. This,UNGD
RUS,1996,cannot be justified. I believe it is time a universal,UNGD
RUS,1996,"convention, covering all States without exception, were",UNGD
RUS,1996,"elaborated within the United Nations, denying political",UNGD
RUS,1996,asylum anywhere to persons engaged in terrorist,UNGD
RUS,1996,"activities. However, no sanctions should be used as a",UNGD
RUS,1996,means to punish peoples or as an instrument to overthrow,UNGD
RUS,1996,Governments. It is far more effective to offer prospects,UNGD
RUS,1996,for a better future to those who renounce extremism and,UNGD
RUS,1996,accept the norms of conduct by the world community.,UNGD
RUS,1996,The second condition for achieving a durable peace,UNGD
RUS,1996,is the emancipation from a mentality based on concepts,UNGD
RUS,1996,of leaders and followers. Such a mentality is fuelled by,UNGD
RUS,1996,illusions that some countries emerged from the cold war,UNGD
RUS,1996,"as victors, and others as the vanquished. But this is not",UNGD
RUS,1996,the case. Peoples on both sides of the Iron Curtain jointly,UNGD
RUS,1996,strove to rid themselves of the policy of confrontation.,UNGD
RUS,1996,"Meanwhile, the mentality based on leaders and followers",UNGD
RUS,1996,paves the way directly towards the establishment of a,UNGD
RUS,1996,unipolar world. Such a world-order model is unacceptable,UNGD
RUS,1996,today to the overwhelming majority of the international,UNGD
RUS,1996,community.,UNGD
RUS,1996,"Finally, the third condition for the successful",UNGD
RUS,1996,movement towards stable peace lies in the coordinated,UNGD
RUS,1996,"activities of the international community. Today, one of",UNGD
RUS,1996,the most important tasks is the settlement of regional and,UNGD
RUS,1996,"local conflicts. In this regard, significant progress has",UNGD
RUS,1996,been achieved recently. Peace agreements are being,UNGD
RUS,1996,implemented in Bosnia. Initial important agreements have,UNGD
RUS,1996,been achieved for a durable peace in the Middle East. We,UNGD
RUS,1996,"have managed to secure ceasefires in Transdniester,",UNGD
RUS,1996,"Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Nagorny Karabakh. The",UNGD
RUS,1996,situation has improved somewhat in the conflict zones on,UNGD
RUS,1996,14,UNGD
RUS,1996,,UNGD
RUS,1996,,UNGD
RUS,1996,the African continent and in Latin America. But as yet no,UNGD
RUS,1996,breakthrough to a durable peace has been achieved in any,UNGD
RUS,1996,of these hotbeds of tension.,UNGD
RUS,1996,The future of the Middle East is a cause for grave,UNGD
RUS,1996,concern. Russia — one of the sponsors of the peace,UNGD
RUS,1996,process — cannot accept the sacrifice to tactical,UNGD
RUS,1996,considerations and internal political manoeuvres of the first,UNGD
RUS,1996,"fruits of the peace negotiations, which were won at such a",UNGD
RUS,1996,great cost. The implementation of the Agreements reached,UNGD
RUS,1996,is the only realistic basis for maintaining the peace process.,UNGD
RUS,1996,The only possible way forward is to advance through,UNGD
RUS,1996,"negotiation on the basis of the principle of “land for peace”,",UNGD
RUS,1996,"Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), as",UNGD
RUS,1996,"well as resolution 425 (1978), which deals with Lebanon.",UNGD
RUS,1996,It should be clear that the danger of reverting to,UNGD
RUS,1996,confrontation becomes greater as the artificial pause in the,UNGD
RUS,1996,"peace process continues. When negotiators are silent, lethal",UNGD
RUS,1996,weapons begin to awake.,UNGD
RUS,1996,We appreciate the peacemaking efforts of the United,UNGD
RUS,1996,"States of America, the European Union, France, Egypt and",UNGD
RUS,1996,other members of the international community and we,UNGD
RUS,1996,support an even closer partnership in peacemaking. That is,UNGD
RUS,1996,the most effective way to promote peace-building in the,UNGD
RUS,1996,Middle East.,UNGD
RUS,1996,The Bosnian settlement has entered a new and crucial,UNGD
RUS,1996,stage since the elections of 14 September. The prospects for,UNGD
RUS,1996,"a lasting peace have become greater, but the risk of slipping",UNGD
RUS,1996,into a new spiral of hostility and confrontation remains. I,UNGD
RUS,1996,call upon all the Bosnian parties to take full advantage of,UNGD
RUS,1996,the chance for peace created by the international,UNGD
RUS,1996,"community. At the same time, the United Nations, the",UNGD
RUS,1996,"OSCE, members of the Contact Group and the High",UNGD
RUS,1996,Representative should immediately take a just and balanced,UNGD
RUS,1996,approach to resolving outstanding problems. Assistance for,UNGD
RUS,1996,the social and economic reconstruction of Bosnia and,UNGD
RUS,1996,Herzegovina should be intensified considerably and,UNGD
RUS,1996,conditions created for the return of refugees.,UNGD
RUS,1996,The time has also come to look beyond the horizon of,UNGD
RUS,1996,the Paris agreements. There would seem to be a need for a,UNGD
RUS,1996,large-scale and prolonged civilian peacemaking operation in,UNGD
RUS,1996,which the United Nations and its specialized agencies will,UNGD
RUS,1996,play an important role. The international military and police,UNGD
RUS,1996,"presence, to which Russia contributes, should remain a",UNGD
RUS,1996,factor in the peace process for a given period after,UNGD
RUS,1996,December 1996.,UNGD
RUS,1996,The lifting of sanctions against the Federal Republic,UNGD
RUS,1996,of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and the Bosnian,UNGD
RUS,1996,Serbs is an indispensable condition for a successful peace,UNGD
RUS,1996,"in the former Yugoslavia. I hope that, in the near future,",UNGD
RUS,1996,"a Yugoslav delegation will take its place in this Hall, as",UNGD
RUS,1996,it has at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in,UNGD
RUS,1996,Europe.,UNGD
RUS,1996,"The programme of disarmament, security and",UNGD
RUS,1996,stability for the twenty-first century should become one of,UNGD
RUS,1996,the major axes of transition period strategy. The adoption,UNGD
RUS,1996,of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty is one,UNGD
RUS,1996,huge step in this direction. Russia has just signed the,UNGD
RUS,1996,Treaty and we believe that it is of fundamental,UNGD
RUS,1996,importance for all countries with nuclear capability to,UNGD
RUS,1996,"accede to it. However, it should clearly be understood that",UNGD
RUS,1996,testing by any country of a nuclear explosive device,UNGD
RUS,1996,before the Treaty enters into force will radically change,UNGD
RUS,1996,the international situation and greatly prejudice the Treaty,UNGD
RUS,1996,"itself, and may compel many countries to revise their",UNGD
RUS,1996,attitude to it.,UNGD
RUS,1996,I should like to draw the attention of the Treaty’s,UNGD
RUS,1996,opponents to the fact that it will not only contribute to the,UNGD
RUS,1996,"promotion of nuclear non-proliferation, but will",UNGD
RUS,1996,objectively stimulate a gradual transition to nuclear,UNGD
RUS,1996,disarmament on a multilateral basis. That is the purpose,UNGD
RUS,1996,of President Yeltsin’s proposal to conclude a treaty on,UNGD
RUS,1996,nuclear security and stability with the participation of all,UNGD
RUS,1996,the nuclear Powers. We invite interested States to begin,UNGD
RUS,1996,exchanging views on the issue. Our suggestion that,UNGD
RUS,1996,nuclear arsenals be located only on the territories of the,UNGD
RUS,1996,nuclear Powers in question remains current.,UNGD
RUS,1996,The strengthening of the non-proliferation regime for,UNGD
RUS,1996,weapons of mass destruction depends directly upon,UNGD
RUS,1996,reliable prevention of the illicit traffic in fissile materials.,UNGD
RUS,1996,The Moscow Summit of the Eight on Nuclear Safety and,UNGD
RUS,1996,"Security, convened as a result of a Russian initiative,",UNGD
RUS,1996,contributed significantly to a solution of this problem. I,UNGD
RUS,1996,call on all United Nations Member States to become,UNGD
RUS,1996,involved in the implementation of the Moscow,UNGD
RUS,1996,agreements.,UNGD
RUS,1996,The rights of an individual should occupy a central,UNGD
RUS,1996,place in any new concept of international security.,UNGD
RUS,1996,Strengthening the international human-rights protection,UNGD
RUS,1996,mechanism could ensure the observance of these rights.,UNGD
RUS,1996,Its oversight and preventive functions should be,UNGD
RUS,1996,"consolidated and made more practical. However,",UNGD
RUS,1996,legitimate efforts to ensure respect for human rights,UNGD
RUS,1996,cannot serve political purposes. It is too delicate an area,UNGD
RUS,1996,to be invaded by political speculation and objectives.,UNGD
RUS,1996,15,UNGD
RUS,1996,,UNGD
RUS,1996,,UNGD
RUS,1996,My comments apply fully to the protection of the,UNGD
RUS,1996,rights of national minorities. The relevance of this problem,UNGD
RUS,1996,is evident in today’s world. The complexity of the,UNGD
RUS,1996,situation — let us be frank — requires a link between the,UNGD
RUS,1996,protection of the rights of national minorities and,UNGD
RUS,1996,observance of the principle of the territorial integrity of,UNGD
RUS,1996,States. Russia is directing its policy at precisely such a link.,UNGD
RUS,1996,My comments also apply to the Baltic States. While,UNGD
RUS,1996,recognizing the sovereignty of those countries and their,UNGD
RUS,1996,"territorial integrity, Russia cannot remain indifferent to the",UNGD
RUS,1996,discriminatory practices pursued against the,UNGD
RUS,1996,Russian-speaking populations in Estonia and Latvia. While,UNGD
RUS,1996,acknowledging measures that have already been taken to,UNGD
RUS,1996,"improve the situation, we believe that the United Nations",UNGD
RUS,1996,and other international organizations should intensify and,UNGD
RUS,1996,systematize their work for the protection of the rights of,UNGD
RUS,1996,national minorities.,UNGD
RUS,1996,How do we implement this strategy for creating a new,UNGD
RUS,1996,world order? Despite the importance of bilateral relations,UNGD
RUS,1996,"and successful regional organizations, the United Nations",UNGD
RUS,1996,remains the principal mechanism capable of ensuring the,UNGD
RUS,1996,transition from a bipolar and confrontational world to a,UNGD
RUS,1996,"multipolar and democratic one. In such circumstances, the",UNGD
RUS,1996,significance of the United Nations as a centre for,UNGD
RUS,1996,coordinating the actions of States is increasing. During the,UNGD
RUS,1996,"formation of a multipolar system, the United Nations is",UNGD
RUS,1996,"called upon to serve as a kind of safety net, minimizing the",UNGD
RUS,1996,destructive effects of the changes and directing them,UNGD
RUS,1996,towards democratic evolution.,UNGD
RUS,1996,The major task of the United Nations remains the,UNGD
RUS,1996,maintenance of international peace and security.,UNGD
RUS,1996,"Furthermore, the principal tools available to the",UNGD
RUS,1996,Organization must be political and diplomatic. I remind the,UNGD
RUS,1996,"Assembly of this fact because, during the past few years",UNGD
RUS,1996,"within the United Nations, a “sanctions syndrome” has",UNGD
RUS,1996,begun to emerge: a desire to apply sanctions and other,UNGD
RUS,1996,"coercive measures more broadly and actively, sometimes",UNGD
RUS,1996,ignoring existing political and diplomatic avenues. We are,UNGD
RUS,1996,convinced that the United Nations should take such,UNGD
RUS,1996,"measures only in exceptional cases, after all other means",UNGD
RUS,1996,have been genuinely exhausted.,UNGD
RUS,1996,"On the whole, there is a need to modernize the United",UNGD
RUS,1996,"Nations sanctions mechanisms. Today, for example, no",UNGD
RUS,1996,"specific procedure is provided for lifting sanctions, and, as",UNGD
RUS,1996,"experience has demonstrated, this is extremely important.",UNGD
RUS,1996,The humanitarian damage caused by sanctions and the,UNGD
RUS,1996,damage to third countries should be minimized.,UNGD
RUS,1996,It is extremely important to emphasize that the,UNGD
RUS,1996,United Nations must be maintained as the sole,UNGD
RUS,1996,Organization that can authorize the use of force. Any,UNGD
RUS,1996,actions of that nature taken in circumvention of the,UNGD
RUS,1996,Security Council must be totally precluded.,UNGD
RUS,1996,The United Nations can and must work purposefully,UNGD
RUS,1996,towards establishing a new global legal framework. To,UNGD
RUS,1996,give impetus to such work Russia has proposed the,UNGD
RUS,1996,holding in 1999 of a third peace conference. This idea,UNGD
RUS,1996,already has the support of a significant number of States.,UNGD
RUS,1996,I believe that the time has come to discuss this initiative,UNGD
RUS,1996,in a constructive and substantive manner.,UNGD
RUS,1996,Past experience shows the need for new approaches,UNGD
RUS,1996,by the United Nations to peacekeeping operations. We,UNGD
RUS,1996,can already discern a pyramid regulating the relations of,UNGD
RUS,1996,the United Nations with regional organizations. Without,UNGD
RUS,1996,the development of such relations the United Nations may,UNGD
RUS,1996,not be able to withstand the burden of peacemaking,UNGD
RUS,1996,"actions. I refer specifically to a pyramid, because it is of",UNGD
RUS,1996,fundamental importance to do no harm to the Security,UNGD
RUS,1996,"Council, which bears the primary responsibility for the",UNGD
RUS,1996,maintenance of international peace.,UNGD
RUS,1996,We are counting on significantly more attention,UNGD
RUS,1996,being paid by the United Nations to conflicts in the area,UNGD
RUS,1996,"of the Commonwealth of Independent States. So far, the",UNGD
RUS,1996,major role in this respect has been played by Russia and,UNGD
RUS,1996,its Commonwealth partners.,UNGD
RUS,1996,"In view of present circumstances, Russia calls on the",UNGD
RUS,1996,United Nations to address the Afghan conflict. In that,UNGD
RUS,1996,"multinational and long-suffering country, a truly critical",UNGD
RUS,1996,"situation has arisen, and we have to do everything",UNGD
RUS,1996,possible to prevent the country from disintegrating. The,UNGD
RUS,1996,"Afghan tragedy, like the endless series of internal",UNGD
RUS,1996,"conflicts in Rwanda and Liberia, is the most convincing",UNGD
RUS,1996,argument for the development of a United Nations policy,UNGD
RUS,1996,of national reconciliation diplomacy.,UNGD
RUS,1996,"To cope with all these tasks, the United Nations",UNGD
RUS,1996,itself must be updated and adapted to these new,UNGD
RUS,1996,"conditions. Reform is long overdue, and it is not a single",UNGD
RUS,1996,measure that is required but a process that encompasses,UNGD
RUS,1996,the entire United Nations system. Reform of the United,UNGD
RUS,1996,"Nations requires clearly defined goals: first, that it carry",UNGD
RUS,1996,"out its activities in a timely manner; and secondly, that its",UNGD
RUS,1996,structure be optimized in order to enhance the,UNGD
RUS,1996,effectiveness of the Organization.,UNGD
RUS,1996,16,UNGD
RUS,1996,,UNGD
RUS,1996,,UNGD
RUS,1996,A great deal has already been done to implement,UNGD
RUS,1996,reform. The Secretary-General has made a considerable,UNGD
RUS,1996,"contribution to these efforts, and Russia supports the",UNGD
RUS,1996,continuation of this difficult and protracted effort.,UNGD
RUS,1996,It is a well-established tradition to conclude statements,UNGD
RUS,1996,before this Assembly by saying that the current session,UNGD
RUS,1996,must play a special role in strengthening peace and that,UNGD
RUS,1996,peoples are expecting us to make decisions. I am confident,UNGD
RUS,1996,that this session of the General Assembly will live up to the,UNGD
RUS,1996,expectations of Governments and the hopes of peoples: that,UNGD
RUS,1996,all of us will take a new step in humankind’s difficult,UNGD
RUS,1996,"transition towards a world united in its diversity, a world",UNGD
RUS,1996,that is open to universal economic and spiritual,UNGD
RUS,1996,"development, a world that promises security and stability —",UNGD
RUS,1996,a world in which States cooperate on an equal footing. Let,UNGD
RUS,1996,us work together for the sake of this goal.,UNGD

RUS,1997,"Mr. President, allow me sincerely to",UNGD
RUS,1997,"congratulate you, a representative of friendly Ukraine, on",UNGD
RUS,1997,your election to this responsible and honoured post. We,UNGD
RUS,1997,"are confident that under your Presidency, the General",UNGD
RUS,1997,Assembly will be able to achieve significant results.,UNGD
RUS,1997,"In just a little over 800 days, mankind will enter",UNGD
RUS,1997,upon the twenty-first century. From a historical point of,UNGD
RUS,1997,"view, this is indeed no more than a sprinter’s lap, and",UNGD
RUS,1997,"thus the need to look at what lies ahead, at what awaits",UNGD
RUS,1997,"us, would appear quite natural.",UNGD
RUS,1997,"One year ago, in speaking from this rostrum, I spoke",UNGD
RUS,1997,about the emerging process of a transition to a multipolar,UNGD
RUS,1997,world order. The developments of the past year support,UNGD
RUS,1997,"that. There is a growing diversity in the political,",UNGD
RUS,1997,economic and cultural development of countries. New,UNGD
RUS,1997,centres of economic and political influence in the world,UNGD
RUS,1997,"are shaping up, coupled, at the same time, with increased",UNGD
RUS,1997,intermeshing of the interests of different States and,UNGD
RUS,1997,peoples.,UNGD
RUS,1997,The horizons opening up to the international,UNGD
RUS,1997,community in the twenty-first century are making new,UNGD
RUS,1997,demands. These are the assertion of the ideals of,UNGD
RUS,1997,interdependency and partnership in inter-State relations;,UNGD
RUS,1997,the prevention of the emergence of new dividing lines or,UNGD
RUS,1997,exclusive bloc structures; and strict adherence by all to,UNGD
RUS,1997,the principles and rules of international law. As a separate,UNGD
RUS,1997,"issue, I should like to cite not only the creation of",UNGD
RUS,1997,conditions for economic and social progress of all,UNGD
RUS,1997,"countries, but also the maintenance of environmental",UNGD
RUS,1997,balance.,UNGD
RUS,1997,There is also a need to mention that the transition,UNGD
RUS,1997,from a confrontational bipolar world to a multipolar,UNGD
RUS,1997,system per se would not provide a solution to these,UNGD
RUS,1997,17,UNGD
RUS,1997,,UNGD
RUS,1997,,UNGD
RUS,1997,"problems. Furthermore, realistically minded people realize",UNGD
RUS,1997,that although we are moving farther away from the,UNGD
RUS,1997,"simplistic stereotypes of the ideological confrontation era,",UNGD
RUS,1997,the number of existing risks and threats in the world is not,UNGD
RUS,1997,decreasing.,UNGD
RUS,1997,Regional conflicts continue to be one of the major,UNGD
RUS,1997,sources of instability on the global level; they should not be,UNGD
RUS,1997,allowed to continue into the twenty-first century. How can,UNGD
RUS,1997,this be achieved? A characteristic of our days is the,UNGD
RUS,1997,increasing number of intra-State problems — conflicts of an,UNGD
RUS,1997,ethnic rather than social nature. There are many,UNGD
RUS,1997,"multinational States in the world today, and we support the",UNGD
RUS,1997,initiatives designed to prevent their forcible disintegration.,UNGD
RUS,1997,The formula for settling such conflicts in today’s,UNGD
RUS,1997,"world — and, of course, in the twenty-first century — can",UNGD
RUS,1997,and must combine the need to preserve the territorial,UNGD
RUS,1997,integrity of those States with the provision of the maximum,UNGD
RUS,1997,possible number of rights to their national minorities. To,UNGD
RUS,1997,abandon any of the principles of this two-track formula,UNGD
RUS,1997,would result not only in the continuation but in the,UNGD
RUS,1997,dangerous escalation of such conflict situations.,UNGD
RUS,1997,"Likewise, I wish to draw the Assembly’s particular",UNGD
RUS,1997,attention to a dangerous aspect of regional conflicts: their,UNGD
RUS,1997,ability to trigger terrorist waves and spread them far and,UNGD
RUS,1997,wide beyond the borders of the actual conflict zone. For,UNGD
RUS,1997,"example, many of the militants who launched a bloody",UNGD
RUS,1997,campaign of terror in a number of countries emerged out of,UNGD
RUS,1997,the ongoing armed conflict that still rages in Afghanistan.,UNGD
RUS,1997,"We strongly support the combat against terrorism,",UNGD
RUS,1997,"whatever trappings it may don, be it in Ireland or in Israel.",UNGD
RUS,1997,"Today, we will not be able to prevail in this fight without",UNGD
RUS,1997,all States pooling their efforts to combat this greatest of,UNGD
RUS,1997,evils. While we oppose the backing of terrorism in any,UNGD
RUS,1997,"form by any Government, we believe that we cannot",UNGD
RUS,1997,stigmatize individual Member States forever as international,UNGD
RUS,1997,"rogues, irrespective of changes in their policies, simply",UNGD
RUS,1997,because of their suspected links to terrorists.,UNGD
RUS,1997,"In the present-day world, no country can hold a",UNGD
RUS,1997,monopoly on any kind of conflict-resolution effort. This,UNGD
RUS,1997,fully applies as well to the long-standing conflict in the,UNGD
RUS,1997,"Middle East, where the settlement process has been",UNGD
RUS,1997,"stalemated. As the saying goes, “it takes two hands to",UNGD
RUS,1997,applaud”. Broad-based international efforts are required to,UNGD
RUS,1997,"undo the taut Middle East knot. Russia, as one of the co-",UNGD
RUS,1997,"sponsors of the peace process launched in 1991 in Madrid,",UNGD
RUS,1997,is prepared actively to cooperate actively with all to attain,UNGD
RUS,1997,this goal.,UNGD
RUS,1997,"For many years, so too has the Cyprus issue been",UNGD
RUS,1997,awaiting the effective international cooperation needed for,UNGD
RUS,1997,its resolution.,UNGD
RUS,1997,A synergy of efforts would provide the shortest cut,UNGD
RUS,1997,to the resolution of both long-standing and of relatively,UNGD
RUS,1997,new conflicts. But our stance by no means implies — and,UNGD
RUS,1997,I wish to emphasize this — that any individual country,UNGD
RUS,1997,that has influence in a zone of conflict or that can exert,UNGD
RUS,1997,it over conflicting parties should not make active use of,UNGD
RUS,1997,"its own potential. It must do so, however, without putting",UNGD
RUS,1997,up a high fence around itself to ward off others.,UNGD
RUS,1997,I should like in this connection to draw the,UNGD
RUS,1997,Assembly’s attention to Russia’s peacekeeping efforts in,UNGD
RUS,1997,the Commonwealth of Independent States region. First of,UNGD
RUS,1997,"all, as concerns Tajikistan, Russia is doing a great deal",UNGD
RUS,1997,since we are equipped with the particular tools needed to,UNGD
RUS,1997,"do the job, in part for historical reasons. Our efforts have",UNGD
RUS,1997,proved rather effective. Recently in Moscow an,UNGD
RUS,1997,agreement was signed that put an end to the armed strife,UNGD
RUS,1997,between the Government and the opposition in that,UNGD
RUS,1997,"country. The return to Dushanbe of Mr. Nuri, the",UNGD
RUS,1997,"opposition leader, shows that the agreement is already",UNGD
RUS,1997,working.,UNGD
RUS,1997,"Nevertheless, we want only our fair share of the",UNGD
RUS,1997,deal. We note with satisfaction that the attitudes of Russia,UNGD
RUS,1997,and the United Nations towards the parameters of the,UNGD
RUS,1997,"operation in Tajikistan are in concurrence, based on the",UNGD
RUS,1997,close cooperation between the United Nations Observer,UNGD
RUS,1997,"Mission, the collective Commonwealth of Independent",UNGD
RUS,1997,"States peacekeeping force, and the contingent of Russian",UNGD
RUS,1997,border troops. We welcome the intention of the United,UNGD
RUS,1997,Nations to expand the mandate of its observers and to,UNGD
RUS,1997,increase their number.,UNGD
RUS,1997,Nagorny Karabakh provides yet another example.,UNGD
RUS,1997,"Acting on its own, Russia has done a great deal to",UNGD
RUS,1997,stabilize the situation in the region. But I believe that we,UNGD
RUS,1997,have quite productively cooperated with the United States,UNGD
RUS,1997,"and France, which, jointly with Russia, are acting as co-",UNGD
RUS,1997,chairmen of the Organization for Security and,UNGD
RUS,1997,Cooperation in Europe’s Minsk process to settle the,UNGD
RUS,1997,Nagorny Karabakh conflict. The Georgian-Abkhaz,UNGD
RUS,1997,conflict offers a similar example.,UNGD
RUS,1997,I should now like to say a few words about,UNGD
RUS,1997,"peacekeeping as a whole. Over the last few years, a trend",UNGD
RUS,1997,"has been observed towards its decentralization. Naturally,",UNGD
RUS,1997,there are objective reasons for this: the financial,UNGD
RUS,1997,"constraints placed on the United Nations, and the increase",UNGD
RUS,1997,18,UNGD
RUS,1997,,UNGD
RUS,1997,,UNGD
RUS,1997,"in the number of regional organizations working, inter alia,",UNGD
RUS,1997,in peacekeeping. We see nothing wrong with such,UNGD
RUS,1997,decentralization.,UNGD
RUS,1997,"However, it is extremely important that peacekeeping",UNGD
RUS,1997,"activities, whatever their sponsorship, should rely first and",UNGD
RUS,1997,foremost on the underlying principles developed within the,UNGD
RUS,1997,United Nations framework. We need here to be extremely,UNGD
RUS,1997,cautious in dealing with peacekeeping activities. We believe,UNGD
RUS,1997,that actions involving force should be carried out solely,UNGD
RUS,1997,when authorized by the Security Council and under its,UNGD
RUS,1997,"direct supervision, as provided for in the Charter of the",UNGD
RUS,1997,United Nations.,UNGD
RUS,1997,As we move towards a multipolar world in the twenty-,UNGD
RUS,1997,"first century, it is essential to create conditions that will",UNGD
RUS,1997,"bring stability to a new world order. To that end, work",UNGD
RUS,1997,"must be completed to demolish the hurdles of the past and,",UNGD
RUS,1997,"above all, the legacy of the massive, decades-long arms",UNGD
RUS,1997,race.,UNGD
RUS,1997,"We are moving together along this path, and we are",UNGD
RUS,1997,determined to proceed further. Together with the United,UNGD
RUS,1997,"States, we have been steadily reducing our national strategic",UNGD
RUS,1997,arsenals. President Yeltsin of Russia and President Clinton,UNGD
RUS,1997,of the United States have reached an understanding on the,UNGD
RUS,1997,basic parameters for agreement in this area.,UNGD
RUS,1997,On the agenda now are systematic measures for a,UNGD
RUS,1997,reduction in the nuclear arsenals of all the nuclear Powers.,UNGD
RUS,1997,But let us be perfectly clear here: the stability of a,UNGD
RUS,1997,multipolar world cannot be ensured simply by ending the,UNGD
RUS,1997,nuclear-arms race of the past. It is also essential to have,UNGD
RUS,1997,guarantees against the re-emergence of that arms race on a,UNGD
RUS,1997,"new basis, and here I have in mind the desire of individual",UNGD
RUS,1997,countries to acquire nuclear weapons. This once again,UNGD
RUS,1997,proves the need for urgent measures to relieve tensions in,UNGD
RUS,1997,the relations between India and Pakistan.,UNGD
RUS,1997,Hence the essential need for the entire international,UNGD
RUS,1997,community to give a universal dimension to the Treaty on,UNGD
RUS,1997,the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Those few,UNGD
RUS,1997,"countries that have so far remained outside the Treaty must,",UNGD
RUS,1997,"in our view, come to grips with their responsibility. They",UNGD
RUS,1997,must realize that their own security is an integral part of,UNGD
RUS,1997,"global security, and they must assume those obligations to",UNGD
RUS,1997,which over 180 States have already committed themselves,UNGD
RUS,1997,as parties to the Treaty.,UNGD
RUS,1997,The entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-,UNGD
RUS,1997,"Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) on a global scale, as well as the",UNGD
RUS,1997,forthcoming talks to ban the production of weapon-grade,UNGD
RUS,1997,"fissile materials, figures likewise among those badly",UNGD
RUS,1997,needed steps intended to impart stability to global security,UNGD
RUS,1997,in the twenty-first century.,UNGD
RUS,1997,The implementation of the Convention on the,UNGD
RUS,1997,"Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling",UNGD
RUS,1997,and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction,UNGD
RUS,1997,is getting under way. We consider this document as one,UNGD
RUS,1997,of the major instruments designed to eliminate one of the,UNGD
RUS,1997,weapons of mass destruction subject to the greatest,UNGD
RUS,1997,proliferation. We have been working together with the,UNGD
RUS,1997,"deputies of the State Duma to ratify the Convention, and",UNGD
RUS,1997,"we look forward to the early, successful completion of",UNGD
RUS,1997,those efforts.,UNGD
RUS,1997,But even now it is conventional weaponry that is,UNGD
RUS,1997,"killing people in local conflicts, often in situations where",UNGD
RUS,1997,"hostilities have already stopped. In this connection, we are",UNGD
RUS,1997,fully aware of the humanitarian dimension of the problem,UNGD
RUS,1997,of landmines. We think that the elimination of the threat,UNGD
RUS,1997,"of landmines to people, especially to civilian populations,",UNGD
RUS,1997,"is long overdue. We advocate active, phased efforts and",UNGD
RUS,1997,negotiations to resolve it.,UNGD
RUS,1997,Stability on a global or regional level is impossible,UNGD
RUS,1997,without the establishment of security systems. We have,UNGD
RUS,1997,made headway in this direction on the European,UNGD
RUS,1997,continent. We feel confident that only a universal,UNGD
RUS,1997,organization which brings together all the members of the,UNGD
RUS,1997,European family of nations can serve as a foundation for,UNGD
RUS,1997,a genuinely durable security system in Europe in the,UNGD
RUS,1997,twenty-first century. I am talking here about the,UNGD
RUS,1997,Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,UNGD
RUS,1997,(OSCE). It is first and foremost in the frame of that,UNGD
RUS,1997,forum that it is possible to seek agreement with a view to,UNGD
RUS,1997,"meeting the new and diverse challenges, which are not",UNGD
RUS,1997,necessarily of a military and political nature.,UNGD
RUS,1997,A beneficial effect on the improvement of the,UNGD
RUS,1997,European climate has already been exerted by the,UNGD
RUS,1997,"Founding Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation and",UNGD
RUS,1997,Security between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,UNGD
RUS,1997,"and the Russian Federation, which was born out of the",UNGD
RUS,1997,agonizing quest for compromise. This document will have,UNGD
RUS,1997,broad international resonance and will doubtless play an,UNGD
RUS,1997,"essential role in European politics. Of course, the signing",UNGD
RUS,1997,of that document has not changed our negative view of,UNGD
RUS,1997,"NATO’s enlargement, which, on the one hand, totally",UNGD
RUS,1997,"ignores current realities and, on the other, is fraught with",UNGD
RUS,1997,the risk of creating new dividing lines.,UNGD
RUS,1997,19,UNGD
RUS,1997,,UNGD
RUS,1997,,UNGD
RUS,1997,I must mention yet another contribution to the,UNGD
RUS,1997,strengthening of good-neighbourly relations in Europe. I am,UNGD
RUS,1997,"referring to the agreements signed recently by Russia,",UNGD
RUS,1997,Ukraine and Belarus that have allowed our three countries,UNGD
RUS,1997,to take major steps forward in developing mutually,UNGD
RUS,1997,"beneficial, equitable relations which have strengthened",UNGD
RUS,1997,stability in the region.,UNGD
RUS,1997,Russia has an interest in the security and stability of,UNGD
RUS,1997,its Baltic neighbours and is ready to guarantee their,UNGD
RUS,1997,security. Such guarantees could be provided in the form of,UNGD
RUS,1997,our commitment backed by an agreement on good-,UNGD
RUS,1997,neighbourly relations between Russia and the Baltic States.,UNGD
RUS,1997,Such an agreement could become a kind of pact on regional,UNGD
RUS,1997,security and stability.,UNGD
RUS,1997,The Asia-Pacific dimension is also of great,UNGD
RUS,1997,significance to us. We are convinced that the Russian-,UNGD
RUS,1997,Chinese agreements on borders and military détente in the,UNGD
RUS,1997,"frontier zone, which were also signed by Kazakhstan,",UNGD
RUS,1997,"Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, will become a long-term factor",UNGD
RUS,1997,for stability in that vast region. Russia also holds a number,UNGD
RUS,1997,"of other Asian countries — including India, Japan and the",UNGD
RUS,1997,States of the Association of South-East Asian Nations,UNGD
RUS,1997,(ASEAN) — among its priority partners.,UNGD
RUS,1997,"At the same time, our future in the twenty-first century",UNGD
RUS,1997,at both the global and the regional levels depends directly,UNGD
RUS,1997,on whether the international community will be able to stop,UNGD
RUS,1997,and reverse the economic impoverishment of a great,UNGD
RUS,1997,number of the Member States of the United Nations.,UNGD
RUS,1997,A central role in resolving the most important tasks,UNGD
RUS,1997,facing all the countries of the world today belongs to the,UNGD
RUS,1997,United Nations.,UNGD
RUS,1997,"Established over half a century ago, the Organization",UNGD
RUS,1997,"in general has succeeded in passing the durability test,",UNGD
RUS,1997,"traversed the thorny road of the bloc-confrontation era,",UNGD
RUS,1997,survived both the ice-age period and the thaw in,UNGD
RUS,1997,international relations. But today this could be viewed as,UNGD
RUS,1997,axiomatic — the United Nations needs a rational,UNGD
RUS,1997,"renovation, referred to by virtually all the speakers in this",UNGD
RUS,1997,debate. The substantive report of Secretary-General Kofi,UNGD
RUS,1997,"Annan gives clear proof of this need. Today, figuratively",UNGD
RUS,1997,"speaking, the image of this Organization in the twenty-first",UNGD
RUS,1997,century is being shaped.,UNGD
RUS,1997,It is our strong conviction that the priority objective,UNGD
RUS,1997,of the Organization’s reform is to enhance the usefulness,UNGD
RUS,1997,"of the United Nations. Naturally, it is impossible to",UNGD
RUS,1997,reform the United Nations in order to increase its,UNGD
RUS,1997,effectiveness without overcoming the financial problems.,UNGD
RUS,1997,We must note that the financial problems of the United,UNGD
RUS,1997,Nations have unfortunately become chronic. It must,UNGD
RUS,1997,therefore be emphasized that the responsibility for the,UNGD
RUS,1997,financial health of the United Nations is borne by all,UNGD
RUS,1997,Member States and that they must all pay their dues,UNGD
RUS,1997,properly.,UNGD
RUS,1997,We are also in favour of expanding the membership,UNGD
RUS,1997,of the Security Council. A decision to that effect is long,UNGD
RUS,1997,overdue. But this expansion should not render our,UNGD
RUS,1997,Organization less efficient.,UNGD
RUS,1997,The reform of the United Nations will take place,UNGD
RUS,1997,against the background of the ever increasing role of,UNGD
RUS,1997,regional organizations. This is a fully logical process. At,UNGD
RUS,1997,"the same time, we are convinced that the special leading",UNGD
RUS,1997,role of the United Nations among all other universally,UNGD
RUS,1997,recognized international organizations must be preserved.,UNGD
RUS,1997,We see the United Nations in the twenty-first,UNGD
RUS,1997,"century as a highly efficient Organization, free from",UNGD
RUS,1997,"bureaucratic constraints, and as a proactive Organization",UNGD
RUS,1997,capable of swiftly responding to the challenges of the,UNGD
RUS,1997,contemporary world.,UNGD
RUS,1997,I began my remarks by encouraging concerted action,UNGD
RUS,1997,by the international community to concentrate on current,UNGD
RUS,1997,problems and on the prospects for the coming century.,UNGD
RUS,1997,And I shall conclude by citing a well-known saying:,UNGD
RUS,1997,"“Pessimists are no more than casual observers, it is the",UNGD
RUS,1997,"optimists who can change the world”. We are optimists,",UNGD
RUS,1997,and we believe that the United Nations will be able to,UNGD
RUS,1997,play a positive role in the ongoing evolution of the,UNGD
RUS,1997,international community.,UNGD
RUS,1997,,UNGD
RUS,1997,,UNGD
RUS,1997,,UNGD
RUS,1997,,UNGD
RUS,1997,,UNGD
RUS,1998,Mankind is increasingly feeling the winds,UNGD
RUS,1998,of the twenty-first century. What they bring depends on,UNGD
RUS,1998,"all of us, on whether or not we succeed in responding",UNGD
RUS,1998,collectively to new challenges and in establishing a,UNGD
RUS,1998,reliable system of international security and stability once,UNGD
RUS,1998,"we have overcome the vices, antagonisms and stereotypes",UNGD
RUS,1998,accumulated during the century about to end.,UNGD
RUS,1998,"This is not only possible, it is the imperative of our",UNGD
RUS,1998,times!,UNGD
RUS,1998,"A well-known Russian proverb says, â€œIf you would",UNGD
RUS,1998,"live in the world, live in peaceâ€. It contains a highly",UNGD
RUS,1998,philosophical message of everlasting value. Mankind will,UNGD
RUS,1998,live in peace and harmony once it has learned to resolve,UNGD
RUS,1998,"emerging problems through peaceful, political means.",UNGD
RUS,1998,States will live in peace and harmony once they have,UNGD
RUS,1998,recognized their interrelationship and interdependence and,UNGD
RUS,1998,started to seek collective responses to the challenges of,UNGD
RUS,1998,their times.,UNGD
RUS,1998,Experience confirms the truth of this popular,UNGD
RUS,1998,wisdom. The most recent example is the sharp,UNGD
RUS,1998,aggravation of the world monetary and financial crisis,UNGD
RUS,1998,"which has besieged many countries, including Russia,",UNGD
RUS,1998,which is undergoing sweeping economic reforms. The,UNGD
RUS,1998,current upheaval in the world financial markets can be,UNGD
RUS,1998,overcome only by joint efforts that do not pursue,UNGD
RUS,1998,unilateral advantages and are intended to ensure global,UNGD
RUS,1998,"economic stability. Interaction of States in this process,",UNGD
RUS,1998,"including within the framework of the United Nations,",UNGD
RUS,1998,"must, on principle, be raised to a new level.",UNGD
RUS,1998,"As for Russia, after overcoming an acute political",UNGD
RUS,1998,"crisis, the countryâs President, Boris N. Yeltsin, the",UNGD

RUS,1998,From this rostrum I pledge that Russia will not,UNGD
RUS,1998,deviate from the path of reform and will do its best to,UNGD

RUS,1998,preserve the democratic progress that has been made but,UNGD
RUS,1998,also to augment it.,UNGD
RUS,1998,"Likewise, Russiaâs foreign policy will remain",UNGD
RUS,1998,consistent and constructive. It is firmly geared towards,UNGD
RUS,1998,"building a democratic multipolar world, ensuring",UNGD
RUS,1998,interaction with other States in the interests of settling,UNGD

RUS,1998,"We are convinced that the problems before the world,",UNGD
RUS,1998,"no matter how complex they may be, can be solved on the",UNGD
RUS,1998,basis of strict observance of international law and close,UNGD
RUS,1998,interaction among States. Multilateral organizations and,UNGD
RUS,1998,mechanisms have a special role to play in this respect.,UNGD
RUS,1998,"Above all, this applies to the United Nations, which",UNGD
RUS,1998,continues to be the sole universal international,UNGD
RUS,1998,peacekeeping organization and is thus better equipped than,UNGD
RUS,1998,any other world body to reach agreements on how to settle,UNGD
RUS,1998,"conflicts, as well as to identify and remove the underlying",UNGD
RUS,1998,social and economic causes. It is important for United,UNGD
RUS,1998,Nations efforts to be reinforced by support from regional,UNGD
RUS,1998,organizations.,UNGD
RUS,1998,We highly value the level of interaction that now,UNGD
RUS,1998,exists between the United Nations and the Organization for,UNGD
RUS,1998,"Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), acting as a",UNGD
RUS,1998,"reliable partner in addressing complex European problems,",UNGD
RUS,1998,as well as interaction with the Organization of African,UNGD
RUS,1998,"Unity (OAU) and other regional organizations, including",UNGD
RUS,1998,the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). The,UNGD
RUS,1998,international community has developed a unique arsenal of,UNGD
RUS,1998,political and diplomatic tools intended for the resolution of,UNGD
RUS,1998,every international problem. It must be put to effective use.,UNGD
RUS,1998,Coercive actions constitute exceptional methods of last,UNGD
RUS,1998,resort. Their use must be strictly regulated by the rules of,UNGD
RUS,1998,international law and above all by the United Nations,UNGD
RUS,1998,"Charter. In other words, we advocate invoking the force of",UNGD
RUS,1998,law rather than the law of force in international affairs.,UNGD
RUS,1998,The fact that the Iraqi crisis which erupted earlier this,UNGD
RUS,1998,"year was settled precisely by political means, through the",UNGD
RUS,1998,joint efforts of many States and the initiatives launched by,UNGD
RUS,1998,"the United Nations Secretary-General, provided graphic",UNGD
RUS,1998,evidence that the potential inherent in constructive and,UNGD
RUS,1998,active diplomacy is by far more efficient than relying,UNGD
RUS,1998,exclusively on military force.,UNGD
RUS,1998,A new outbreak of tensions around Iraq has made us,UNGD
RUS,1998,"deeply concerned, since it is fraught with serious",UNGD
RUS,1998,consequences for regional and international stability. No,UNGD
RUS,1998,"doubt Iraq must fully travel its part of the road, resume full",UNGD
RUS,1998,cooperation with the United Nations Special Commission,UNGD
RUS,1998,and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and,UNGD
RUS,1998,implement relevant Security Council resolutions. On the,UNGD
RUS,1998,"other hand, the Security Council must adequately assess the",UNGD
RUS,1998,situation related to the elimination of Iraqâs weapons of,UNGD
RUS,1998,mass destruction and answer the question of whether or not,UNGD
RUS,1998,that country still poses a threat to regional and overall,UNGD
RUS,1998,international security after seven years of work carried out,UNGD
RUS,1998,there by United Nations inspectors. Concerted action by the,UNGD
RUS,1998,world community is required today to finally unblock this,UNGD
RUS,1998,crisis situation.,UNGD
RUS,1998,Political logic must prevail over the logic of force in,UNGD
RUS,1998,our search for ways to settle the explosive conflict in,UNGD
RUS,1998,Kosovo. The use of tools of coercion to resolve the,UNGD
RUS,1998,Kosovo conflict might lead to a major war with,UNGD
RUS,1998,unpredictable consequences for the Balkan region and,UNGD
RUS,1998,Europe at large. It is our firm belief that a political,UNGD
RUS,1998,solution is the only possible way of settling the problem,UNGD
RUS,1998,"of Kosovo, granting it broad autonomy and ensuring strict",UNGD
RUS,1998,respect for the territorial integrity of the Federal Republic,UNGD
RUS,1998,of Yugoslavia.,UNGD
RUS,1998,The bloodshed in Afghanistan continues in spite of,UNGD
RUS,1998,"the fact that, as experience has shown, only temporary",UNGD
RUS,1998,gains can be obtained in that country through the use of,UNGD
RUS,1998,"arms. Rather, it is only through a persistent search for",UNGD
RUS,1998,"political solutions, with the United Nations playing a",UNGD
RUS,1998,"central role, that genuine stabilization, real settlement,",UNGD
RUS,1998,formation of an efficient central Government recognized,UNGD
RUS,1998,"by all Afghans and, finally, assurance of Afghanistanâs",UNGD

RUS,1998,Collective political efforts are required to give a,UNGD
RUS,1998,second wind to the Middle East peace process. In our,UNGD
RUS,1998,"view, it is not so much the absence of fresh ideas or",UNGD
RUS,1998,proposals but rather the upsetting of the balance that has,UNGD
RUS,1998,stymied progress on all the negotiating tracks. It should,UNGD
RUS,1998,not be ignored that even if the Middle East process has,UNGD
RUS,1998,"long-term objectives, it also has its time limits. Russia has",UNGD
RUS,1998,consistently advocated the establishment of an,UNGD
RUS,1998,independent Palestinian State through political means and,UNGD
RUS,1998,negotiations. It is only in this way that the inalienable,UNGD
RUS,1998,rights of the Palestinians to self-determination and reliable,UNGD
RUS,1998,assurance of Israelâs legitimate security interests can be,UNGD
RUS,1998,realized.,UNGD

RUS,1998,already achieved.,UNGD
RUS,1998,The recently proposed settlement of the Lockerbie,UNGD
RUS,1998,case has been a major accomplishment of the international,UNGD

RUS,1998,relevant resolution was possible due to the constructive,UNGD
RUS,1998,approach taken by the parties concerned â€” the United,UNGD
RUS,1998,"States, Great Britain, France and Libya â€” as well as due",UNGD
RUS,1998,"to diplomatic efforts by many international organizations,",UNGD

RUS,1998,without delay to its implementation.,UNGD

RUS,1998,,UNGD
RUS,1998,,UNGD
RUS,1998,"Arguably, similar perseverance must be shown in the",UNGD

RUS,1998,Failure of the international community to fully,UNGD

RUS,1998,Africa in recent years is a source of growing concern.,UNGD
RUS,1998,"Moreover, new flash points of tension have emerged on that",UNGD
RUS,1998,continent. It must be admitted that so far attempts to,UNGD
RUS,1998,achieve full coordination between the United Nations and,UNGD
RUS,1998,Africaâs regional organizations have not succeeded. That is,UNGD
RUS,1998,why the upcoming Security Council ministerial meeting on,UNGD
RUS,1998,Africa should focus on shaping a strong common stance,UNGD
RUS,1998,capable of radically reversing the negative dynamics of,UNGD
RUS,1998,Africaâs latest developments.,UNGD
RUS,1998,"For objective reasons, Russia has paid special attention",UNGD
RUS,1998,to settlement of conflict situations in the CIS. Whether in,UNGD
RUS,1998,"Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Nagorno-Karabakh, Tajikistan or",UNGD
RUS,1998,"Trans-Dniestria, our country has but one objective â€”",UNGD
RUS,1998,"namely, promoting a political settlement and helping build",UNGD
RUS,1998,"lasting peace. As requested by the sides concerned, Russia",UNGD
RUS,1998,has undertaken a difficult peace-building mission and is,UNGD
RUS,1998,doing all it can to bring it to fruition. But the effort can,UNGD
RUS,1998,prove unavailing unless the parties in conflict show,UNGD
RUS,1998,goodwill and a constructive attitude and also receive more,UNGD
RUS,1998,"meaningful international backing, above all from the United",UNGD
RUS,1998,Nations and the OSCE.,UNGD
RUS,1998,"While making strong efforts to settle regional crises,",UNGD
RUS,1998,"we should not lose sight of global problems, some of which",UNGD
RUS,1998,have acquired a new dimension in the last year.,UNGD
RUS,1998,We cannot but feel concerned over the emergence of,UNGD
RUS,1998,a real threat in the form of the proliferation of nuclear,UNGD
RUS,1998,weapons throughout the planet. It is a common task of the,UNGD
RUS,1998,international community to encourage all countries to,UNGD
RUS,1998,accede both to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of,UNGD
RUS,1998,Nuclear Weapons and to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-,UNGD
RUS,1998,Ban Treaty. We welcome Brazilâs accession to the Non-,UNGD
RUS,1998,Proliferation Treaty.,UNGD
RUS,1998,Russia is committed to the idea of continued reduction,UNGD
RUS,1998,of nuclear weapon arsenals and the maintenance of strategic,UNGD
RUS,1998,"stability at lower armament levels. In this context, we",UNGD
RUS,1998,attach particularly great importance to the Russian-,UNGD
RUS,1998,American interaction in the area of reducing strategic,UNGD
RUS,1998,"offensive arms. In the course of his appointment hearings,",UNGD
RUS,1998,"Mr. Yevgeny M. Primakov, Chairman of the Russian",UNGD
RUS,1998,"Government, expressed his firm resolve a few days ago to",UNGD
RUS,1998,seek early ratification by the State Duma of the START II,UNGD
RUS,1998,"Treaty. Likewise, it is important for the United States to",UNGD
RUS,1998,ratify all documents related to START II.,UNGD
RUS,1998,Accession of the other nuclear Powers to the nuclear,UNGD
RUS,1998,arms control process is now on the agenda. We urge,UNGD
RUS,1998,careful consideration of a proposal made by President,UNGD
RUS,1998,Boris Yeltsin that calls on the nuclear Powers to deploy,UNGD
RUS,1998,nuclear weapons exclusively within the boundaries of,UNGD
RUS,1998,their national territories. We note with satisfaction the,UNGD
RUS,1998,recent consensus decision in the Conference on,UNGD
RUS,1998,Disarmament to start negotiations banning production of,UNGD
RUS,1998,nuclear-weapon-grade fissionable materials. What is of,UNGD
RUS,1998,special significance is that the decision was supported by,UNGD
RUS,1998,States that are not yet parties to the Treaty on the Non-,UNGD
RUS,1998,"Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, among others. We are",UNGD
RUS,1998,convinced that such a ban would be a further necessary,UNGD
RUS,1998,step in multilateral efforts to enhance the non-proliferation,UNGD
RUS,1998,regime and nuclear disarmament.,UNGD
RUS,1998,"The nuclear threat has many faces. Today, nuclear",UNGD
RUS,1998,terrorism can also be a source of that threat. What seemed,UNGD
RUS,1998,"to be science fiction yesterday can now, much to our",UNGD
RUS,1998,"regret, become a reality. Hence, strong action by the",UNGD

RUS,1998,Russia has repeatedly stated at the highest level its,UNGD
RUS,1998,firm opposition to terrorism in all its forms and,UNGD
RUS,1998,manifestations. International terrorism is one of the most,UNGD
RUS,1998,dangerous global challenges to international stability. It,UNGD
RUS,1998,can be successfully combated only through united action,UNGD
RUS,1998,"by all States. Indeed, only by acting together instead of",UNGD
RUS,1998,"making unilateral power moves, shall we be able to",UNGD
RUS,1998,succeed in our fight against that most dangerous of evils.,UNGD
RUS,1998,Militant separatism has become another factor that,UNGD
RUS,1998,destabilizes international relations. Relying exclusively on,UNGD
RUS,1998,extremist methods in the struggle for the national rights,UNGD
RUS,1998,"of minority groups within multinational States, separatism",UNGD
RUS,1998,often finds itself in league with terrorism and religious,UNGD
RUS,1998,fanaticism. Separatism inevitably provokes internal,UNGD
RUS,1998,conflicts in which neighbouring countries frequently get,UNGD
RUS,1998,"involved, thereby setting the stage for stoking regional",UNGD
RUS,1998,crises.,UNGD
RUS,1998,More than two and a half thousand national,UNGD
RUS,1998,minorities live in 150 countries of the world. Were all of,UNGD
RUS,1998,"them to aspire to a State entity of their own, the",UNGD
RUS,1998,disastrous and catastrophic consequences could easily be,UNGD
RUS,1998,imagined. Those who foment separatism should keep that,UNGD

RUS,1998,the relevant decisions aimed at combating the drug threat,UNGD
RUS,1998,adopted by the General Assembly at its special session.,UNGD
RUS,1998,The international community should take a common,UNGD
RUS,1998,stand in implementing the provisions of the Universal,UNGD
RUS,1998,"Declaration of Human Rights, whose fiftieth anniversary",UNGD
RUS,1998,"occurs this year. In this area, too, resolute joint action is",UNGD
RUS,1998,"needed in respect of those States which, under various",UNGD
RUS,1998,"pretexts, violate generally recognized human rights and",UNGD
RUS,1998,freedoms. There can be no tolerance of double standards,UNGD
RUS,1998,involving attempts to shield those who elevate to the level,UNGD
RUS,1998,of Government policy discrimination against a part of the,UNGD
RUS,1998,population. Russia cannot and will not remain indifferent to,UNGD
RUS,1998,the fate of hundreds of thousands of Russian-speaking,UNGD
RUS,1998,citizens subjected to harsh repressive measures in Latvia,UNGD
RUS,1998,"and Estonia. The international community, and above all the",UNGD
RUS,1998,"Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,",UNGD
RUS,1998,should closely watch the situation in those countries.,UNGD
RUS,1998,I have touched upon a few of the important issues,UNGD
RUS,1998,which the United Nations is called upon to deal with at this,UNGD
RUS,1998,time. It continues to play its unique role as facilitator of,UNGD
RUS,1998,"joint efforts by States to strengthen peace and security, deal",UNGD
RUS,1998,with urgent issues and meet new global challenges. To that,UNGD
RUS,1998,"end, it is necessary to improve United Nations mechanisms",UNGD
RUS,1998,and adapt them to todayâs needs. That is exactly what the,UNGD
RUS,1998,"process of reforming the United Nations, launched by",UNGD
RUS,1998,"Secretary-General Kofi Annan, seeks to accomplish. The",UNGD
RUS,1998,rationale behind it is enhanced efficiency for the,UNGD
RUS,1998,Organization.,UNGD
RUS,1998,That is the angle from which we approach the ongoing,UNGD
RUS,1998,discussion on the work of the Security Council. No one,UNGD
RUS,1998,should question the Security Councilâs primary,UNGD
RUS,1998,responsibility under the Charter for the maintenance of,UNGD
RUS,1998,peace and security. It is extremely important to preserve its,UNGD
RUS,1998,"effectiveness and its efficiency in decision-making, as well",UNGD
RUS,1998,as to build on internal cohesion and work coordination,UNGD
RUS,1998,methods developed in recent years.,UNGD
RUS,1998,I should like to reaffirm that we support the,UNGD
RUS,1998,implementation of reforms and changes in United Nations,UNGD
RUS,1998,mechanisms that will promote effective consolidation of the,UNGD
RUS,1998,United Nations and improve its activities. Among the steps,UNGD
RUS,1998,"taken to that end I wish to mention adoption, under United",UNGD
RUS,1998,"Nations auspices, of the Statute of the International",UNGD
RUS,1998,Criminal Court. Russiaâs initiative to launch a discussion on,UNGD
RUS,1998,ways to achieve international information security serves,UNGD
RUS,1998,"the same goal. In essence, our proposal is intended to offset",UNGD
RUS,1998,threats inherent in the use of the latest advances in science,UNGD
RUS,1998,and technology for purposes incompatible with the,UNGD
RUS,1998,maintenance of international security.,UNGD
RUS,1998,I wish to single out a dangerous tendency: that of,UNGD
RUS,1998,adapting the United Nations to meet the requirements of,UNGD
RUS,1998,"an individual State, or of replacing it altogether as, for",UNGD
RUS,1998,"example, in the case of peacekeeping. What I have in",UNGD
RUS,1998,mind are attempts to undercut the powers of the Security,UNGD
RUS,1998,"Council, as laid down in the Charter, to use coercive",UNGD
RUS,1998,measures. We must not allow a precedent to be created,UNGD
RUS,1998,involving the use of military potential in a crisis situation,UNGD
RUS,1998,without the consent of the Security Council. Surely it is,UNGD
RUS,1998,obvious that such actions could lead to a serious erosion,UNGD
RUS,1998,"of the existing system of international relations, whose",UNGD
RUS,1998,central element is the United Nations.,UNGD
RUS,1998,United Nations sanctions as an instrument of,UNGD
RUS,1998,international coercion also require a highly balanced,UNGD
RUS,1998,"approach. When introduced by the Security Council,",UNGD
RUS,1998,sanctions should not become a tool to fight a regime that,UNGD
RUS,1998,may be disliked. Sanctions should not make people suffer.,UNGD
RUS,1998,They should not destabilize the economic situation in the,UNGD
RUS,1998,country subjected to sanctions or in the adjacent region.,UNGD
RUS,1998,It is time to fine-tune the mechanism regulating the,UNGD
RUS,1998,imposition of sanctions and their duration and the,UNGD
RUS,1998,procedures for easing and lifting them.,UNGD
RUS,1998,"In short, individual elements of the United Nations",UNGD
RUS,1998,mechanism need improvement and retooling. But we,UNGD
RUS,1998,"should go about it with a full sense of responsibility,",UNGD
RUS,1998,mindful of the medical professionâs rule that unnecessary,UNGD
RUS,1998,harm is to be avoided at all costs.,UNGD
RUS,1998,"Every session of the General Assembly is, in a way,",UNGD
RUS,1998,a milestone event. Each session is expected to make a,UNGD
RUS,1998,tangible contribution to the resolution of acute problems,UNGD
RUS,1998,confronting mankind. It will depend on all of us whether,UNGD
RUS,1998,or not the fifty-third session of the General Assembly,UNGD
RUS,1998,lives up to the expectations and hopes we place in it. It,UNGD
RUS,1998,will depend on all of us whether or not joint effective,UNGD
RUS,1998,"steps are taken to lead us to a more stable, peaceful",UNGD
RUS,1998,"world, a world free from war and conflict and from",UNGD

RUS,1999,"transformation and social change, scientific discoveries and",UNGD
RUS,1999,achievements. The realization of the idea of a universal,UNGD

RUS,1999,"uniting the entire international community, has indeed been",UNGD
RUS,1999,one of the positive things about this century.,UNGD
RUS,1999,"However, the twentieth century has witnessed the most",UNGD
RUS,1999,severe upheavals. Millions of people have perished in the,UNGD
RUS,1999,"flames of world wars, revolutions and civil and ethnic",UNGD

RUS,1999,cannot resolve all these problems before the advent of the,UNGD

RUS,1999,down the foundations for resolving them in the long-term,UNGD

RUS,1999,The most important thing we should do is to define,UNGD
RUS,1999,the parameters of the world in which we are going to live.,UNGD
RUS,1999,This lies at the core of the initiative put forward by the,UNGD
RUS,1999,"President of the Russian Federation, President Yeltsin, to",UNGD
RUS,1999,develop a world concept for the twenty-first century. As a,UNGD
RUS,1999,world Power and permanent member of the Security,UNGD

RUS,1999,responsibility for world developments and stands for the,UNGD

RUS,1999,establishing equitable and mutually beneficial bilateral and,UNGD
RUS,1999,multilateral relations with all the countries of the world and,UNGD
RUS,1999,to strengthening international security and stability.,UNGD
RUS,1999,The world concept for the twenty-first century,UNGD
RUS,1999,involves establishing a new culture which would aim to,UNGD
RUS,1999,form a common system of values and models of,UNGD
RUS,1999,"behaviour. A world without wars and conflict, a world of",UNGD
RUS,1999,democracy and prosperity must be the highest priority for,UNGD
RUS,1999,all peoples and States. Every nation is entitled to its,UNGD

RUS,1999,"military, economic and social areas.",UNGD
RUS,1999,How and through what mechanisms can this be,UNGD
RUS,1999,achieved? Is there a body which can reflect the interests,UNGD
RUS,1999,of all States in a balanced manner? The answer is,UNGD
RUS,1999,"obvious: it is the United Nations. From the outset, the",UNGD
RUS,1999,United Nations Charter put the Organization at the service,UNGD
RUS,1999,of all humankind. There is simply no other universal,UNGD
RUS,1999,mechanism to regulate international relations.,UNGD
RUS,1999,We are fully aware of the danger posed by the,UNGD
RUS,1999,threats and challenges facing our world today: the various,UNGD
RUS,1999,"manifestations of militant nationalism, separatism,",UNGD
RUS,1999,"terrorism and extremism, which know no borders. This is",UNGD
RUS,1999,a common challenge which is claiming countless victims,UNGD
RUS,1999,and wreaking destruction in various parts of the globe.,UNGD
RUS,1999,"Aggressive separatism, which has become a growth",UNGD
RUS,1999,"medium for various extremist forces, has become one of",UNGD
RUS,1999,the main sources of domestic conflict and regional,UNGD
RUS,1999,instability. No one is immune to it. The international,UNGD
RUS,1999,"community and, above all, the United Nations, must",UNGD
RUS,1999,decisively clamp down on any manifestations of,UNGD
RUS,1999,separatism and strictly and consistently defend the,UNGD
RUS,1999,principles of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of,UNGD
RUS,1999,States and the inviolability of their borders. Outside,UNGD
RUS,1999,encouragement and support for separatist forces must be,UNGD

RUS,1999,"Recently, separatism has been increasingly merging",UNGD

RUS,1999,are aimed at organizing such acts against the citizens of,UNGD
RUS,1999,other countries. Russia therefore supports the initiative to,UNGD
RUS,1999,"convene, under United Nations auspices, a conference or",UNGD
RUS,1999,a special session of the General Assembly next year on,UNGD
RUS,1999,13,UNGD
RUS,1999,,UNGD
RUS,1999,,UNGD
RUS,1999,combating terrorism. Such an event would give a powerful,UNGD
RUS,1999,political impetus to the struggle against terrorism at a global,UNGD
RUS,1999,level.,UNGD
RUS,1999,The capabilities of the United Nations should also be,UNGD
RUS,1999,used more efficiently in the fight against drug-related,UNGD
RUS,1999,threats and organized crime. Only through joint efforts that,UNGD
RUS,1999,are also in strict compliance with the rules of international,UNGD
RUS,1999,law can we defeat this evil.,UNGD
RUS,1999,The founding fathers of the United Nations made,UNGD
RUS,1999,provision for a law-based response to violations of peace,UNGD
RUS,1999,and security. The international community can take also,UNGD
RUS,1999,"coercive measures, but this should be done in accordance",UNGD
RUS,1999,with the Charter and following a decision by the Security,UNGD
RUS,1999,Council. Unlawful means can only undermine rightful ends.,UNGD
RUS,1999,It is from this very perspective that we assess such,UNGD
RUS,1999,"doctrines as that of humanitarian intervention. In general,",UNGD
RUS,1999,we should take an extremely careful approach to coercive,UNGD
RUS,1999,"measures; what is more, we must not allow them to turn",UNGD
RUS,1999,into a repressive mechanism for influencing States and,UNGD
RUS,1999,peoples that are not to the liking of some.,UNGD
RUS,1999,"Of course, evolution of the international situation",UNGD
RUS,1999,means that it is appropriate for existing rules of,UNGD
RUS,1999,international law to be developed and adapted to prevailing,UNGD
RUS,1999,"conditions, but this should be done through collective",UNGD
RUS,1999,"discussion and the adoption of appropriate decisions, not as",UNGD
RUS,1999,a fait accompli and not working from scratch: it should be,UNGD
RUS,1999,based on valid rules of international law. This is precisely,UNGD
RUS,1999,what Russia had in mind with its initiative to consider at,UNGD
RUS,1999,the Millennium Summit legal aspects of the use of force in,UNGD
RUS,1999,international relations in the era of globalization. We invite,UNGD
RUS,1999,all countries to a broad and open dialogue on this issue.,UNGD
RUS,1999,Much has been said in recent years about the reform,UNGD
RUS,1999,"of the United Nations, which is only natural. Life is an",UNGD
RUS,1999,"evolving process and, as times change, any system will",UNGD
RUS,1999,need to be updated. What objectives future reform should,UNGD
RUS,1999,"pursue is another matter. In our view, reform means, first",UNGD
RUS,1999,"and foremost, the adoption of a package of measures to",UNGD
RUS,1999,enhance the role of the United Nations in the world arena.,UNGD
RUS,1999,The Organization should be ready to respond in a timely,UNGD
RUS,1999,and appropriate way to the challenges that globalization,UNGD
RUS,1999,presents to mankind. We must give serious thought to how,UNGD
RUS,1999,to enhance the efficiency of the Security Council and how,UNGD
RUS,1999,to make that principal organ of the United Nations more,UNGD
RUS,1999,representative through the inclusion of influential new,UNGD
RUS,1999,"members, including — and this is absolutely",UNGD
RUS,1999,indispensable — developing countries. This would help,UNGD
RUS,1999,maintain the overall balance in the system of international,UNGD
RUS,1999,"relations, especially when the use of force, bypassing the",UNGD
RUS,1999,"Security Council, continues. It is also beyond doubt that",UNGD
RUS,1999,preservation of the right of veto of permanent members,UNGD
RUS,1999,is indispensable for meaningful and efficient work in the,UNGD
RUS,1999,Council.,UNGD
RUS,1999,"Generally speaking, the entire system of international",UNGD
RUS,1999,organizations needs sensible and responsible reform. At,UNGD
RUS,1999,"the same time, the United Nations must remain a focal",UNGD
RUS,1999,point of the international community’s efforts to settle the,UNGD
RUS,1999,most burning problems of the day. The issue of,UNGD
RUS,1999,strengthening the authority of the United Nations after it,UNGD
RUS,1999,has been seriously and painfully tested by the Balkan and,UNGD
RUS,1999,Iraq crises is at the very top of the agenda at the current,UNGD
RUS,1999,"session of the General Assembly. First of all, we must",UNGD
RUS,1999,continue strenuous efforts to restore the role of the,UNGD
RUS,1999,Security Council in world affairs.,UNGD
RUS,1999,We have managed through joint efforts to bring the,UNGD
RUS,1999,settlement of the Kosovo problem back within the legal,UNGD
RUS,1999,and political framework of the United Nations. Now we,UNGD
RUS,1999,need jointly to strive for strict and consistent,UNGD
RUS,1999,implementation of Security Council resolution 1244,UNGD
RUS,1999,(1999). We cannot afford to let the re-emerging political,UNGD
RUS,1999,"process be undermined again, since that could become a",UNGD
RUS,1999,tragedy for all of Europe and could once again bring the,UNGD
RUS,1999,world to the brink of catastrophe. Equally urgent is the,UNGD
RUS,1999,issue of post-conflict rehabilitation in the Balkans. The,UNGD
RUS,1999,United Nations has an important role to play in meeting,UNGD
RUS,1999,these challenges as well.,UNGD
RUS,1999,We all should draw serious lessons from recent,UNGD
RUS,1999,crises. Non-legitimate methods of exerting power only,UNGD
RUS,1999,exacerbate problems and result in even greater deadlock.,UNGD
RUS,1999,"Developments in the Middle East, where the peace",UNGD
RUS,1999,"process has of late acquired a new positive impetus,",UNGD
RUS,1999,"clearly exemplify the optimal alternative, that of",UNGD
RUS,1999,negotiated settlement.,UNGD
RUS,1999,Also on the agenda is the issue of improving,UNGD
RUS,1999,"sanctions regimes, to which the international community",UNGD
RUS,1999,has frequently resorted over the past decade. Sanctions,UNGD
RUS,1999,are an extreme measure. They must be applied only when,UNGD
RUS,1999,other means of political influence have been exhausted,UNGD
RUS,1999,and when the Security Council has established the,UNGD
RUS,1999,"existence of a threat to peace. The Council, for its part,",UNGD
RUS,1999,should be guided by clear criteria for the imposition and,UNGD
RUS,1999,"the lifting of sanctions, and should not permit any free",UNGD
RUS,1999,"interpretation of the decisions it has adopted, much less",UNGD
RUS,1999,permit the use of its decisions by anyone for selfish,UNGD
RUS,1999,political or economic ends. It is necessary to take very,UNGD
RUS,1999,serious account of the humanitarian implications of,UNGD
RUS,1999,sanctions both for the population of the States subject to,UNGD
RUS,1999,14,UNGD
RUS,1999,,UNGD
RUS,1999,,UNGD
RUS,1999,such sanctions and for third countries. The punishment of,UNGD
RUS,1999,"entire nations, especially for an indefinite time and",UNGD
RUS,1999,"indiscriminately, is inadmissible.",UNGD
RUS,1999,Peacemaking is one of the key areas of United Nations,UNGD
RUS,1999,activities. During the past 50 years the Organization has,UNGD
RUS,1999,acquired vast practical experience in this field. Having,UNGD
RUS,1999,successfully survived intense disputes and ideological,UNGD
RUS,1999,"battles, peacemaking has proved its vital power and",UNGD
RUS,1999,importance for securing world and regional stability. The,UNGD
RUS,1999,evolution of the theory and practice of present-day,UNGD
RUS,1999,peacemaking confirms that there is no alternative to,UNGD
RUS,1999,maintaining the central role of the United Nations in this,UNGD
RUS,1999,sphere. The encouragement of peacemaking and the,UNGD
RUS,1999,strengthening of its legal basis in strict conformity with the,UNGD
RUS,1999,fundamental principles of the Charter should become an,UNGD
RUS,1999,important component of the concept of the world in the,UNGD
RUS,1999,twenty-first century. Building up and modernizing the anti-,UNGD
RUS,1999,crisis capability of the United Nations is a key prerequisite,UNGD
RUS,1999,for tackling these tasks successfully. The top priority here,UNGD
RUS,1999,is to begin truly using the system of stand-by agreements,UNGD
RUS,1999,with the United Nations.,UNGD
RUS,1999,Taking into account the limited resources of the world,UNGD
RUS,1999,"Organization, and given the high demand for peacekeeping",UNGD
RUS,1999,"operations, cooperation and division of labour between the",UNGD
RUS,1999,United Nations and regional structures has become a,UNGD
RUS,1999,priority. It is of fundamental importance that such,UNGD
RUS,1999,cooperation should be in strict accordance with Chapter,UNGD
RUS,1999,VIII of the Charter and should be fully consistent with the,UNGD
RUS,1999,prerogatives of the Security Council.,UNGD
RUS,1999,"For Russia, the question of peacemaking cooperation",UNGD
RUS,1999,between the United Nations and regional organizations is,UNGD
RUS,1999,"far from theoretical. For many years, Russian peacemakers",UNGD
RUS,1999,within the peacekeeping forces of the Commonwealth of,UNGD
RUS,1999,Independent States (CIS) have contributed to stabilizing the,UNGD
RUS,1999,"situations in Abkhazia, Georgia, in Tajikistan, and in Trans-",UNGD
RUS,1999,"Dniestria, Moldova. This testifies to the fact that the",UNGD
RUS,1999,settlement of conflicts within the framework of the CIS is,UNGD
RUS,1999,"a priority for Russia. As before, we do not see any",UNGD
RUS,1999,reasonable alternative to political settlement of these crisis,UNGD
RUS,1999,"situations, for which political will, patience and",UNGD
RUS,1999,commitment to one’s obligations are needed. We consider,UNGD
RUS,1999,it important for the United Nations to continue to play a,UNGD
RUS,1999,prominent role in finding solutions in Tajikistan and in,UNGD
RUS,1999,"Abkhazia, Georgia.",UNGD
RUS,1999,The Organization for Security and Cooperation in,UNGD
RUS,1999,"Europe (OSCE), which is called upon to play a central role",UNGD
RUS,1999,"in ensuring European security and stability, can and should",UNGD
RUS,1999,be the main United Nations peacemaking partner in Europe.,UNGD
RUS,1999,"When this arrangement fails to work, not only do specific",UNGD
RUS,1999,"European countries suffer, but providing for global and",UNGD
RUS,1999,continental security becomes complicated. In a broad,UNGD
RUS,1999,"sense, OSCE peacemaking parameters, ranging from",UNGD
RUS,1999,conflict prevention to peacekeeping operations and post-,UNGD
RUS,1999,"conflict rehabilitation, should be defined in a charter on",UNGD
RUS,1999,European security. Russia proposes too that the charter,UNGD
RUS,1999,should also reflect such principles important for the future,UNGD
RUS,1999,of Europeans as ensuring the security and the foundations,UNGD
RUS,1999,of the relations between European and Euro-Atlantic,UNGD
RUS,1999,organizations in this area. Then the charter will indeed,UNGD
RUS,1999,become a kind of political constitution for the Europe of,UNGD
RUS,1999,the twenty-first century. As the Istanbul summit of the,UNGD
RUS,1999,"OSCE, which is expected to adopt the charter, is",UNGD
RUS,1999,"approaching fast, we should press ahead with the",UNGD
RUS,1999,formulation of a substantive document.,UNGD
RUS,1999,The Conference on Interaction and Confidence-,UNGD
RUS,1999,building Measures in Asia may become an important,UNGD
RUS,1999,factor for stability on the Asian continent after the new,UNGD
RUS,1999,positive impetus it received at the recent Almaty Foreign,UNGD
RUS,1999,Affairs Ministers’ Meeting of the founding States. The,UNGD
RUS,1999,Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN),UNGD
RUS,1999,"Regional Forum, a venue for active dialogue on a broad",UNGD
RUS,1999,"spectrum of urgent international issues, is yet another",UNGD
RUS,1999,example of the focus of the Asian countries on the,UNGD
RUS,1999,formation of solid structures for security and cooperation,UNGD
RUS,1999,on the continent.,UNGD
RUS,1999,It is necessary to enhance the potential of African,UNGD
RUS,1999,"regional and subregional organizations, which are acting",UNGD
RUS,1999,in close cooperation with the United Nations to curb and,UNGD
RUS,1999,cope with conflicts and humanitarian catastrophes,UNGD
RUS,1999,emerging in Africa. It is the duty of the international,UNGD
RUS,1999,community to render every possible support to the,UNGD
RUS,1999,African peoples.,UNGD
RUS,1999,While strengthening the legal and practical basis of,UNGD
RUS,1999,"peacemaking activities, special attention should be paid to",UNGD
RUS,1999,what is commonly called the human rights dimension.,UNGD
RUS,1999,This relates not only to measures to minimize human,UNGD
RUS,1999,"sufferings caused by armed conflicts, but also to efforts",UNGD
RUS,1999,aimed at preventing humanitarian crises.,UNGD
RUS,1999,"In this connection, I cannot fail to mention the",UNGD
RUS,1999,unacceptable situation of countless thousands of people in,UNGD
RUS,1999,"the centre of Europe who, due to arbitrary actions by",UNGD
RUS,1999,"authorities, have found themselves deprived of their",UNGD
RUS,1999,citizenship and of the right to use their native language,UNGD
RUS,1999,and enjoy full rights in their State of residence. Civilized,UNGD
RUS,1999,"integration, rather than latent assimilation — this is the",UNGD
RUS,1999,way out of the prevailing humanitarian situation in these,UNGD
RUS,1999,15,UNGD
RUS,1999,,UNGD
RUS,1999,,UNGD
RUS,1999,countries. We welcome the efforts of the Organization for,UNGD
RUS,1999,"Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Council",UNGD
RUS,1999,of Europe and the Council of Baltic Sea States (CBSS),UNGD
RUS,1999,aimed at eliminating violations of human rights and,UNGD
RUS,1999,freedoms of the non-indigenous population of Latvia and,UNGD
RUS,1999,Estonia. We hope that the United Nations High,UNGD
RUS,1999,Commissioner for Human Rights will make her contribution,UNGD
RUS,1999,to these efforts.,UNGD
RUS,1999,The risk of losing positive dynamics in the sphere of,UNGD
RUS,1999,disarmament as a result of attempts to rely on unilateral,UNGD
RUS,1999,power methods cannot but cause concern. If the political,UNGD
RUS,1999,and legal fabric regulating international relations continues,UNGD
RUS,1999,"to disintegrate further, then trends to ensure national",UNGD
RUS,1999,security through an arms race will become even stronger.,UNGD
RUS,1999,Russia has consistently advocated the reduction and,UNGD
RUS,1999,limitation of nuclear arsenals and strict compliance with the,UNGD
RUS,1999,"non-proliferation regime. For without this, ensuring",UNGD
RUS,1999,strategic stability would prove impossible.,UNGD
RUS,1999,We realize the importance of early ratification of the,UNGD
RUS,1999,START II Treaty and of the initiation of START III,UNGD
RUS,1999,"negotiations, under which Russia would be prepared, on a",UNGD
RUS,1999,"reciprocal basis, to agree to considerable further reduction",UNGD
RUS,1999,"of strategic offensive armaments. Naturally, this process",UNGD
RUS,1999,"will be feasible only if the existing agreements in this field,",UNGD
RUS,1999,"first of all the ABM Treaty, are strictly observed. We",UNGD
RUS,1999,believe that the General Assembly should come out clearly,UNGD
RUS,1999,in support of the preservation and observance of the ABM,UNGD
RUS,1999,"Treaty, which is a cornerstone of strategic stability, because",UNGD
RUS,1999,unilateral actions aimed at undermining the time-tested,UNGD
RUS,1999,regime established by this Treaty are fraught with,UNGD
RUS,1999,extremely dangerous consequences. A collective search for,UNGD
RUS,1999,political and diplomatic solutions is the alternative to,UNGD
RUS,1999,military responses to the problems of proliferation. This is,UNGD
RUS,1999,precisely the target of Russia’s initiative concerning the,UNGD
RUS,1999,global system of control over proliferation of missiles and,UNGD
RUS,1999,missile technologies.,UNGD
RUS,1999,Substantive discussions on threats to international,UNGD
RUS,1999,information security must also be continued within the,UNGD
RUS,1999,framework and under the auspices of the United Nations.,UNGD
RUS,1999,"The time has come to reach, through joint efforts, a",UNGD
RUS,1999,common understanding of such threats and of measures to,UNGD
RUS,1999,reduce them.,UNGD
RUS,1999,The twentieth century has brought about economic,UNGD
RUS,1999,globalization. All economies have become open and closely,UNGD
RUS,1999,linked as a result of advances in science and technology.,UNGD
RUS,1999,All these factors have provided a powerful impetus to,UNGD
RUS,1999,social and economic development while creating their own,UNGD
RUS,1999,specific problems. The gap between the industrial and the,UNGD
RUS,1999,formerly colonial worlds has not only persisted but has,UNGD
RUS,1999,begun to widen. Development assistance should remain a,UNGD
RUS,1999,"principal focus of future United Nations activities. Crises,",UNGD
RUS,1999,"primarily financial ones, have assumed an international",UNGD
RUS,1999,character. We must draw the appropriate lessons and,UNGD
RUS,1999,modernize the architecture of the world financial system.,UNGD
RUS,1999,The United Nations and its specialized agencies should,UNGD
RUS,1999,play a role here.,UNGD
RUS,1999,The expansion of human economic activities has,UNGD
RUS,1999,brought about a globalization of both natural and,UNGD
RUS,1999,"man-made disasters, and this has become a major",UNGD
RUS,1999,destabilizing global factor. The challenges related to the,UNGD
RUS,1999,prevention of such disasters and the elimination of their,UNGD
RUS,1999,consequences require that the most advanced technologies,UNGD
RUS,1999,be used for the benefit of the world community as a,UNGD
RUS,1999,"whole. Why not consider, therefore, the establishment,",UNGD
RUS,1999,"under the auspices of the United Nations, of a specialized",UNGD

RUS,2000,The strategy of survival must give way to a,UNGD

RUS,2000,through the preservation and strengthening of strategic,UNGD

RUS,2000,Strategic stability means further progress in the,UNGD
RUS,2000,"disarmament process, reliable prevention of the spread",UNGD

RUS,2000,needed is the effective involvement of multilateral,UNGD

RUS,2000,community in those processes.,UNGD
RUS,2000,The outcome of the Millennium Summit provides,UNGD
RUS,2000,additional opportunities for the achievement of a major,UNGD
RUS,2000,breakthrough in disarmament in the twenty-first,UNGD
RUS,2000,century. This will require consistent joint efforts aimed,UNGD
RUS,2000,at strict compliance with the agreements already,UNGD
RUS,2000,concluded; a step-by-step reduction and eventual,UNGD
RUS,2000,elimination of weapons of mass destruction under,UNGD

RUS,2000,The time has come to give a new impetus to the,UNGD
RUS,2000,"work of the Conference on Disarmament, which has",UNGD
RUS,2000,proved in practice the effectiveness of multilateral,UNGD
RUS,2000,diplomacy under the auspices of the United Nations.,UNGD
RUS,2000,Russia advocates the resumption of substantive work at,UNGD
RUS,2000,that forum on major issues on the disarmament agenda.,UNGD
RUS,2000,The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear,UNGD
RUS,2000,Weapons (NPT) provides an indispensable international,UNGD
RUS,2000,legal basis for nuclear disarmament. This has once,UNGD
RUS,2000,again been reaffirmed in full by the 2000 Review,UNGD
RUS,2000,Conference. Russia will work to ensure that the,UNGD
RUS,2000,decisions of the Millennium Assembly promote the,UNGD

RUS,2000,"implementation, under the auspices of the International",UNGD
RUS,2000,"Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), of an international",UNGD
RUS,2000,project designed to phase out the use of enriched,UNGD

RUS,2000,We are satisfied to note the increasing number of,UNGD
RUS,2000,States acceding to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty,UNGD
RUS,2000,(CTBT). Its speedy entry into force is in the interests of,UNGD
RUS,2000,the entire international community. Having ratified the,UNGD
RUS,2000,"Treaty, we call on those that have yet not done so to",UNGD
RUS,2000,follow suit.,UNGD
RUS,2000,We expect that the United States will follow,UNGD
RUS,2000,Russia in completing ratification of the Treaty on the,UNGD
RUS,2000,Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic,UNGD
RUS,2000,"Offensive Arms (START II), which will help make it",UNGD
RUS,2000,operational. We are ready to actively continue the,UNGD
RUS,2000,process of nuclear disarmament and to move towards,UNGD
RUS,2000,the conclusion of a START III Treaty with an even,UNGD
RUS,2000,"lower threshold of nuclear warheads — down to 1,500",UNGD
RUS,2000,units. But this will be feasible only if the 1972 Anti-,UNGD
RUS,2000,Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty remains intact. It is,UNGD
RUS,2000,universally acknowledged that this major Treaty,UNGD
RUS,2000,concerns the vital security interests of the international,UNGD

RUS,2000,other weapons of mass destruction.,UNGD
RUS,2000,Russia will be introducing a draft resolution in,UNGD

RUS,2000,the fortieth anniversary of the first manned flight to,UNGD

RUS,2000,proposal will be actively supported.,UNGD
RUS,2000,Strategic stability means reliable safeguarding of,UNGD

RUS,2000,the use of scientific and technological achievements for,UNGD
RUS,2000,purposes incompatible with universal progress and the,UNGD
RUS,2000,maintenance of international peace. Aware of the great,UNGD
RUS,2000,"importance of resolving these most urgent issues,",UNGD
RUS,2000,Russia will introduce for consideration by the General,UNGD
RUS,2000,Assembly a draft resolution entitled “Developments in,UNGD
RUS,2000,the field of informatization and telecommunications in,UNGD
RUS,2000,the context of international information security”.,UNGD
RUS,2000,Strategic stability also means enhancing peace,UNGD
RUS,2000,"and security on all continents, settling existing regional",UNGD
RUS,2000,conflicts and preventing new ones and cutting off,UNGD
RUS,2000,external support for them. Millions of people must be,UNGD
RUS,2000,spared the death and suffering caused by local crises.,UNGD
RUS,2000,7,UNGD
RUS,2000,,UNGD
RUS,2000,How can this goal be achieved? It is only through,UNGD
RUS,2000,the joint efforts of all States collectively responsible,UNGD
RUS,2000,for the world's destiny. Experience has shown that,UNGD
RUS,2000,unilateral enforcement actions cannot guarantee a,UNGD
RUS,2000,lasting and fair settlement of crisis situations.,UNGD
RUS,2000,The notions of sovereignty and the territorial,UNGD
RUS,2000,integrity of States are still very much alive. Disregard,UNGD
RUS,2000,for these principles and military intervention,UNGD
RUS,2000,"circumventing the Security Council, whatever",UNGD
RUS,2000,"humanitarian pretexts may be used, undermine the very",UNGD
RUS,2000,foundations of the world order and pave the way for,UNGD
RUS,2000,arbitrariness in international affairs.,UNGD
RUS,2000,The prevention and settlement of crises should,UNGD
RUS,2000,become a key element of international security in the,UNGD
RUS,2000,twenty-first century. When there is collective,UNGD
RUS,2000,"determination and goodwill, even the most complex",UNGD
RUS,2000,and major problems lend themselves to a political,UNGD
RUS,2000,resolution.,UNGD
RUS,2000,All of this calls for improvement of the,UNGD
RUS,2000,peacekeeping potential of our Organization. People in,UNGD
RUS,2000,“hotbeds” of the planet — from Africa and Lebanon to,UNGD
RUS,2000,East Timor — rightly associate with the United Nations,UNGD
RUS,2000,“Blue Helmets” their hopes for an end to bloody,UNGD
RUS,2000,conflicts and for the beginning of complex,UNGD
RUS,2000,reconciliation processes. They expect rapid and,UNGD
RUS,2000,effective steps from us.,UNGD
RUS,2000,We hope that the Millennium Assembly will,UNGD
RUS,2000,provide us with an opportunity to engage in a,UNGD
RUS,2000,comprehensive analysis of the work of United Nations,UNGD
RUS,2000,peacekeeping mechanisms and outline ways to increase,UNGD
RUS,2000,their efficiency. Such is the objective of the report,UNGD
RUS,2000,(A/55/305) prepared under the aegis of the Secretary-,UNGD
RUS,2000,General by the Brahimi Panel. It is important to,UNGD
RUS,2000,considerably enhance the United Nations capacity for,UNGD
RUS,2000,the prompt deployment of peacekeeping operations.,UNGD
RUS,2000,This can be done through the early completion of the,UNGD
RUS,2000,system of standby arrangements. Peacekeeping units of,UNGD
RUS,2000,"the United Nations Secretariat need to be strengthened,",UNGD
RUS,2000,"with provision for professional planning, control and",UNGD
RUS,2000,command of operations.,UNGD
RUS,2000,Russia consistently advocates the expansion of,UNGD
RUS,2000,cooperation between the United Nations and regional,UNGD
RUS,2000,structures in the field of peacekeeping. Chapter VIII of,UNGD
RUS,2000,the United Nations Charter remains the basis for such,UNGD
RUS,2000,interaction. Any regional or “coalition” operation,UNGD
RUS,2000,should be conducted under conditions of transparency,UNGD
RUS,2000,and of reporting to the United Nations Security,UNGD
RUS,2000,"Council, whereas operations with enforcement",UNGD
RUS,2000,elements should be carried out only with the,UNGD
RUS,2000,authorization of the Security Council.,UNGD
RUS,2000,The Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS),UNGD
RUS,2000,is a major regional partner of the United Nations in,UNGD
RUS,2000,"peacekeeping. In many respects, it was the close",UNGD
RUS,2000,cooperation between the United Nations and the CIS,UNGD
RUS,2000,that made it possible to successfully resolve the,UNGD
RUS,2000,conflict in Tajikistan. Such interaction will,UNGD
RUS,2000,undoubtedly intensify along with the development of,UNGD
RUS,2000,"the CIS anti-crisis potential. At the same time, for a",UNGD
RUS,2000,stable peace to prevail in the conflict-affected regions,UNGD
RUS,2000,in the CIS area the volume of international economic,UNGD
RUS,2000,and humanitarian aid for their rehabilitation should be,UNGD
RUS,2000,increased.,UNGD
RUS,2000,Russia attaches primary importance to the,UNGD
RUS,2000,expansion of cooperation between the United Nations,UNGD
RUS,2000,and regional and subregional mechanisms in Africa to,UNGD
RUS,2000,provide for more effective crisis response on the,UNGD
RUS,2000,continent. This is evidenced by the Russian,UNGD
RUS,2000,participation in peacekeeping operations in a number of,UNGD
RUS,2000,African countries.,UNGD
RUS,2000,The entire experience of United Nations,UNGD
RUS,2000,peacekeeping activities in recent years clearly shows,UNGD
RUS,2000,the priority of political and diplomatic methods of,UNGD
RUS,2000,conflict settlement. It is precisely these methods that,UNGD
RUS,2000,make it possible to minimize the suffering of the,UNGD
RUS,2000,civilian population and to find ways to a stable peace.,UNGD
RUS,2000,Strategic stability means the security and,UNGD
RUS,2000,tranquillity of civil society and of the individual. This,UNGD
RUS,2000,task can be accomplished only through the combined,UNGD
RUS,2000,efforts of the international community to counter,UNGD
RUS,2000,"contemporary threats and challenges. These include,",UNGD
RUS,2000,"inter alia, aggressive separatism and religious",UNGD
RUS,2000,"extremism, illicit arms trafficking and organized crime.",UNGD
RUS,2000,Such an abhorrent manifestation of extremism as,UNGD
RUS,2000,international terrorism poses a direct threat to security,UNGD
RUS,2000,"and stability. Today, terrorists of every stripe",UNGD
RUS,2000,sometimes act in a more organized fashion than does,UNGD
RUS,2000,the world community confronting them. We expect that,UNGD
RUS,2000,the United Nations will step up its mobilization of,UNGD
RUS,2000,international capacities to counteract terrorism. Such,UNGD
RUS,2000,cooperation must be based on the clear principles set,UNGD
RUS,2000,forth in the Security Council resolution 1269 (1999):,UNGD
RUS,2000,"no support whatsoever, no safe havens for terrorists,",UNGD
RUS,2000,the inevitability of punishment for every terrorist act.,UNGD
RUS,2000,As to those who violate these principles the Security,UNGD
RUS,2000,Council must be ready to take measures against them,UNGD
RUS,2000,provided for in the United Nations Charter.,UNGD
RUS,2000,8,UNGD
RUS,2000,,UNGD
RUS,2000,Russia intends to ratify the Convention for the,UNGD
RUS,2000,Suppression of Terrorist Financing elaborated under,UNGD
RUS,2000,United Nations auspices. There is an urgent need to,UNGD
RUS,2000,complete work on the convention for the suppression of,UNGD
RUS,2000,"acts of nuclear terrorism, and that work on a",UNGD
RUS,2000,comprehensive anti-terrorism convention should be,UNGD
RUS,2000,stepped up.,UNGD
RUS,2000,Terrorism is often closely linked with drug,UNGD
RUS,2000,trafficking and organized crime. We welcome the,UNGD
RUS,2000,completion of the development of an international,UNGD
RUS,2000,convention against organized crime. Russia intends to,UNGD
RUS,2000,sign it in the nearest future. We also support the,UNGD
RUS,2000,proposal on drafting an international convention on the,UNGD
RUS,2000,fight against corruption.,UNGD
RUS,2000,Strategic stability means promoting human rights,UNGD
RUS,2000,and freedoms everywhere. This area is an important,UNGD
RUS,2000,component of the United Nations activities aimed at,UNGD
RUS,2000,establishing a new world order based on international,UNGD
RUS,2000,law.,UNGD
RUS,2000,Russia contributes significantly to strengthening,UNGD
RUS,2000,the universal legal regime. Our country has signed the,UNGD
RUS,2000,Statute of the International Criminal Court.,UNGD
RUS,2000,Speaking of pooling the efforts of States to,UNGD
RUS,2000,resolve the twofold task of maintaining international,UNGD
RUS,2000,"security and ensuring human security, human rights and",UNGD
RUS,2000,"freedoms, we should constantly bear in mind that in the",UNGD
RUS,2000,twentieth century the rule of the ideology of racial,UNGD
RUS,2000,hatred cost mankind scores of millions of human lives.,UNGD
RUS,2000,"Unfortunately, today, 55 years after the great victory it",UNGD
RUS,2000,is still premature to speak of total eradication of the,UNGD
RUS,2000,bacillus of national superiority.,UNGD
RUS,2000,We cannot accept a situation in which people do,UNGD
RUS,2000,"not have the right to use their mother tongue, are",UNGD
RUS,2000,deprived of their citizenship and jobs on ethnic,UNGD
RUS,2000,"grounds, when fighters against fascism are put behind",UNGD
RUS,2000,bars while former fascists find favour with the,UNGD
RUS,2000,authorities. The Organization for Security and,UNGD
RUS,2000,"Cooperation in Europe, the Council of Europe and the",UNGD
RUS,2000,United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights,UNGD
RUS,2000,should firmly respond to all such manifestations.,UNGD
RUS,2000,Strategic stability must be based on a solid,UNGD
RUS,2000,material foundation. The twenty-first century will go,UNGD
RUS,2000,down in history as the century of mankind's,UNGD
RUS,2000,breakthrough to a qualitatively new level of,UNGD
RUS,2000,development only if we manage to preserve peace and,UNGD
RUS,2000,international security and at the same time impart,UNGD
RUS,2000,necessary dynamism and depth to the process of,UNGD
RUS,2000,economic and technological equalization between the,UNGD
RUS,2000,enormous number of developing countries and the,UNGD
RUS,2000,comparatively small group of leading countries. This,UNGD
RUS,2000,goal cannot be achieved overnight. This will require —,UNGD
RUS,2000,under the unifying and guiding hand of the United,UNGD
RUS,2000,Nations — a mechanism for collective democratic,UNGD
RUS,2000,"management of the international monetary, trade and",UNGD
RUS,2000,economic systems. They must become more rational,UNGD
RUS,2000,and fair and be targeted against poverty and,UNGD
RUS,2000,underdevelopment.,UNGD
RUS,2000,It is important to make the most of those,UNGD
RUS,2000,opportunities which have been opened up by the new,UNGD
RUS,2000,technological revolution in order to initiate the process,UNGD
RUS,2000,of bridging the gap in the levels of development.,UNGD
RUS,2000,Information and communications technologies whose,UNGD
RUS,2000,potential for speeding up global development is only,UNGD
RUS,2000,comparable to the invention of written language can,UNGD
RUS,2000,serve as a driving force of that process. A chance has,UNGD
RUS,2000,emerged to skip over several traditional stages of,UNGD
RUS,2000,development through the introduction of global,UNGD
RUS,2000,computer literacy and information technologies.,UNGD
RUS,2000,"Mankind, equipped with this powerful instrument, will",UNGD
RUS,2000,obtain a real opportunity to begin creating conditions,UNGD
RUS,2000,for a decent life and the all-around development of,UNGD
RUS,2000,human beings everywhere on earth.,UNGD
RUS,2000,Strategic stability means the preservation of a,UNGD
RUS,2000,clean and healthy environment for the present and,UNGD
RUS,2000,future generations. The United Nations has done a,UNGD
RUS,2000,great deal to mobilize international efforts in that,UNGD
RUS,2000,"important field. The “Rio+10” Forum, to be held in",UNGD
RUS,2000,"2002, will provide an opportunity not only to sum up",UNGD
RUS,2000,the results of those activities but also to outline a,UNGD
RUS,2000,future-oriented follow-up programme.,UNGD
RUS,2000,Russia supports the expansion of international,UNGD
RUS,2000,cooperation within the United Nations framework in,UNGD
RUS,2000,"the areas of biodiversity, climate, combating",UNGD
RUS,2000,"desertification, as well as of forest preservation.",UNGD
RUS,2000,The recent increase over the last few years in the,UNGD
RUS,2000,number of natural and man-made disasters and the,UNGD
RUS,2000,consequent growth of the scope of human and material,UNGD

RUS,2000,formidable global challenges facing mankind. While,UNGD
RUS,2000,intensifying the United Nations efforts to promote,UNGD
RUS,2000,"international cooperation in this field, special attention",UNGD
RUS,2000,must be paid to the use of state-of-the-art specialized,UNGD

RUS,2000,The United Nations — a unique universal forum,UNGD

RUS,2000,stability. Russia welcomes the consensus reached at the,UNGD
RUS,2000,Millennium Summit on consolidating the United,UNGD

RUS,2001,taking place in the shadow of an unprecedented,UNGD
RUS,2001,challenge to humanity posed by international terrorism.,UNGD
RUS,2001,We all must seriously analyse how this could have,UNGD
RUS,2001,"happened. However, it has already become perfectly",UNGD
RUS,2001,clear today that the period of globalization and the,UNGD
RUS,2001,threats and challenges to international and regional,UNGD
RUS,2001,security that it brings with it make it urgent for of all of,UNGD
RUS,2001,us to take fundamentally new approaches to,UNGD
RUS,2001,international affairs.,UNGD
RUS,2001,"We face a tough dilemma, whose solution will",UNGD
RUS,2001,truly be of paramount importance. Either we work,UNGD
RUS,2001,together to responsibly construct a genuinely just and,UNGD
RUS,2001,democratic world order that can guarantee equal,UNGD
RUS,2001,security and sustainable development for all States in,UNGD
RUS,2001,"the world, or we show ourselves to be unable to",UNGD
RUS,2001,counter real threats to global stability and security.,UNGD
RUS,2001,The most important task of the international,UNGD
RUS,2001,community today is to create a global system to,UNGD
RUS,2001,"counteract new threats and challenges, first and",UNGD
RUS,2001,foremost among which is international terrorism. This,UNGD
RUS,2001,topic was the focus of negotiations between the,UNGD
RUS,2001,"President of the Russian Federation, Mr. Vladimir V.",UNGD
RUS,2001,"Putin, and the President of the United States of",UNGD
RUS,2001,"America, Mr. George W. Bush, which recently took",UNGD
RUS,2001,"place in Washington, D.C. and Crawford, Texas.",UNGD
RUS,2001,A universal anti-terrorist coalition has been,UNGD
RUS,2001,formed. The Russian Federation is a responsible,UNGD
RUS,2001,participant in this coalition. The creation of this,UNGD
RUS,2001,coalition has involved the United Nations playing a,UNGD
RUS,2001,very important role in consolidating and coordinating,UNGD
RUS,2001,activities. It is precisely the United Nations that has the,UNGD
RUS,2001,necessary universal character and authority to organize,UNGD
RUS,2001,a response to the threats and challenges that confront,UNGD
RUS,2001,mankind today.,UNGD
RUS,2001,The broad decisions taken by the Security,UNGD
RUS,2001,Council and the General Assembly create a solid,UNGD
RUS,2001,political and legal framework for efforts to neutralize,UNGD
RUS,2001,the threat of terrorism. It is now important for these,UNGD
RUS,2001,decisions to be implemented by all States.,UNGD
RUS,2001,"If necessary, the use of the most decisive means",UNGD
RUS,2001,"against terrorists may be permissible, including the use",UNGD
RUS,2001,of military force. The Charter grants that right. At the,UNGD
RUS,2001,"same time, this threat cannot be overcome by force",UNGD
RUS,2001,alone. A comprehensive approach to eradicating,UNGD
RUS,2001,terrorism would imply the use of the whole range of,UNGD
RUS,2001,"political, economic, financial and humanitarian",UNGD
RUS,2001,measures.,UNGD
RUS,2001,The consolidation of the international legal,UNGD
RUS,2001,framework for combating terrorism is now on our,UNGD
RUS,2001,agenda. It is extremely important to rapidly complete,UNGD
RUS,2001,and adopt the comprehensive convention on,UNGD
RUS,2001,international terrorism and a convention for the,UNGD
RUS,2001,suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism.,UNGD
RUS,2001,It would be of great importance to establish,UNGD
RUS,2001,within the United Nations a mechanism to monitor the,UNGD
RUS,2001,fulfilment by States of their treaty obligations,UNGD
RUS,2001,concerning the suppression of terrorism.,UNGD
RUS,2001,"We consider promising the idea to establish,",UNGD
RUS,2001,"under the aegis of the United Nations, a centre for",UNGD
RUS,2001,coordinating assistance to States to resolve crises,UNGD
RUS,2001,caused by terrorist acts. Such a structure could focus on,UNGD
RUS,2001,providing consultative and material and technical,UNGD
RUS,2001,support in managing the consequences of terrorist acts.,UNGD
RUS,2001,The Russian Federation also proposes studying,UNGD
RUS,2001,the possibility of including in international law the,UNGD
RUS,2001,5,UNGD
RUS,2001,,UNGD
RUS,2001,principle of the responsibility of States for their failure,UNGD
RUS,2001,to take measures against terrorists in their territory or,UNGD
RUS,2001,under their jurisdiction.,UNGD
RUS,2001,Of key importance in the success of the,UNGD
RUS,2001,comprehensive fight against international terrorism is,UNGD
RUS,2001,the maintenance and strengthening of strategic stability,UNGD
RUS,2001,at both global and regional levels and strengthening the,UNGD
RUS,2001,non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.,UNGD
RUS,2001,The focus of the international community should,UNGD
RUS,2001,continue to be on the interdependence and merging of,UNGD
RUS,2001,"international terrorism, drug trafficking and",UNGD
RUS,2001,transnational organized crime. The Russian Federation,UNGD
RUS,2001,favours the rapid entry into force of the International,UNGD
RUS,2001,Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of,UNGD
RUS,2001,Terrorism and the United Nations Convention Against,UNGD
RUS,2001,Transnational Organized Crime and its additional,UNGD
RUS,2001,protocols.,UNGD
RUS,2001,It is perfectly clear that the fight against terrorism,UNGD
RUS,2001,"is not aimed at any particular religion, civilization or",UNGD
RUS,2001,culture. This was clearly demonstrated by the,UNGD
RUS,2001,discussions on the dialogue among civilizations during,UNGD
RUS,2001,the current session of the General Assembly. We also,UNGD
RUS,2001,hope that a practical contribution in this area can be,UNGD
RUS,2001,made by the implementation of the initiative put,UNGD
RUS,2001,forward by Islamic religious leaders from the Russian,UNGD
RUS,2001,Federation to organize an international conference,UNGD
RUS,2001,entitled “Islam against terrorism” in Moscow.,UNGD
RUS,2001,Terrorism is rooted in the gap between affluence,UNGD
RUS,2001,"and poverty, both within States and in the international",UNGD
RUS,2001,"arena. Thus, the task now, as never before, is to ensure",UNGD
RUS,2001,sustainable development throughout the world and to,UNGD
RUS,2001,ensure that the social aspects of the globalization,UNGD
RUS,2001,process are addressed.,UNGD
RUS,2001,The United Nations and its specialized agencies,UNGD
RUS,2001,can do a lot to ensure effective rejection of extremism,UNGD
RUS,2001,of all forms. We suggest that thought should be given,UNGD
RUS,2001,"to organizing, under the aegis of the United Nations, a",UNGD
RUS,2001,world forum that would discuss what contribution civil,UNGD
RUS,2001,"society and, particularly, the mass media could make to",UNGD
RUS,2001,combating terrorism.,UNGD
RUS,2001,International experience has shown that,UNGD
RUS,2001,successful prevention and settlement of regional,UNGD
RUS,2001,conflicts are an integral part of the counter-terrorist,UNGD
RUS,2001,efforts of the international community. This is yet,UNGD
RUS,2001,another compelling argument in favour of further,UNGD
RUS,2001,developing and ensuring greater effectiveness of,UNGD
RUS,2001,United Nations preventive and peacekeeping activities.,UNGD
RUS,2001,"In particular, the Russian Federation advocates the",UNGD
RUS,2001,development within the United Nations of a,UNGD
RUS,2001,comprehensive strategy aimed at reliably blocking,UNGD
RUS,2001,channels for outside fuelling of the conflicts.,UNGD
RUS,2001,We need to ensure that there is regional,UNGD
RUS,2001,cooperation in fighting these new threats. An example,UNGD
RUS,2001,of such successful cooperation is that of the,UNGD
RUS,2001,"Commonwealth of Independent States, under the",UNGD
RUS,2001,auspices of which a CIS anti-terrorist centre has been,UNGD
RUS,2001,set up and is working effectively.,UNGD
RUS,2001,"Today, the moment of truth has arrived for each",UNGD
RUS,2001,of us. The Russian Federation is in favour of the,UNGD

RUS,2002,together of States to achieve common goals ,UNGD
RUS,2002,unprecedented since the Second World War  is clear,UNGD

RUS,2002,a country that international terrorists of various,UNGD

RUS,2002,millennium.,UNGD
RUS,2002,The United Nations must certainly be a pivotal,UNGD
RUS,2002,"element of such a mechanism. Indeed, the United",UNGD
RUS,2002,"Nations is called upon to continue to guarantee that, in",UNGD
RUS,2002,"combating new threats and challenges, the efforts of",UNGD
RUS,2002,20,UNGD
RUS,2002,,UNGD
RUS,2002,the international community rest on a solid basis of,UNGD
RUS,2002,international law.,UNGD
RUS,2002,We must acknowledge  and the past year has,UNGD
RUS,2002,been very instructive in this regard  that a great deal,UNGD
RUS,2002,of hard work awaits us. It will be possible to put,UNGD
RUS,2002,insurmountable obstacles in the way of fanatics and,UNGD
RUS,2002,extremists who spread death and destruction only if we,UNGD
RUS,2002,can reach general agreement on core issues relating to,UNGD
RUS,2002,"the world order. In this context, the role of the United",UNGD
RUS,2002,"Nations is, indeed, irreplaceable.",UNGD
RUS,2002,The fact that the process of implementing the,UNGD
RUS,2002,fundamental anti-terrorist resolution  Security,UNGD
RUS,2002,Council resolution 1373 (2001)  is under way is of,UNGD
RUS,2002,critical importance. That resolution is binding on all,UNGD
RUS,2002,"States, and we must now seek to achieve its",UNGD
RUS,2002,unconditional implementation by all States.,UNGD
RUS,2002,A priority task in the war on terrorism is the,UNGD
RUS,2002,strengthening of its international legal framework. First,UNGD
RUS,2002,"and foremost, there is a need to ensure the genuinely",UNGD
RUS,2002,universal character of existing anti-terrorist,UNGD
RUS,2002,conventions.,UNGD
RUS,2002,Having ratified the 1999 Convention for the,UNGD
RUS,2002,"Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, Russia is",UNGD
RUS,2002,now completing the process of accession to those,UNGD
RUS,2002,"international instruments. At the same time, we are",UNGD
RUS,2002,seriously concerned about the lack of real progress in,UNGD
RUS,2002,negotiating a comprehensive convention on combating,UNGD
RUS,2002,terrorism and a convention on the suppression of acts,UNGD
RUS,2002,of nuclear terrorism.,UNGD
RUS,2002,The well-known differences in the approaches of,UNGD
RUS,2002,States to the provisions of such instruments could,UNGD
RUS,2002,certainly be fully reconciled. They should not,UNGD
RUS,2002,"overshadow the objective, which is pressing for all of",UNGD
RUS,2002,"us, of establishing a legal basis to counter terrorism in",UNGD
RUS,2002,all its manifestations  a basis that would be in,UNGD
RUS,2002,keeping with the realities of today's world. Russia is,UNGD
RUS,2002,continuing to make resolute efforts to achieve that,UNGD
RUS,2002,objective.,UNGD
RUS,2002,It is the obligation of all States to protect the,UNGD
RUS,2002,"rights and freedoms of their citizens, the most",UNGD
RUS,2002,important of these being the right to life. But it is,UNGD
RUS,2002,precisely the lives of ordinary people that are,UNGD
RUS,2002,"threatened by terrorists, and each year new names are",UNGD
RUS,2002,added to the list of victims. The international,UNGD
RUS,2002,community can no longer tolerate this. It is our,UNGD
RUS,2002,obligation to provide our citizens with the right to,UNGD
RUS,2002,reliable protection against terrorism.,UNGD
RUS,2002,Such an objective can be achieved only if all,UNGD
RUS,2002,States agree on a range of specific measures under,UNGD
RUS,2002,United Nations auspices. There is now a need to draw,UNGD
RUS,2002,up an effective code to protect human rights against,UNGD
RUS,2002,terrorism. Some of these measures have already been,UNGD
RUS,2002,"discussed by the international community, including in",UNGD
RUS,2002,this forum. Others will require consideration in a,UNGD
RUS,2002,"broader context. The most important consideration,",UNGD
RUS,2002,"however, is that we should agree on a unified system of",UNGD
RUS,2002,values and measures shared by all States.,UNGD
RUS,2002,The results of the war against terrorism will be,UNGD
RUS,2002,"tangible only if we act in concert at all levels  global,",UNGD
RUS,2002,regional and national. The anti-terrorist cooperation,UNGD
RUS,2002,mechanisms aimed at preventing the spread of,UNGD
RUS,2002,"terrorism in Central Asia, including those within the",UNGD
RUS,2002,framework of the Commonwealth of Independent,UNGD
RUS,2002,"States and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, are",UNGD
RUS,2002,gaining momentum and thus provide clear evidence of,UNGD
RUS,2002,that fact. There is a great deal of potential in the new,UNGD
RUS,2002,partnership between Russia and the countries of the,UNGD
RUS,2002,North Atlantic Treaty Organization.,UNGD
RUS,2002,The field of anti-terrorism is an integral part of,UNGD
RUS,2002,our continuous dialogue and cooperation with the,UNGD
RUS,2002,"leading countries of the world, including the United",UNGD
RUS,2002,"States, China, India and the States members of the",UNGD
RUS,2002,European Union. We are confident that the,UNGD
RUS,2002,development of such interaction at many levels will,UNGD
RUS,2002,"promote a climate of confidence, security and",UNGD
RUS,2002,cooperation in all parts of the world.,UNGD
RUS,2002,The stability and credibility of the emerging,UNGD
RUS,2002,international system of the twenty-first century will,UNGD
RUS,2002,depend directly on the maintenance and strengthening,UNGD
RUS,2002,of strategic stability. This fundamental objective was,UNGD
RUS,2002,"advanced by the signing, by the Presidents of Russia",UNGD
RUS,2002,"and of the United States, at their May meeting in",UNGD
RUS,2002,"Moscow, of the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty,",UNGD
RUS,2002,"which was a specific, major contribution by the leading",UNGD
RUS,2002,nuclear Powers to nuclear disarmament.,UNGD
RUS,2002,It is also very important to ensure the non-,UNGD
RUS,2002,proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The,UNGD
RUS,2002,"danger of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons or",UNGD
RUS,2002,their components falling into the irresponsible hands of,UNGD
RUS,2002,terrorists increases international terrorism's potential to,UNGD
RUS,2002,cause devastation. This means that there is a need to,UNGD
RUS,2002,step up efforts to strengthen the non-proliferation,UNGD
RUS,2002,regime for weapons of mass destruction and their,UNGD
RUS,2002,delivery vehicles.,UNGD
RUS,2002,21,UNGD
RUS,2002,,UNGD
RUS,2002,"By acting jointly and responsibly, we have",UNGD
RUS,2002,already achieved a great deal. When we speak about,UNGD
RUS,2002,the establishment of new regimes for the non-,UNGD
RUS,2002,proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and for,UNGD
RUS,2002,"arms control, we by no means wish to imply a",UNGD
RUS,2002,renunciation of regimes and agreements already in,UNGD
RUS,2002,effect. They are our shared protective mechanism  a,UNGD
RUS,2002,mechanism that is very reliable and has stood the test,UNGD
RUS,2002,of time. Unjustified removal of the key elements of the,UNGD
RUS,2002,international legal framework of non-proliferation can,UNGD
RUS,2002,aggravate the international military and strategic,UNGD
RUS,2002,situation and undermine global security.,UNGD
RUS,2002,"Furthermore, we should universalize' the most",UNGD
RUS,2002,important agreements on non-proliferation of nuclear,UNGD
RUS,2002,weapons and on comprehensive nuclear test ban. The,UNGD
RUS,2002,missile sphere needs a sustainable negotiating process,UNGD
RUS,2002,aimed at concluding an international arrangement on a,UNGD
RUS,2002,global regime of missile and missile technology non-,UNGD
RUS,2002,proliferation.,UNGD
RUS,2002,The prevention of the deployment of weapons in,UNGD
RUS,2002,outer space forms an integral part of the non-,UNGD
RUS,2002,proliferation process. Together with a number of our,UNGD
RUS,2002,partners we suggest that a comprehensive agreement be,UNGD
RUS,2002,worked out aimed at preserving outer space as a zone,UNGD
RUS,2002,free from any kind of weapons. We are confident that,UNGD
RUS,2002,"this proposal serves the interests of all States, and",UNGD
RUS,2002,expect that it will enjoy wide support.,UNGD
RUS,2002,"Since its establishment, the United Nations has",UNGD
RUS,2002,been engaged in the settlement of regional conflicts.,UNGD
RUS,2002,Those so-called local problems have long turned into,UNGD
RUS,2002,one of the main threats to international stability.,UNGD
RUS,2002,"Terrorism, political extremism, and economic and",UNGD
RUS,2002,social degradation are their customary companions.,UNGD
RUS,2002,"Certainly, the primary responsibility in any settlement",UNGD
RUS,2002,"rests with the relevant parties, but multilateral",UNGD
RUS,2002,mechanisms have also repeatedly demonstrated their,UNGD
RUS,2002,effectiveness in the restoration of peace and concord. A,UNGD
RUS,2002,tangible progress made with the United Nations visible,UNGD
RUS,2002,involvement in the post-Taliban reconstruction of,UNGD
RUS,2002,Afghanistan is one of our common accomplishments.,UNGD
RUS,2002,We can add to this the adoption by the United Nations,UNGD
RUS,2002,Security Council of major practical decisions in,UNGD
RUS,2002,support of a comprehensive settlement in the Middle,UNGD
RUS,2002,East and the resolution of crises in a number of African,UNGD
RUS,2002,countries.,UNGD
RUS,2002,"And yet, we are still far from a radical decrease in",UNGD
RUS,2002,the number and intensity of armed conflicts. Hard,UNGD
RUS,2002,"work, requiring great human as well as material and",UNGD
RUS,2002,"financial resources, is awaiting us. But the most",UNGD
RUS,2002,important here is the presence of a strong political will,UNGD
RUS,2002,to implement the provisions of the United Nations,UNGD
RUS,2002,Charter pertaining to the peaceful settlement of,UNGD
RUS,2002,disputes.,UNGD
RUS,2002,Experience shows that no matter how complex,UNGD
RUS,2002,"international crises and conflicts may be, whatever",UNGD
RUS,2002,"challenges and threats they may be fraught with, they",UNGD
RUS,2002,can be settled with the aid of United Nations,UNGD
RUS,2002,instruments and on the basis of international law. This,UNGD
RUS,2002,"fully applies to the situation around Iraq, which has",UNGD
RUS,2002,long required political settlement in strict compliance,UNGD
RUS,2002,with the Security Council resolutions.,UNGD
RUS,2002,The entire international community benefits from,UNGD
RUS,2002,a steady enhancement of the leading role of our,UNGD
RUS,2002,Organization in peacemaking. We cannot relax our,UNGD
RUS,2002,attention to this task.,UNGD
RUS,2002,"At all times and throughout the world, terrorism",UNGD
RUS,2002,and extremism have tried to justify themselves with,UNGD
RUS,2002,continuous social and economic instability and poverty.,UNGD
RUS,2002,While recognizing the existence of these serious,UNGD
RUS,2002,problems we should state most resolutely that terrorism,UNGD
RUS,2002,does not and will not have any justification. At the,UNGD
RUS,2002,"same time, the creation of a sustainable and fair global",UNGD
RUS,2002,"financial and economic structure would, certainly, help",UNGD
RUS,2002,combat many dangerous challenges to mankind. The,UNGD
RUS,2002,latest major international forums  the International,UNGD
RUS,2002,Conference on Financing for Development,UNGD
RUS,2002,"in Monterey, World Food Summit in Rome,",UNGD
RUS,2002,World Summit on Sustainable Development in,UNGD
RUS,2002,Johannesburg  adopted decisions designed to uproot,UNGD
RUS,2002,the causes of the most threatening disparities in the,UNGD
RUS,2002,world. The next step is to implement the agreements,UNGD
RUS,2002,we have reached.,UNGD
RUS,2002,Equally sweeping are the tasks that face us in the,UNGD
RUS,2002,field of environmental protection. Natural disasters that,UNGD
RUS,2002,afflicted many regions of our planet this summer have,UNGD
RUS,2002,demonstrated again that the solution of environmental,UNGD
RUS,2002,issues cannot be put off unless we want to endanger the,UNGD
RUS,2002,very survival of future generations. This sphere also,UNGD
RUS,2002,depends on multilateral efforts that exclude the egoism,UNGD
RUS,2002,of individual States.,UNGD
RUS,2002,The initiative of Russian President Vladimir V.,UNGD
RUS,2002,Putin on holding in autumn 2003 a World Conference,UNGD
RUS,2002,on Climate Change in Moscow is designed to,UNGD
RUS,2002,coordinate our efforts in this field.,UNGD
RUS,2002,22,UNGD
RUS,2002,,UNGD
RUS,2002,"A year ago, the Russian Federation called on the",UNGD
RUS,2002,international community from the podium of the,UNGD
RUS,2002,United Nations General Assembly to create a global,UNGD
RUS,2002,system of counteraction to present-day threats and,UNGD
RUS,2002,challenges that would be aimed at tackling real issues,UNGD
RUS,2002,in the sphere of security and at meeting the vital,UNGD
RUS,2002,interests of each and every State. This system would,UNGD
RUS,2002,provide for long-term international stability and,UNGD
RUS,2002,sustainable development.,UNGD
RUS,2002,"To be efficient, such a system needs a generally",UNGD
RUS,2002,recognized coordinating centre capable of rallying the,UNGD
RUS,2002,international community. And we do have such a,UNGD
RUS,2002,centre  the United Nations with its unique,UNGD
RUS,2002,"legitimacy, universality and experience. Our common",UNGD
RUS,2002,task is to unite around the United Nations to provide it,UNGD
RUS,2002,with the necessary potential and resources and to,UNGD
RUS,2002,develop as much as possible its internal reserves.,UNGD
RUS,2002,"Today, we can state with satisfaction that the",UNGD
RUS,2002,global system is already evolving and the beginning of,UNGD
RUS,2002,this process is largely successful. We suggest that an,UNGD
RUS,2002,additional impetus should be given to this process and,UNGD
RUS,2002,a resolution to encourage a most prompt creation of a,UNGD
RUS,2002,global system of counteraction to present-day threats,UNGD
RUS,2002,and challenges should be adopted at this session of the,UNGD
RUS,2002,"General Assembly. By doing so, we will direct all",UNGD
RUS,2002,States towards the joint elaboration of its general shape,UNGD
RUS,2002,and parameters. This is even more relevant because,UNGD
RUS,2002,some of its parameters are already visible.,UNGD
RUS,2002,It is apparent that the system to be created must,UNGD
RUS,2002,be:,UNGD
RUS,2002,"ñ Global, as modern challenges in the context of",UNGD
RUS,2002,"globalization pose a universal threat, and should",UNGD
RUS,2002,be addressed at the global level.,UNGD
RUS,2002,"ñ Comprehensive in scope, as each of the modern",UNGD
RUS,2002,threats bears a huge destructive potential and all,UNGD
RUS,2002,such problems without exceptions should be,UNGD
RUS,2002,embraced by the system.,UNGD
RUS,2002,"ñ Holistic in approach, as quite often the new",UNGD
RUS,2002,threats and challenges are directly interrelated.,UNGD
RUS,2002,ñ Universal in participation.,UNGD
RUS,2002,"Finally, the system should become a reflection of",UNGD
RUS,2002,"the international rule of law, as its power will be built",UNGD
RUS,2002,"on principles and regulations of international law, the",UNGD
RUS,2002,United Nations Charter above all.,UNGD
RUS,2002,We bear grave responsibility to future,UNGD
RUS,2002,"generations, and the model of world order we will",UNGD
RUS,2002,establish is destined to influence the life on our planet,UNGD
RUS,2002,"for decades. As for Russia, we have made our choice.",UNGD
RUS,2002,"This is the choice in favour of a democratic, multi-",UNGD
RUS,2002,"polar world order, which would guarantee sustainable",UNGD
RUS,2002,development and equal security for all States; a world,UNGD
RUS,2002,order formed on the basis of the extensive structure of,UNGD
RUS,2002,multilateral institutions integrated within the,UNGD
RUS,2002,framework of the United Nations.,UNGD
RUS,2002,We hope that the decisions of this General,UNGD
RUS,2002,Assembly session will mark an important stage of this,UNGD
RUS,2002,process.,UNGD
RUS,2002,,UNGD
RUS,2002,,UNGD
RUS,2002,,UNGD
RUS,2003,"Once again,",UNGD
RUS,2003,I am delighted to have this opportunity to address this,UNGD
RUS,2003,"representative audience. At the outset, however, I",UNGD
RUS,2003,should like to wish the fifty-eighth session of the,UNGD
RUS,2003,General Assembly fruitful work — work to,UNGD
RUS,2003,successfully harmonize the actions of peoples and,UNGD
RUS,2003,"States; work on behalf of peace, security and progress.",UNGD
RUS,2003,Those purposes were set out in the Charter of the,UNGD
RUS,2003,"United Nations by our predecessors, but, as we can see,",UNGD
RUS,2003,"they are still relevant. Even now, they provide a solid,",UNGD
RUS,2003,long-term foundation for the activities of the United,UNGD
RUS,2003,"Nations. And, although the structure and the functions",UNGD
RUS,2003,of the Organization took shape in an international,UNGD
RUS,2003,"environment fundamentally different from ours, time",UNGD
RUS,2003,"has only reaffirmed their universal importance. Today,",UNGD
RUS,2003,the instruments of the United Nations are not merely in,UNGD
RUS,2003,"demand; they are, as life itself has shown, simply",UNGD
RUS,2003,irreplaceable in crucial situations.,UNGD
RUS,2003,That has been made abundantly clear by the,UNGD
RUS,2003,following important fact: despite sharp differences,UNGD
RUS,2003,"concerning how to resolve the Iraq crisis, the situation",UNGD
RUS,2003,is ultimately returning to the legal sphere of the United,UNGD
RUS,2003,Nations. Russia’s position in that regard is consistent,UNGD
RUS,2003,and clear. Only direct United Nations participation in,UNGD
RUS,2003,Iraq’s reconstruction will enable Iraq’s people to decide,UNGD
RUS,2003,their future. And only with active and — I want to stress,UNGD
RUS,2003,this — practical United Nations assistance in Iraq’s,UNGD
RUS,2003,economic and civil transformation will Iraq assume a,UNGD
RUS,2003,truly new and worthy place in the world community.,UNGD
RUS,2003,"It is clear that, in recent years, the United Nations",UNGD
RUS,2003,has increasingly been obliged to carry out,UNGD
RUS,2003,fundamentally new tasks and to tackle threats that are,UNGD
RUS,2003,"different from, but just as serious as, those it faced",UNGD
RUS,2003,"before. Three years ago, at the 2000 Millennium",UNGD
RUS,2003,"Summit, I said here that the common enemy of the",UNGD
RUS,2003,United Nations was terrorism. Was Russia’s voice,UNGD
RUS,2003,heeded then? Did everyone understand the seriousness,UNGD
RUS,2003,"of the threat, and were our joint actions adequate? The",UNGD
RUS,2003,"events of 11 September proved that, unfortunately, they",UNGD
RUS,2003,were not.,UNGD
RUS,2003,"To us in Russia, however, the style of the",UNGD
RUS,2003,"murderers who committed terrorist acts in Moscow, in",UNGD
RUS,2003,"Chechnya and elsewhere in Russia and in New York, as",UNGD
RUS,2003,"well as against United Nations staff in Baghdad, has",UNGD
RUS,2003,long been painfully familiar. That style is identical,UNGD
RUS,2003,"everywhere, and the fact that the inciters of terror are",UNGD
RUS,2003,easily recognizable — with regard to both the events of,UNGD
RUS,2003,August this year and the terrorist attacks of previous,UNGD
RUS,2003,years — only attests to the global nature of this threat.,UNGD
RUS,2003,It is true that now we are listening to one another.,UNGD
RUS,2003,And we understand that the United Nations must,UNGD
RUS,2003,become — and is indeed becoming — the basis for a,UNGD
RUS,2003,"global anti-terrorist coalition. Here, I wish to take",UNGD
RUS,2003,particular note of the Security Council’s Counter-,UNGD
RUS,2003,Terrorism Committee. Terrorism is a challenge to the,UNGD
RUS,2003,"planet’s security and to its economic future. Therefore,",UNGD
RUS,2003,the Committee must become a real and practical,UNGD
RUS,2003,instrument for effectively fighting the terrorist threat.,UNGD
RUS,2003,I should like to focus in particular on the,UNGD
RUS,2003,humanitarian activities of the United Nations. That area,UNGD
RUS,2003,"consumes the lion’s share of the Organization’s energy,",UNGD
RUS,2003,"time and resources, but it does not always appear in the",UNGD
RUS,2003,"headlines, nor is it always familiar to the citizens of the",UNGD
RUS,2003,more prosperous States. But it is precisely that area of,UNGD
RUS,2003,United Nations work that is so fundamental and,UNGD
RUS,2003,irreplaceable. The United Nations is helping millions,UNGD
RUS,2003,of destitute people throughout the world — victims of,UNGD
RUS,2003,"hunger, of disease and of conflict — to survive and not",UNGD
RUS,2003,to lose hope. That work is exceptionally important; it,UNGD
RUS,2003,lends indisputable political and moral authority to the,UNGD
RUS,2003,entire Organization. And it is here that the,UNGD
RUS,2003,interrelationship between the moral and political content,UNGD
RUS,2003,of international activities is particularly evident.,UNGD
RUS,2003,I should like to take this opportunity to thank all,UNGD
RUS,2003,"staff members of the United Nations, all non-",UNGD
RUS,2003,"governmental organizations and, of course, the many",UNGD
RUS,2003,volunteers who are participating in this noble work.,UNGD
RUS,2003,Because we understand how valuable the,UNGD
RUS,2003,"Organization’s humanitarian mission is, Russia views it",UNGD
RUS,2003,as a major political endeavour. We are already,UNGD
RUS,2003,"contributing to this work, and we are committed to",UNGD
RUS,2003,"increasing our contribution. Over the past three years,",UNGD
RUS,2003,Russia has forgiven a total of $27.2 billion in debt of,UNGD
RUS,2003,5,UNGD
RUS,2003, ,UNGD
RUS,2003,"developing countries, and we are currently granting",UNGD
RUS,2003,significant tariff preferences to such countries.,UNGD
RUS,2003,"For the first time in many years, as our country",UNGD
RUS,2003,"has grown, it has become a donor to the United Nations",UNGD
RUS,2003,World Food Programme. The horrors of starvation are,UNGD
RUS,2003,well known to us from our own history. As a result of,UNGD
RUS,2003,the civil war of the past century and the forced,UNGD
RUS,2003,"collectivization of the 1920s and 1930s, millions of",UNGD
RUS,2003,"people died of starvation in the Volga region, in Northern",UNGD
RUS,2003,Caucasus and in other parts of our country. Hunger,UNGD
RUS,2003,became a national tragedy for the peoples of Ukraine as,UNGD
RUS,2003,well. We consider it our moral and ethical duty to,UNGD
RUS,2003,expand our participation in food aid programmes.,UNGD
RUS,2003,Russia intends to work actively to resolve acute,UNGD
RUS,2003,environmental problems. A milestone will be achieved,UNGD
RUS,2003,in that area by the World Conference on Climate,UNGD
RUS,2003,"Change, scheduled to convene next week in Russia’s",UNGD
RUS,2003,"capital, Moscow. We also believe it is essential that a",UNGD
RUS,2003,global system be established to monitor and neutralize,UNGD
RUS,2003,"dangerous infectious diseases, and we consider the",UNGD
RUS,2003,work done by the Global Fund to be a real,UNGD
RUS,2003,demonstration of international solidarity in fighting the,UNGD
RUS,2003,"spread of AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.",UNGD
RUS,2003,"Of course, the United Nations, like any system",UNGD
RUS,2003,"with a complex structure, needs to be improved. But",UNGD
RUS,2003,the Organization’s past and current problems have never,UNGD
RUS,2003,been problems of only the Organization per se; they have,UNGD
RUS,2003,always been created by — and they continue to reflect —,UNGD
RUS,2003,contradictions in the very system of international,UNGD
RUS,2003,"relations, particularly the system of international law.",UNGD
RUS,2003,"After all, politicians, including those represented in the",UNGD
RUS,2003,"United Nations, including the Security Council, do not",UNGD
RUS,2003,always have at their disposal adequate and effectively,UNGD
RUS,2003,functioning legal instruments — instruments that would,UNGD
RUS,2003,enable them to deal effectively with the international and,UNGD
RUS,2003,"regional crises that arise. International law must, of",UNGD
RUS,2003,"course, be fluid and living, reflecting the realities of",UNGD
RUS,2003,the contemporary world. I believe that many of the,UNGD
RUS,2003,processes that are under way within the United Nations,UNGD
RUS,2003,also attest to the constant changes that are taking place,UNGD
RUS,2003,in the world. Such changes dictate a logic of evolution,UNGD
RUS,2003,in the United Nations.,UNGD
RUS,2003,Members of the Organization know very well,UNGD
RUS,2003,"that, as a rule, all of the achievements of the United",UNGD
RUS,2003,"Nations are shared successes, and that our failures are",UNGD
RUS,2003,"shared miscalculations. Such knowledge, however,",UNGD
RUS,2003,"brings with it great responsibility. First and foremost,",UNGD
RUS,2003,we must be extremely careful about interfering with the,UNGD
RUS,2003,fabric — the mechanisms — of the work of the United,UNGD
RUS,2003,"Nations. Clearly, behind any such decision there should",UNGD
RUS,2003,be more than general political rhetoric — mere words,UNGD
RUS,2003,about so-called fair policies.,UNGD
RUS,2003,I am convinced that any attempt to modernize,UNGD
RUS,2003,United Nations instruments must be preceded by,UNGD
RUS,2003,serious analysis and careful calculation. Such an,UNGD
RUS,2003,"approach should be taken, first and foremost, with",UNGD
RUS,2003,regard to the principal international legal instruments.,UNGD
RUS,2003,"After all, guaranteeing that they remain effective is the",UNGD
RUS,2003,only way to avoid a legal vacuum. As long as the,UNGD
RUS,2003,norms of international law remain unchanged and,UNGD
RUS,2003,"operative, we must observe them. We must ensure",UNGD
RUS,2003,continuity of security guarantees for States and for the,UNGD
RUS,2003,world as a whole.,UNGD
RUS,2003,We must analyse United Nations structures and,UNGD
RUS,2003,mechanisms and try to understand which have proved,UNGD
RUS,2003,"effective and productive, as well as which have done",UNGD
RUS,2003,the job they were intended to do and which now remain,UNGD
RUS,2003,unused. We should remember that much of the,UNGD
RUS,2003,potential of the United Nations has still to be tapped.,UNGD
RUS,2003,There are many resources that we are only now,UNGD
RUS,2003,learning how to use.,UNGD
RUS,2003,I would like in particular to comment on the need,UNGD
RUS,2003,to enhance the effectiveness of the Security Council. I,UNGD
RUS,2003,"am convinced that, given the deep-rooted nature of the",UNGD
RUS,2003,current differences of opinion and the importance of,UNGD
RUS,2003,"ensuring that the Council remain effective, we must",UNGD
RUS,2003,work gradually and very cautiously.,UNGD
RUS,2003,We believe that at this stage we should be guided,UNGD
RUS,2003,above all by the broadest possible agreement on all,UNGD
RUS,2003,"aspects of the expansion of the Council, as well as by",UNGD
RUS,2003,the need to ensure that it maintains its current high,UNGD
RUS,2003,status and the legitimacy born of agreed actions. After,UNGD
RUS,2003,"all, the Security Council, as the Charter makes clear,",UNGD
RUS,2003,acts on behalf of the United Nations. The Security,UNGD
RUS,2003,Council is endowed with a specific mechanism for,UNGD
RUS,2003,harmonizing political will and for protecting the,UNGD
RUS,2003,"national interests of a great variety of States, and,",UNGD
RUS,2003,"through this, the interests of the entire international",UNGD
RUS,2003,community.,UNGD
RUS,2003,It is true that we often hear that the developed,UNGD
RUS,2003,countries bear special responsibility for the destiny of,UNGD
RUS,2003,"the world. Such leadership, however, entails major",UNGD
RUS,2003,"obligations, primarily to ensure that the interests of the",UNGD
RUS,2003,international community as a whole are reflected.,UNGD
RUS,2003,Being a world Power means working together with the,UNGD
RUS,2003,"world community. Being a truly strong, influential",UNGD
RUS,2003,6,UNGD
RUS,2003, ,UNGD
RUS,2003,State means seeing and helping to resolve the problems,UNGD
RUS,2003,of small and economically weak countries.,UNGD
RUS,2003,"In that connection, I believe that it would be",UNGD
RUS,2003,useful to intensify the work that is being carried out by,UNGD
RUS,2003,the United Nations in cooperation with the regional,UNGD
RUS,2003,international structures. That will lead directly towards,UNGD
RUS,2003,increased economic prosperity in various parts of the,UNGD
RUS,2003,"world, and thus contribute to the containment of",UNGD
RUS,2003,potential threats and the maintenance of a common,UNGD
RUS,2003,global strategic balance.,UNGD
RUS,2003,We welcome the emergence of regional centres,UNGD
RUS,2003,for coordination and cooperation in a united Europe.,UNGD
RUS,2003,We favour the strengthening of integration processes in,UNGD
RUS,2003,"the Asia-Pacific region. And of course, we support the",UNGD
RUS,2003,work of the Commonwealth of Independent States,UNGD
RUS,2003,"(CIS), as well as that of the Collective Security Treaty",UNGD
RUS,2003,Organization and the Shanghai Cooperation,UNGD
RUS,2003,"Organization, whose authority and effectiveness are",UNGD
RUS,2003,continuing to grow.,UNGD
RUS,2003,Russia is not the only country that is interested in,UNGD
RUS,2003,regional integration. Our CIS partners have also,UNGD
RUS,2003,demonstrated their practical commitment to that same,UNGD
RUS,2003,goal. This was reaffirmed during the recent CIS,UNGD
RUS,2003,summit. We consider the development of our,UNGD
RUS,2003,"interaction with the European Union, which is",UNGD
RUS,2003,"multifaceted in nature, to be important. Likewise, with",UNGD
RUS,2003,"regard to security issues, we attach importance to the",UNGD
RUS,2003,search new forms of cooperation with the North,UNGD
RUS,2003,Atlantic Treaty Organization.,UNGD
RUS,2003,We should counter current threats to civilization,UNGD
RUS,2003,only by means of collective responses whose legitimacy,UNGD
RUS,2003,"is not in doubt. In this respect, we need a systemic vision",UNGD
RUS,2003,"that combines political with, when necessary, military",UNGD
RUS,2003,measures. Such measures should be agreed upon in,UNGD
RUS,2003,"advance, and be sensible and appropriate.",UNGD
RUS,2003,The need to improve the peacekeeping,UNGD
RUS,2003,mechanisms of the United Nations remains on the,UNGD
RUS,2003,Organization’s agenda. The United Nations must be,UNGD
RUS,2003,"able to deploy peacekeeping — and, where necessary,",UNGD
RUS,2003,peace-enforcement — operations more quickly and,UNGD
RUS,2003,"efficiently, in strict compliance with the United Nations",UNGD
RUS,2003,"Charter. I should like to note that Russia, which has",UNGD
RUS,2003,always supported the peacekeeping functions of the,UNGD
RUS,2003,"Organization, is prepared to step up its participation in",UNGD
RUS,2003,"such operations, both under United Nations auspices",UNGD
RUS,2003,and in coalition operations authorized by the Security,UNGD
RUS,2003,Council.,UNGD
RUS,2003,The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,UNGD
RUS,2003,and their delivery systems remains a serious challenge,UNGD
RUS,2003,to the modern world. The most dangerous challenge is,UNGD
RUS,2003,the possibility of their falling into the hands of,UNGD
RUS,2003,terrorists. We know what steps must be taken in order,UNGD
RUS,2003,to eliminate such threats. These include the further,UNGD
RUS,2003,universalization of the existing non-proliferation,UNGD
RUS,2003,"regimes, the strengthening of international verification",UNGD
RUS,2003,instruments and the introduction of safe technologies in,UNGD
RUS,2003,"nuclear energy production. In general, this requires the",UNGD
RUS,2003,renunciation by States of excessive arsenals and,UNGD
RUS,2003,military programmes that could undermine the political,UNGD
RUS,2003,and military balance and trigger an arms race.,UNGD
RUS,2003,Russia believes that it is extremely important to,UNGD
RUS,2003,prevent the militarization of outer space. We believe,UNGD
RUS,2003,that a comprehensive agreement should be elaborated,UNGD
RUS,2003,"on this issue, and invite all countries possessing",UNGD
RUS,2003,potential in this area to join our initiative. The Russian,UNGD
RUS,2003,"initiative to set up, under the auspices of the United",UNGD
RUS,2003,"Nations, a global system to counter these new threats has",UNGD
RUS,2003,already been supported by the General Assembly. We,UNGD
RUS,2003,propose the adoption of a new resolution during this,UNGD
RUS,2003,session setting out specific further steps in this direction.,UNGD
RUS,2003,"In conclusion, I should like to recall that the solid",UNGD
RUS,2003,structure of the United Nations has enabled it to,UNGD
RUS,2003,withstand all of the many crises of the second half of,UNGD
RUS,2003,the twentieth century. It has helped to overcome threats,UNGD
RUS,2003,"of global confrontation and, most importantly, helped",UNGD
RUS,2003,to promote human rights. It has also helped to assert,UNGD
RUS,2003,the principles of mutual respect and good-neighbourliness,UNGD
RUS,2003,among States. The main thrust of the United Nations,UNGD
RUS,2003,approach is that humankind has no alternative but to,UNGD
RUS,2003,"jointly construct a safer, fairer and more prosperous",UNGD
RUS,2003,world. That is our duty to succeeding generations. In,UNGD
RUS,2003,that important task we can have no better help than,UNGD
RUS,2003,such time-tested instruments as the work of the United,UNGD
RUS,2003,"Nations, an Organization that, for half a century, took",UNGD
RUS,2003,decisions that were crucial for the entire world.,UNGD
RUS,2003,Russia is convinced that the United Nations must,UNGD
RUS,2003,maintain its central role in international affairs. This is,UNGD
RUS,2003,"particularly relevant, and particularly important, for",UNGD
RUS,2003,resolving conflict situations. This is our choice and our,UNGD
RUS,2003,strategic position of principle.,UNGD
RUS,2003,,UNGD
RUS,2003,,UNGD
RUS,2003,,UNGD
RUS,2003,,UNGD
RUS,2003,,UNGD
RUS,2004,I am addressing the Assembly today at a most,UNGD
RUS,2004,"difficult time for our country, when tears are still being",UNGD
RUS,2004,shed by those who lost their children and loved ones,UNGD
RUS,2004,during the horrific terrorist attack in the Russian city of,UNGD
RUS,2004,Beslan. I would like from this rostrum to take this,UNGD
RUS,2004,opportunity to express once again my gratitude to all,UNGD
RUS,2004,those who have shown their solidarity with Russia in,UNGD
RUS,2004,these tragic days. Our special thanks go to the States and,UNGD
RUS,2004,international organizations that extended their helping,UNGD
RUS,2004,hand to the victims and the bereaved families ó to all,UNGD
RUS,2004,those who have suffered from this outrage.,UNGD
RUS,2004,I am also addressing the Assembly at a moment,UNGD
RUS,2004,"of truth, when there cannot possibly be any doubt",UNGD
RUS,2004,whatever remaining as to the true nature of,UNGD
RUS,2004,international terrorism and the challenge it has flung,UNGD
RUS,2004,down before the world community. With their actions,UNGD
RUS,2004,"throughout the world, the terrorists have once and for",UNGD
RUS,2004,all placed themselves in opposition to civilized,UNGD
RUS,2004,"mankind. In fact, having made the mass murder of",UNGD
RUS,2004,"people an end in itself, they have knowingly violated",UNGD
RUS,2004,all norms of human morality.,UNGD
RUS,2004,Russia has drawn harsh conclusions. They have,UNGD
RUS,2004,been set forth in the 4 and 13 September addresses by,UNGD
RUS,2004,"the President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir V.",UNGD
RUS,2004,Putin. We will not allow anyone to encroach on the,UNGD
RUS,2004,sovereignty of our State. We will resolutely strengthen,UNGD
RUS,2004,the unity of the country and its people in order to,UNGD
RUS,2004,counter terror and to guarantee a secure and decent life,UNGD
RUS,2004,for our citizens in freedom and democracy.,UNGD
RUS,2004,The measures announced by the Russian,UNGD
RUS,2004,President to achieve these objectives will be,UNGD
RUS,2004,implemented on the basis of our countryís,UNGD
RUS,2004,Constitution; and we will continue to defend our,UNGD
RUS,2004,"legitimate interests throughout the world, not through",UNGD
RUS,2004,"confrontation, but by means of equitable dialogue,",UNGD
RUS,2004,"cooperation and partnership. Moreover, a readiness to",UNGD
RUS,2004,engage in honest cooperation in fighting terrorism,UNGD
RUS,2004,"without double standards, is becoming one of the key",UNGD
RUS,2004,criteria in our relations with any and all States.,UNGD
RUS,2004,We must enter into a qualitatively new and critical,UNGD
RUS,2004,stage in the activities of the anti-terrorist coalition. The,UNGD
RUS,2004,meeting of the Security Council of 1 September,UNGD
RUS,2004,demonstrated the strong determination of the,UNGD
RUS,2004,international community to continue its fight against,UNGD
RUS,2004,terrorism in a consistent way. It is important now to,UNGD
RUS,2004,translate this commitment into practical actions as,UNGD
RUS,2004,quickly as possible.,UNGD
RUS,2004,In the three years that have passed since the,UNGD
RUS,2004,"terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington, a",UNGD
RUS,2004,lot has been done to develop effective partnership in,UNGD
RUS,2004,"this sphere. However, compared to the scale of the",UNGD
RUS,2004,"threat, far from enough has been done. It is important",UNGD
RUS,2004,to learn lessons from the experience gained and to,UNGD
RUS,2004,draw conclusions for the future.,UNGD
RUS,2004,"First, the global nature of the terrorist threat testifies",UNGD
RUS,2004,to the fact that security in todayís world is indivisible.,UNGD
RUS,2004,"Consequently, only collective responsibility can make",UNGD
RUS,2004,the world secure. The fight against terrorism should,UNGD
RUS,2004,unite States rather than pit them against each other. We,UNGD
RUS,2004,can deal with this evil only on a multilateral basis by,UNGD
RUS,2004,combining our efforts and acting in the spirit of solidarity.,UNGD
RUS,2004,"As President Putin has declared, Russia considers the",UNGD
RUS,2004,objective of strengthening the anti-terrorist coalition to,UNGD
RUS,2004,be one of our most important tasks.,UNGD
RUS,2004,A special emphasis here should be placed on,UNGD
RUS,2004,"intensifying the cooperation among our special services,",UNGD
RUS,2004,"which, we are convinced, must now be raised to a",UNGD
RUS,2004,qualitatively new level of trust and coordinated action.,UNGD
RUS,2004,"Secondly, a clear strategy and a generally",UNGD
RUS,2004,acceptable legal framework are the prerequisites for,UNGD
RUS,2004,success in combating terrorism. Such a framework is,UNGD
RUS,2004,enshrined in resolution 1373 (2001) and in other,UNGD
RUS,2004,"decisions of the Security Council. But now, additional",UNGD
RUS,2004,efforts are needed. They include making necessary,UNGD
RUS,2004,"amendments to national legislation, acceding to",UNGD
RUS,2004,international anti-terrorist conventions and finalizing,UNGD
RUS,2004,new international counter-terrorism legal instruments.,UNGD
RUS,2004,In circumstances where international terrorism,UNGD
RUS,2004,"has declared war on our entire civilization, the",UNGD
RUS,2004,determination of States to use their right of self-,UNGD
RUS,2004,defence in conformity with Article 51 of the United,UNGD
RUS,2004,Nations Charter is of particular importance. Of course,UNGD
RUS,2004,international law is clearly not an inalterable dogma.,UNGD
RUS,2004,The fight against terrorism calls for its development,UNGD
RUS,2004,and improvement.,UNGD
RUS,2004,"Thirdly, the time has come to renounce double",UNGD
RUS,2004,"standards once and for all when it comes to terror,",UNGD
RUS,2004,regardless of the slogans in which it may be cloaked.,UNGD
RUS,2004,31,UNGD
RUS,2004,,UNGD
RUS,2004,Those who slaughtered children in Beslan and hijacked,UNGD
RUS,2004,aeroplanes to attack America are creatures of the same,UNGD
RUS,2004,ilk.,UNGD
RUS,2004,"Harbouring terrorists, their henchmen and their",UNGD
RUS,2004,sponsors undermines unity and mutual trust among,UNGD
RUS,2004,"those that form part of the anti-terrorist front, serves as",UNGD
RUS,2004,justification for the actions of terrorists and indeed,UNGD
RUS,2004,encourages them to commit similar crimes in other,UNGD
RUS,2004,countries. I would recall that United Nations decisions,UNGD
RUS,2004,require States granting political asylum to carefully,UNGD
RUS,2004,examine the personal records of each individual to,UNGD
RUS,2004,make sure that he or she has no links to terrorism.,UNGD
RUS,2004,Attempts to use the fight against terrorism in various,UNGD
RUS,2004,geopolitical games are even more counterproductive,UNGD
RUS,2004,and dangerous.,UNGD
RUS,2004,"Fourth, the utter atrociousness of the recent",UNGD
RUS,2004,terrorist attacks proves there is the need for reliable,UNGD
RUS,2004,safeguards against terrorists gaining access to weapons,UNGD
RUS,2004,of mass destruction. Russia is prepared for the closest,UNGD
RUS,2004,kind of international partnership in that area. Our,UNGD
RUS,2004,country was one of the sponsors of Security Council,UNGD
RUS,2004,resolution 1540 (2004). It is a participant in the,UNGD
RUS,2004,Proliferation Security Initiative and a co-sponsor of the,UNGD
RUS,2004,Group of Eight (G-8) Action Plan on Non-,UNGD
RUS,2004,Proliferation. Those initiatives are complementary and,UNGD
RUS,2004,are designed to increase the effectiveness of the regime of,UNGD
RUS,2004,"the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,",UNGD
RUS,2004,something which is especially relevant on the eve of the,UNGD
RUS,2004,2005 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on,UNGD
RUS,2004,the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).,UNGD
RUS,2004,"Fifth, drug trafficking is increasingly interwoven",UNGD
RUS,2004,with terrorism. The drug flow from Afghanistan has,UNGD
RUS,2004,acquired global significance. The implementation of a,UNGD
RUS,2004,"set of social, economic and law-enforcement measures",UNGD
RUS,2004,both within and outside the borders of that country is,UNGD
RUS,2004,now more urgent than ever. One of the key elements of,UNGD
RUS,2004,that strategy lies in strengthening the existing anti-drug,UNGD
RUS,2004,security belts and creating new ones.,UNGD
RUS,2004,Russia is making an important contribution,UNGD
RUS,2004,"towards resolving the drug problem, including through",UNGD
RUS,2004,"the formulation of specific legal, political and",UNGD
RUS,2004,operational measures within the framework of the,UNGD
RUS,2004,Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Collective,UNGD
RUS,2004,Security Treaty Organization (CSTO). We are ready to,UNGD
RUS,2004,coordinate actions with the Government of,UNGD
RUS,2004,"Afghanistan, and with the multinational and coalition",UNGD
RUS,2004,forces operating in that country.,UNGD
RUS,2004,"Sixth, international terrorists have neither",UNGD
RUS,2004,"nationality nor religion. In fact, it is specifically",UNGD
RUS,2004,"religion and national culture that, today as never",UNGD
RUS,2004,"before, require protection from the devastating impact",UNGD
RUS,2004,of extremism of any kind. There is a need for,UNGD
RUS,2004,respectful dialogue among various religions and,UNGD
RUS,2004,"civilizations. Russia, which is open both to the West",UNGD
RUS,2004,"and to the East, is ready to play its part in that process,",UNGD
RUS,2004,which is intended to prevent a split in civilization.,UNGD
RUS,2004,Another pressing task today is the saving of,UNGD
RUS,2004,world spiritual and cultural monuments from attacks by,UNGD
RUS,2004,extremists. We deem it essential to establish,UNGD
RUS,2004,cooperation in that area between the United Nations,UNGD
RUS,2004,"and its specialized agencies, primarily the United",UNGD
RUS,2004,"Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural",UNGD
RUS,2004,Organization (UNESCO). Failing to act here ó as well,UNGD
RUS,2004,as standing by in silence at the desecration of,UNGD
RUS,2004,memorials to Second World War heroes and victims,UNGD
RUS,2004,and at attempts to rehabilitate fascists ó can only play,UNGD
RUS,2004,into the hands of those who wish to incite extremist,UNGD
RUS,2004,trends in society.,UNGD
RUS,2004,"Seventh, Russia believes that the United Nations",UNGD
RUS,2004,must continue to play a pivotal role in uniting the,UNGD
RUS,2004,efforts of the international community in its fight,UNGD
RUS,2004,against terrorism. As Chair of the Security Councilís,UNGD
RUS,2004,"Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), our country",UNGD
RUS,2004,intends to actively contribute to speeding up the reform,UNGD
RUS,2004,of that Committee. We propose drafting a new Security,UNGD
RUS,2004,Council resolution that would ensure the most effective,UNGD
RUS,2004,"possible functioning of the CTC, so as to identify, in a",UNGD
RUS,2004,"timely manner, weak links in the anti-terrorism",UNGD
RUS,2004,network and increase practical cooperation between the,UNGD
RUS,2004,"CTC and international and regional organizations,",UNGD
RUS,2004,including the Commonwealth of Independent States,UNGD
RUS,2004,"(CIS), the CSTO and the Shanghai Cooperation",UNGD
RUS,2004,Organization.,UNGD
RUS,2004,"The CIS summit held recently in Astana,",UNGD
RUS,2004,"Kazakhstan, reaffirmed the strong potential of CIS",UNGD
RUS,2004,"regional structures in all areas, from anti-terrorist",UNGD
RUS,2004,activities and ensuring collective security to,UNGD
RUS,2004,intensifying economic integration.,UNGD
RUS,2004,"Certainly, in an increasingly interdependent",UNGD
RUS,2004,"world, the war on terrorism cannot be considered in",UNGD
RUS,2004,isolation from other pressing issues facing mankind.,UNGD
RUS,2004,This is especially relevant to the settlement of,UNGD
RUS,2004,"conflicts, which for decades have been destabilizing",UNGD
RUS,2004,the situation at the regional and global levels. Through,UNGD
RUS,2004,"its decisions, the General Assembly must promote a",UNGD
RUS,2004,32,UNGD
RUS,2004,,UNGD
RUS,2004,Middle East settlement on the basis of commitments,UNGD
RUS,2004,"made by the parties under the road map. Yesterday, the",UNGD
RUS,2004,Quartet of international mediators spoke out to that end.,UNGD
RUS,2004,The situation in Iraq is a source of serious,UNGD
RUS,2004,concern. Russia is ready to render all possible,UNGD
RUS,2004,assistance towards attaining a political settlement,UNGD
RUS,2004,aimed at preserving Iraqís territorial integrity and,UNGD
RUS,2004,ensuring its political sovereignty and a genuinely,UNGD
RUS,2004,democratic post-war recovery. The search for national,UNGD
RUS,2004,"reconciliation within Iraq is of key significance; here,",UNGD
RUS,2004,the Iraqis could be assisted by the holding of an,UNGD
RUS,2004,international conference with the participation of all,UNGD
RUS,2004,"major Iraqi political forces, friendly States, Security",UNGD
RUS,2004,Council members and the League of Arab States and,UNGD
RUS,2004,other organizations.,UNGD
RUS,2004,"We must remain vigilant with regard to Kosovo,",UNGD
RUS,2004,which is a dangerous hotbed of tension. There is no,UNGD
RUS,2004,room for complacency. We must work to ensure that,UNGD
RUS,2004,universally recognized standards of human rights and,UNGD
RUS,2004,the rights of national minorities are applied in the,UNGD
RUS,2004,region. We also need to make full use of existing,UNGD
RUS,2004,mechanisms for conflict settlement within the CIS.,UNGD
RUS,2004,Consolidating the peacemaking capacity of the,UNGD
RUS,2004,international community is crucial to overcoming,UNGD
RUS,2004,regional crises. A collective response to humanitarian,UNGD
RUS,2004,"crises, in particular those on the African continent, in",UNGD
RUS,2004,full compliance with the United Nations Charter and in,UNGD
RUS,2004,"a spirit of partnership with regional structures, would",UNGD
RUS,2004,leave no doubt that the Charter remains a universal,UNGD
RUS,2004,basis for the effective solution of such problems.,UNGD
RUS,2004,The United Nations must continue to focus its,UNGD
RUS,2004,attention on other global threats to security and,UNGD
RUS,2004,sustainable development as well. Those include the,UNGD
RUS,2004,eradication of poverty and illiteracy as a breeding,UNGD
RUS,2004,"ground for extremism. Annually, our country grants",UNGD
RUS,2004,"1,000 scholarships to students from African countries.",UNGD
RUS,2004,Russia has contributed $7.5 million to the Global Fund,UNGD
RUS,2004,"to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and has",UNGD
RUS,2004,provided bilateral humanitarian assistance to a number,UNGD
RUS,2004,of African countries.,UNGD
RUS,2004,Among the challenges and threats is that of,UNGD
RUS,2004,finding ways to bridge the gap between poor and rich,UNGD
RUS,2004,States. Russia has been making its contribution there;,UNGD
RUS,2004,between 1998 and 2002 it wrote off the debt of African,UNGD
RUS,2004,countries equivalent to $11.2 billion.,UNGD
RUS,2004,Another challenge is ensuring environmental,UNGD
RUS,2004,security. Here I would like to confirm that in,UNGD
RUS,2004,accordance with the decision of President Vladimir V.,UNGD
RUS,2004,Putin we are now engaged in serious consideration of,UNGD
RUS,2004,ratification of the Kyoto Protocol.,UNGD
RUS,2004,The challenges also include preventing the,UNGD
RUS,2004,transformation of outer space into a theatre of armed,UNGD
RUS,2004,"confrontation. Together with China, we are calling for the",UNGD
RUS,2004,conclusion of a comprehensive agreement to that end. We,UNGD
RUS,2004,call upon all countries with space capability to join in that,UNGD
RUS,2004,initiative. There is also a growing need to elaborate a,UNGD
RUS,2004,United Nations convention on outer space law.,UNGD
RUS,2004,A further challenge is the fight against gross,UNGD
RUS,2004,"violations of human rights, with a view to ensuring the",UNGD
RUS,2004,security and dignity of the individual. The United,UNGD
RUS,2004,"Nations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation",UNGD
RUS,2004,"in Europe, the Council of Europe and other",UNGD
RUS,2004,organizations should not remain passive spectators,UNGD
RUS,2004,"when, in some countries, a considerable part of the",UNGD
RUS,2004,population is deprived of citizenship and consequently,UNGD
RUS,2004,"of basic political, social and economic rights.",UNGD
RUS,2004,"On Russiaís initiative, the General Assembly, at",UNGD
RUS,2004,"its fifty-seventh and fifty-eighth sessions, adopted",UNGD
RUS,2004,"resolutions 57/145 and 58/16 respectively, on",UNGD
RUS,2004,"establishing, under the aegis of the United Nations, a",UNGD
RUS,2004,comprehensive approach to countering new threats and,UNGD
RUS,2004,challenges. The resolutions contain specific guidelines,UNGD
RUS,2004,for bringing the international community closer to a,UNGD
RUS,2004,new security model that would meet the global,UNGD
RUS,2004,challenges of the twenty-first century.,UNGD
RUS,2004,Those are the lines along which the High-level,UNGD
RUS,2004,"Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change, established",UNGD
RUS,2004,"by the Secretary-General, is organizing its work. We",UNGD
RUS,2004,hope that its recommendations will pave the way for a,UNGD
RUS,2004,genuine enhancement of the effectiveness of the United,UNGD
RUS,2004,"Nations. At the same time, reform of the Organization,",UNGD
RUS,2004,"and particularly of the Security Council, should be",UNGD
RUS,2004,based on the broadest possible agreement and should,UNGD
RUS,2004,not provoke the alienation of States.,UNGD
RUS,2004,The international community is undergoing a,UNGD
RUS,2004,complex period in its establishment of a new system of,UNGD
RUS,2004,international relations. It is already clear that this will,UNGD
RUS,2004,be a long-term process with an uncertain future and,UNGD
RUS,2004,"one that, so far, is difficult to predict. At the same time,",UNGD
RUS,2004,there is an enormous increase in the number of new,UNGD
RUS,2004,unresolved problems and new dangerous challenges to,UNGD
RUS,2004,security and the development of mankind. We still lack,UNGD
RUS,2004,a collective strategy and universally applicable,UNGD
RUS,2004,"mechanisms for responding to those challenges. In fact,",UNGD
RUS,2004,33,UNGD
RUS,2004,,UNGD
RUS,2004,we have to constantly improvise and use makeshift,UNGD
RUS,2004,means to ensure world stability.,UNGD
RUS,2004,A question arises as to whether we could soon,UNGD
RUS,2004,find ourselves in a situation in which events start to go,UNGD
RUS,2004,out of control. Is it not time for the international,UNGD
RUS,2004,community to assume an active role in impacting upon,UNGD
RUS,2004,global processes and taking targeted actions to,UNGD
RUS,2004,establish a more secure and just world order? Russia is,UNGD
RUS,2004,"fully determined, together with other countries, to",UNGD
RUS,2004,build such a world order and take its proper place,UNGD
RUS,2004,therein as a free and democratic State.,UNGD
RUS,2004,"More than half a century ago, the civilized world",UNGD
RUS,2004,put aside all its disputes and differences and mobilized,UNGD
RUS,2004,its efforts to counter the deadly threat of Nazi,UNGD
RUS,2004,enslavement. The enemy that opposes us today is no,UNGD
RUS,2004,less dangerous and no less merciless. Russia sincerely,UNGD
RUS,2004,hopes that the forthcoming sixtieth anniversary of the,UNGD
RUS,2004,end of World War II and the establishment of the,UNGD
RUS,2004,United Nations will become a historic milestone on the,UNGD
RUS,2004,path to a world order in which the twenty-first century,UNGD
RUS,2004,"sees the noble principles of peace, stability and",UNGD
RUS,2004,development enshrined in the United Nations Charter,UNGD
RUS,2004,hold sway.,UNGD
RUS,2005,In no way can today’s discussion be called,UNGD
RUS,2005,routine. We are faced with summing up the preliminary,UNGD
RUS,2005,results of the large-scale United Nations reforms that,UNGD
RUS,2005,have been launched and designating the main thrust for,UNGD
RUS,2005,the work of the entire system of United Nations,UNGD
RUS,2005,institutions in implementing the outcome document of,UNGD
RUS,2005,the 2005 world summit. We propose to structure the,UNGD
RUS,2005,work of the sixtieth session of the General Assembly in,UNGD
RUS,2005,such a manner as to facilitate the broadest possible,UNGD
RUS,2005,agreement on a number of conceptual issues related to,UNGD
RUS,2005,"strengthening the United Nations that will, to a large",UNGD
RUS,2005,"degree, determine our ability to enhance the",UNGD
RUS,2005,manageability of international trends in an era of,UNGD
RUS,2005,"globalization, and better respond to its new",UNGD
RUS,2005,accompanying threats and challenges.,UNGD
RUS,2005,An analysis of the experience of the United,UNGD
RUS,2005,"Nations over the sixty years of its existence, with all",UNGD
RUS,2005,"the vagaries of the post-war, cold war and post-cold",UNGD
RUS,2005,"war world order, gives us much food for thought and",UNGD
RUS,2005,many conclusions. I would like to share some of that,UNGD
RUS,2005,with you from the viewpoint of the Russian Federation.,UNGD
RUS,2005,As the most representative international,UNGD
RUS,2005,"institution with a universal mandate, the United",UNGD
RUS,2005,Nations has been and remains a major integration,UNGD
RUS,2005,factor in global politics. The success of the United,UNGD
RUS,2005,Nations is our success and its failures are our failures.,UNGD
RUS,2005,"But ultimately the balance of its work is, we believe,",UNGD
RUS,2005,definitely positive. It is primarily due to this,UNGD
RUS,2005,Organization that we have managed to avoid a new,UNGD
RUS,2005,threat of  world war and a nuclear disaster and have,UNGD
RUS,2005,been able to prevent and settle dozens of military,UNGD
RUS,2005,"conflicts. At present, the United Nations mechanisms",UNGD
RUS,2005,continue to be a means of constructive cooperation,UNGD
RUS,2005,touching upon all spheres of human activity.,UNGD
RUS,2005,The greater interdependence of the modern world,UNGD
RUS,2005,has not made it more secure. The standoff between,UNGD
RUS,2005,East and West has been replaced by numerous crises,UNGD
RUS,2005,"and conflicts that until recently had remained latent,",UNGD
RUS,2005,left on the periphery of the interests of the two super-,UNGD
RUS,2005,Powers. Some of those conflicts are becoming real or,UNGD
RUS,2005,"potential sources of international terrorism, feeding",UNGD
RUS,2005,"transborder crime and drug trafficking, which are",UNGD
RUS,2005,closely related to it. Humanity faces the threat of the,UNGD
RUS,2005,uncontrolled spread of weapons of mass destruction,UNGD
RUS,2005,and the possibility of their falling into the hands of,UNGD
RUS,2005,terrorists. Again the world is witnessing genocide and,UNGD
RUS,2005,humanitarian disasters. All of this presents immediate,UNGD
RUS,2005,danger to each and every one of us.,UNGD
RUS,2005,11,UNGD
RUS,2005,,UNGD
RUS,2005,"In that context, the enormous potential of the",UNGD
RUS,2005,"United Nations is in greater demand, primarily in",UNGD
RUS,2005,"ensuring peace and security on a collective and, more",UNGD
RUS,2005,"importantly, on a legitimate legal basis. The",UNGD
RUS,2005,Organization has at its disposal an entire arsenal of,UNGD
RUS,2005,resources enabling it to coordinate the actions of the,UNGD
RUS,2005,"international community, to combine political efforts",UNGD
RUS,2005,"with those in the social, economic and humanitarian",UNGD
RUS,2005,"areas, as well as in the field of protection of human",UNGD
RUS,2005,rights and the environment and other spheres. We,UNGD
RUS,2005,should develop these assets through the concerted,UNGD
RUS,2005,efforts of all States. Russia considers this task to be a,UNGD
RUS,2005,strategic core element of its foreign policy.,UNGD
RUS,2005,The events of the first years of the new,UNGD
RUS,2005,millennium reaffirm the validity of the conclusions,UNGD
RUS,2005,"drawn by the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges",UNGD
RUS,2005,"and Change and the Secretary-General, that is, that a",UNGD
RUS,2005,stronger United Nations and a better use of its,UNGD
RUS,2005,multilateral advantages are an essential instrument to,UNGD
RUS,2005,"build a balanced, safe international system, based on",UNGD
RUS,2005,"respect for the unique features of every country, their",UNGD
RUS,2005,sovereign equality and collective responsibility. There,UNGD
RUS,2005,is no reasonable alternative to this.,UNGD
RUS,2005,Multilateral mechanisms should also play a key,UNGD
RUS,2005,role in resolving the issues of disarmament and the,UNGD
RUS,2005,"non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,",UNGD
RUS,2005,based on strict compliance with the relevant,UNGD
RUS,2005,international agreements. United Nations achievements,UNGD
RUS,2005,"include Security Council resolution 1540 (2004),",UNGD
RUS,2005,"initiated by Russia, and the International Convention",UNGD
RUS,2005,"for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism,",UNGD
RUS,2005,which establishes the legal basis for preventing,UNGD
RUS,2005,weapons of mass destruction from falling into the,UNGD
RUS,2005,hands of terrorists.,UNGD
RUS,2005,It is now crucial to prevent an arms race in outer,UNGD
RUS,2005,space. I remind the Assembly that Russia has assumed,UNGD
RUS,2005,the obligation not to be the first to launch any type of,UNGD
RUS,2005,new weapon into space and has called upon other,UNGD
RUS,2005,countries possessing space capabilities to join in this,UNGD
RUS,2005,measure to keep outer space peaceful. It is time to take,UNGD
RUS,2005,steps to enhance transparency and build confidence in,UNGD
RUS,2005,this area.,UNGD
RUS,2005,"The legal basis for countering new threats,",UNGD
RUS,2005,"primarily terrorism, is being reinforced. The adoption",UNGD
RUS,2005,at the recent Security Council summit of resolution,UNGD
RUS,2005,"1624 (2005), initiated by the United Kingdom, is a",UNGD
RUS,2005,"new, important step forward. It places outside the law",UNGD
RUS,2005,"not only the terrorists, their accomplices and those who",UNGD
RUS,2005,"finance them, but also the individuals inciting terrorist",UNGD
RUS,2005,acts. This Security Council decision should put an end,UNGD
RUS,2005,to attempts to engage the mass media to propagandize,UNGD
RUS,2005,and justify terrorism.,UNGD
RUS,2005,We anticipate that the General Assembly will also,UNGD
RUS,2005,contribute to the fight against terrorism and will,UNGD
RUS,2005,promote completion of the negotiations on a,UNGD
RUS,2005,comprehensive convention on international terrorism,UNGD
RUS,2005,as soon as possible. The fight against terrorism must be,UNGD
RUS,2005,continued most decisively. Each of us should critically,UNGD
RUS,2005,assess his or her efforts in this area.,UNGD
RUS,2005,The realities are that while the sanctions against,UNGD
RUS,2005,"the Taliban, Al-Qaida and associated individuals and",UNGD
RUS,2005,"entities are still in force, the supplying of arms and",UNGD
RUS,2005,material and other kinds of assistance to the fighters,UNGD
RUS,2005,continues. The geographical scope of their activities is,UNGD
RUS,2005,"expanding. For many countries, including Russia, this",UNGD
RUS,2005,is tangible on their own soil. Extremists who are not,UNGD
RUS,2005,directly linked to Al-Qaida  are also stepping up their,UNGD
RUS,2005,activities in various parts of the world. This requires,UNGD
RUS,2005,strengthening of cooperation between States and the,UNGD
RUS,2005,"1267 sanctions Committee, the 1540 Committee and,",UNGD
RUS,2005,"of course, the Security Council’s Counter-Terrorism",UNGD
RUS,2005,"Committee. Furthermore, we believe that the",UNGD
RUS,2005,compilation of a consolidated list of all terrorists and,UNGD
RUS,2005,"terrorist organizations, whether they are associated in",UNGD
RUS,2005,"any way with Al-Qaida or not, cannot be postponed.",UNGD
RUS,2005,The development of criteria for the use of force,UNGD
RUS,2005,in accordance with the United Nations Charter is,UNGD
RUS,2005,"another pressing issue. Such criteria, when agreed",UNGD
RUS,2005,"upon, could be useful if they become a kind of",UNGD
RUS,2005,benchmark for consideration by the Security Council,UNGD
RUS,2005,"of various crisis situations. At the same time, it is clear",UNGD
RUS,2005,that these criteria cannot be applied automatically. The,UNGD
RUS,2005,Security Council would authorize the use of force on a,UNGD
RUS,2005,"case-by-case basis, as called for in the Charter.",UNGD
RUS,2005,"Another equally important topic is that of States,",UNGD
RUS,2005,in exercising their Charter right to individual and,UNGD
RUS,2005,"collective self-defense, to include self-defense in case",UNGD
RUS,2005,of an external terrorist attack or the imminent threat of,UNGD
RUS,2005,"such attack. Russia, like other States that have become",UNGD
RUS,2005,targets of terrorist attacks originating beyond their,UNGD
RUS,2005,"borders, has no right to err in the eyes of its citizens,",UNGD
RUS,2005,who have entrusted their security to us. We anticipate,UNGD
RUS,2005,that those critical issues will be given due attention at,UNGD
RUS,2005,this session of the General Assembly.,UNGD
RUS,2005,"Above all, force should not be used to oppose",UNGD
RUS,2005,law. It can be an effective tool to ensure the rule of law,UNGD
RUS,2005,12,UNGD
RUS,2005,,UNGD
RUS,2005,in crisis situations. It is a tool to be used in,UNGD
RUS,2005,"extraordinary cases in which vital, legally protected",UNGD
RUS,2005,values and interests of the entire international,UNGD
RUS,2005,"community, or certain of its members, are in jeopardy.",UNGD
RUS,2005,"Unfortunately, in the preparations for the 2005",UNGD
RUS,2005,"world summit, insufficient attention was given to",UNGD
RUS,2005,seeking solutions to those and other important issues,UNGD
RUS,2005,"and to finding a way to common understanding. Thus,",UNGD
RUS,2005,that task must remain a top priority of our agenda.,UNGD
RUS,2005,Much remains to be done in terms of,UNGD
RUS,2005,"development and the eradication of poverty, epidemics,",UNGD
RUS,2005,famine and illiteracy. Such action would be the,UNGD
RUS,2005,strongest way to ensure global stability and eliminate,UNGD
RUS,2005,the breeding grounds of extremism of all kinds. Russia,UNGD
RUS,2005,endorses all initiatives aimed at attaining the,UNGD
RUS,2005,Millennium Goals and will enhance its contribution to,UNGD
RUS,2005,resolving those urgent issues. The success of our,UNGD
RUS,2005,concerted efforts to support development greatly,UNGD
RUS,2005,depends on the efficacy of the Peacebuilding,UNGD
RUS,2005,Commission to be established. The Commission will,UNGD
RUS,2005,achieve the required results if it is more than just,UNGD
RUS,2005,another debating society and if it can be a mechanism,UNGD
RUS,2005,facilitating the greater coordination of the programmes,UNGD
RUS,2005,and the projects of all the participants in development,UNGD
RUS,2005,"assistance, including the World Bank Group, the",UNGD
RUS,2005,"International Monetary Fund, regional development",UNGD
RUS,2005,"banks, other multilateral and bilateral donors and, of",UNGD
RUS,2005,"course, recipient countries.",UNGD
RUS,2005,The dramatic events of the last six months have,UNGD
RUS,2005,revealed the sensitivity of the issue of Security Council,UNGD
RUS,2005,reform for the majority of Member States. Guided,UNGD
RUS,2005,above all by its interest in ensuring the Security,UNGD
RUS,2005,"Council’s effectiveness, Russia continues to support",UNGD
RUS,2005,possible modifications of that key organ on the basis of,UNGD
RUS,2005,well-conceived and mutually acceptable decisions.,UNGD
RUS,2005,United Nations Members have made the wise decision,UNGD
RUS,2005,"to continue negotiations, rather than pushing for a vote",UNGD
RUS,2005,that might split the Organization.,UNGD
RUS,2005,I recall the striking words: the United Nations,UNGD
RUS,2005,was created not to make heaven on Earth but to save,UNGD
RUS,2005,"the Earth from hell. Indeed, the United Nations is not",UNGD
RUS,2005,"an ideal body, but the best that humanity was able to",UNGD
RUS,2005,create on the ashes of two world wars. With the help of,UNGD
RUS,2005,"the United Nations, we are able to effectively counter",UNGD
RUS,2005,threats to peace and security in the context of evolving,UNGD
RUS,2005,geopolitical realities.,UNGD
RUS,2005,"Today, mankind is facing the challenges of",UNGD
RUS,2005,globalization. It is not a question of whether we should,UNGD
RUS,2005,"accept those challenges or not, but of how we should",UNGD
RUS,2005,"respond to them, and on the basis of what principles.",UNGD
RUS,2005,The 2005 world summit decisions outline the general,UNGD
RUS,2005,direction for our efforts. As a permanent member of the,UNGD
RUS,2005,Security Council and the next President of the Group,UNGD
RUS,2005,"of Eight, Russia, together with other States, will",UNGD
RUS,2005,continue to strive to strengthen the collective,UNGD
RUS,2005,underpinnings of global politics and to enhance,UNGD
RUS,2005,mechanisms for multilateral cooperation.,UNGD
RUS,2006,"Traditionally, the General Assembly session ",UNGD
RUS,2006,provides an opportunity to conduct a review of the ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"current situation in the world, identify major ",UNGD
RUS,2006,international issues and determine the role that the ,UNGD
RUS,2006,United Nations could play in resolving them.  ,UNGD
RUS,2006, I believe that we have every reason to conclude ,UNGD
RUS,2006,that there is a prevailing trend of growing awareness of ,UNGD
RUS,2006,the need to strengthen the collective foundations of ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"international politics, as well as of the fact that there is ",UNGD
RUS,2006,no alternative to tackling problems through multilateral ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"diplomacy. That trend is based on objective facts, for it ",UNGD
RUS,2006,reflects the realities of an emerging multipolar ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"architecture of international relations. It is logical, ",UNGD
RUS,2006,because answers to global challenges and threats can ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"only be found collectively. Finally, it is a manifestation ",UNGD
RUS,2006,"of historical continuity, because we are revisiting the ",UNGD
RUS,2006,same objective as the founding fathers of the United ,UNGD
RUS,2006,Nations were determined to pursue by enshrining in the ,UNGD
RUS,2006,Charter the principles for a system of collective ,UNGD
RUS,2006,security.  ,UNGD
RUS,2006," It is precisely such an approach, firmly grounded ",UNGD
RUS,2006,"in international law, that can ensure the world’s ",UNGD
RUS,2006,sustainable development in this era of globalization. ,UNGD
RUS,2006,That requires a strengthened central role for the ,UNGD
RUS,2006,universal Organization in every area of international ,UNGD
RUS,2006,life. ,UNGD
RUS,2006, We must of course continue to adapt the ,UNGD
RUS,2006,mechanisms and methods of the United Nations to the ,UNGD
RUS,2006,new environment. Much has been done as follow-up to ,UNGD
RUS,2006,the decisions of the 2005 World Summit: The ,UNGD
RUS,2006,Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"Council have been established, and the reform process ",UNGD
RUS,2006,has been extended to management.  ,UNGD
RUS,2006, It is important that all our further work be based ,UNGD
RUS,2006,upon the fundamental principle of the universality of ,UNGD
RUS,2006,the United Nations. Patterns contrary to the Charter of ,UNGD
RUS,2006,the United Nations that exclude individual States or ,UNGD
RUS,2006,groups of States from participating meaningfully in the ,UNGD
RUS,2006,activities of the Organization or that introduce a single ,UNGD
RUS,2006,system of values into the work of the Secretariat are ,UNGD
RUS,2006,unsustainable. Let us not forget that the United Nations ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"belongs to us all. Moreover, administrative reform ",UNGD
RUS,2006,should not lead to the bureaucracy taking over the ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"management of the Organization, thereby jeopardizing ",UNGD
RUS,2006,the intergovernmental nature of the United Nations. ,UNGD
RUS,2006, A trend towards collective action has also spread ,UNGD
RUS,2006,beyond the structures of the United Nations. During ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"Russia’s presidency of the Group of Eight (G-8), there ",UNGD
RUS,2006,was greater interaction between the G-8 and other ,UNGD
RUS,2006,leading countries and international organizations. Over ,UNGD
RUS,2006,  ,UNGD
RUS,2006, ,UNGD
RUS,2006,06-53005 28 ,UNGD
RUS,2006, ,UNGD
RUS,2006,the past 12 months our dialogue partners have actively ,UNGD
RUS,2006,contributed to Saint Petersburg summit documents on ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"every main agenda item, including global energy ",UNGD
RUS,2006,"security, education and controlling infectious diseases.  ",UNGD
RUS,2006, A new and genuinely collaborative type of ,UNGD
RUS,2006,interaction between the G-8 and Africa is now ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"emerging in this era of globalization, as the needs of ",UNGD
RUS,2006,the continent are reflected in the mainstream of world ,UNGD
RUS,2006,development rather than being viewed as issues ,UNGD
RUS,2006,divorced from overall trends.  ,UNGD
RUS,2006, The G-8 does not have a monopoly over the ,UNGD
RUS,2006,decisions taken at Saint Petersburg. All States are ,UNGD
RUS,2006,invited to participate in their implementation. ,UNGD
RUS,2006, Regional organizations and cooperation and ,UNGD
RUS,2006,coordination between those organizations and the ,UNGD
RUS,2006,United Nations have also strengthened in maintaining ,UNGD
RUS,2006,international peace and security. Issues pertaining to ,UNGD
RUS,2006,that were discussed yesterday at the special ministerial ,UNGD
RUS,2006,meeting of the Security Council (see S/PV.5529). Once ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"again, we are dealing here with an important dimension ",UNGD
RUS,2006,of collective action by the international community. ,UNGD
RUS,2006, The Commonwealth of Independent States has ,UNGD
RUS,2006,made a significant contribution to such interaction. To ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"address common problems, specific actions have been ",UNGD
RUS,2006,"taken within the Commonwealth area, primarily within ",UNGD
RUS,2006,the Eurasian Economic Community and the Collective ,UNGD
RUS,2006,Security Treaty Organization. Further substantive and ,UNGD
RUS,2006,resolute efforts are being made in the context of the ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"Shanghai Cooperation Organization, which developed ",UNGD
RUS,2006,and launched and initiative to establish a partnership ,UNGD
RUS,2006,network for multilateral organizations in the Asia-,UNGD
RUS,2006,Pacific region. Development patterns in that region ,UNGD
RUS,2006,will largely determine the future contours of our planet.  ,UNGD
RUS,2006, Multilateral institutions in Latin America have ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"also become stronger, and the development of the ",UNGD
RUS,2006,African Union is gaining momentum. ,UNGD
RUS,2006," At their recent Summit in Havana, heads of State ",UNGD
RUS,2006,of the countries of the Non-Aligned Movement ,UNGD
RUS,2006,expressed their support for a collective search — ,UNGD
RUS,2006,within the context of the central role of the United ,UNGD
RUS,2006,Nations — for agreed solutions to problems ,UNGD
RUS,2006,confronting the world community. ,UNGD
RUS,2006," Europe, of course, is not outside the common ",UNGD
RUS,2006,trend towards collective examination and resolution of ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"common problems. In that connection, we also see ",UNGD
RUS,2006,growing awareness of the fact that security and ,UNGD
RUS,2006,prosperity are indivisible. We expect NATO to ,UNGD
RUS,2006,transform itself from a defence alliance into something ,UNGD
RUS,2006,more contemporary that would be in line with ,UNGD
RUS,2006,principles of transparency and collective response and ,UNGD
RUS,2006,based upon a universal legal foundation.  ,UNGD
RUS,2006, We have been watching with keen interest the ,UNGD
RUS,2006,emerging foreign policy and security mechanisms of ,UNGD
RUS,2006,the European Union. Russia is prepared to cooperate ,UNGD
RUS,2006,with multilateral structures in the Euro-Atlantic space ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"and other regions of the world. In fact, we already have ",UNGD
RUS,2006,effective common mechanisms with many of them. ,UNGD
RUS,2006, Collective efforts are also needed to further ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"develop international law, primarily within the context ",UNGD
RUS,2006,of countering new threats. The United Nations Global ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"Counter-terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288), which ",UNGD
RUS,2006,"was recently adopted by consensus, is an important ",UNGD
RUS,2006,contribution in terms of strengthening the legal basis ,UNGD
RUS,2006,for the anti-terrorist coalition and ensuring a ,UNGD
RUS,2006,comprehensive approach to counter-terrorism. It is not ,UNGD
RUS,2006,only about countering all terrorist manifestations and ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"ideologies, it is also about eliminating the problems ",UNGD
RUS,2006,that give rise to terrorism. The next step will be to ,UNGD
RUS,2006,agree upon a comprehensive anti-terrorism convention. ,UNGD
RUS,2006, It is necessary to secure the achievements that ,UNGD
RUS,2006,have been made by taking practical steps. In the course ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"of Russia’s presidency of the G-8, the Second ",UNGD
RUS,2006,Ministerial Conference on Drug Trafficking Routes ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"From Afghanistan was held, where additional measures ",UNGD
RUS,2006,were approved aimed at mobilizing the international ,UNGD
RUS,2006,community to counter the terrorism-related drug threat ,UNGD
RUS,2006,originating from Afghanistan. Another international ,UNGD
RUS,2006,meeting will be held in Moscow next November to ,UNGD
RUS,2006,focus on developing modalities for government-,UNGD
RUS,2006,business partnerships in countering terrorism. ,UNGD
RUS,2006, What is needed today are more proactive ,UNGD
RUS,2006,measures to prevent lethal weapons from falling into ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"the hands of non-State actors, as well as the consistent ",UNGD
RUS,2006,implementation of Security Council resolution 1540 ,UNGD
RUS,2006,(2004) and other counter-terrorism resolutions of the ,UNGD
RUS,2006,Council. The Russia-United States global initiative to ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"combat nuclear terrorism, which was launched at Saint ",UNGD
RUS,2006,Petersburg by Presidents Vladimir V. Putin and George ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"W. Bush last July, should be an important tool in ",UNGD
RUS,2006,preventing a linkage between weapons of mass ,UNGD
RUS,2006,destruction and terrorism. That initiative invites ,UNGD
RUS,2006,interested States to act collectively. ,UNGD
RUS,2006, The ever-growing demand for the unique ,UNGD
RUS,2006,peacekeeping capabilities of the United Nations also ,UNGD
RUS,2006,calls for a collective effort. Not all of those capabilities ,UNGD
RUS,2006, ,UNGD
RUS,2006, ,UNGD
RUS,2006,29 06-53005 ,UNGD
RUS,2006, ,UNGD
RUS,2006,have been utilized to the fullest. Utilizing the ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"capabilities of the Military Staff Committee, as well as ",UNGD
RUS,2006,"those of regional organizations, on the basis of the ",UNGD
RUS,2006,relevant provisions of the United Nations Charter ,UNGD
RUS,2006,would be helpful. ,UNGD
RUS,2006, It is encouraging to see a more active role being ,UNGD
RUS,2006,played by Africans themselves in peacemaking ,UNGD
RUS,2006,operations in Africa — an undertaking spearheaded by ,UNGD
RUS,2006,the African Union and supported by the United ,UNGD
RUS,2006,Nations.  ,UNGD
RUS,2006, In a number of crisis situations conditions are ,UNGD
RUS,2006,gradually emerging for a transition to post-conflict ,UNGD
RUS,2006,reconstruction. It is our hope that the Declaration on ,UNGD
RUS,2006,Cooperation and Future Action in Stabilization and ,UNGD
RUS,2006,Reconstruction adopted at the Saint Petersburg G-8 ,UNGD
RUS,2006,Summit will help us complement the efforts of the ,UNGD
RUS,2006,United Nations and regional organizations at this ,UNGD
RUS,2006,critically important period of transition to ,UNGD
RUS,2006,peacebuilding. ,UNGD
RUS,2006, A comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeli ,UNGD
RUS,2006,conflict remains a central task for the world ,UNGD
RUS,2006,community. Many of today’s threats have come ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"together in that region, and the key to resolving them is ",UNGD
RUS,2006,"most often to be found there. In that connection, I ",UNGD
RUS,2006,should first like to mention the truly global challenge ,UNGD
RUS,2006,posed by the need to prevent a schism between ,UNGD
RUS,2006,civilizations.  ,UNGD
RUS,2006, We welcome the emerging prospects for a ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"national agreement in the Palestinian territories, as ",UNGD
RUS,2006,well as for the resumption of the Palestinian-Israeli ,UNGD
RUS,2006,talks. It is important to continue to encourage the ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"parties to meet their respective obligations, with the ",UNGD
RUS,2006,clear understanding that any progress towards the ,UNGD
RUS,2006,objectives set out by the international community will ,UNGD
RUS,2006,inevitably be gradual and that any attempt to act in an ,UNGD
RUS,2006,all-or-nothing spirit will be counterproductive and ,UNGD
RUS,2006,could once again plunge the region into confrontation. ,UNGD
RUS,2006, The recent war in Lebanon demonstrated the ,UNGD
RUS,2006,great fragility of the situation in the Middle East and ,UNGD
RUS,2006,the acute need for a comprehensive approach along all ,UNGD
RUS,2006,tracks. That presupposes the involvement of all ,UNGD
RUS,2006,countries and parties. Without their participation it will ,UNGD
RUS,2006,be impossible to reach any viable negotiated solution. ,UNGD
RUS,2006,It is also clear that the road to comprehensive peace ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"will not be an easy one, but now is the time. The ",UNGD
RUS,2006,initiative of the League of Arab States to convene an ,UNGD
RUS,2006,international conference should contribute to finding ,UNGD
RUS,2006,the proper framework for that undertaking. The Quartet ,UNGD
RUS,2006,of international mediators should also make a key ,UNGD
RUS,2006,contribution to the process. ,UNGD
RUS,2006, A breakthrough on a Middle East settlement ,UNGD
RUS,2006,could provide the positive momentum so wanting in ,UNGD
RUS,2006,the region. It could also facilitate the solution of other ,UNGD
RUS,2006,burning problems in the region and in neighbouring ,UNGD
RUS,2006,countries. That is particularly true as regards efforts ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"aimed at stabilizing the situation in Iraq, where ",UNGD
RUS,2006,attempts to contain wanton violence and chaos have ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"thus far proved unsuccessful. Dozens of people, mainly ",UNGD
RUS,2006,"civilians, continue to die in Iraq every day. Five ",UNGD
RUS,2006,officials of the Russian embassy in Baghdad have also ,UNGD
RUS,2006,fallen victim to that barbarous massacre. A resolution ,UNGD
RUS,2006,in Iraq will be possible only through concerted efforts. ,UNGD
RUS,2006,That requires the involvement in the political process ,UNGD
RUS,2006,of all major Iraqi interests and the implementation of ,UNGD
RUS,2006,the plans of that country’s Government to reach ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"genuine national accord, with the concerted support of ",UNGD
RUS,2006,"the international community, including all of Iraq’s ",UNGD
RUS,2006,neighbours. ,UNGD
RUS,2006," We are, unfortunately, now witnessing growing ",UNGD
RUS,2006,significance of the use of force in world affairs; that ,UNGD
RUS,2006,undermines non-proliferation regimes. The feeling of a ,UNGD
RUS,2006,lack of predictability and stability in the area of ,UNGD
RUS,2006,security is becoming ever more pronounced. Against ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"that background, the growing interest of many States in ",UNGD
RUS,2006,"nuclear energy may give rise to concerns, given the ",UNGD
RUS,2006,trend towards the global proliferation of sensitive ,UNGD
RUS,2006,technologies.  ,UNGD
RUS,2006, Apart from current resolute steps to find ,UNGD
RUS,2006,negotiated solutions to individual problems — such as ,UNGD
RUS,2006,the Iranian nuclear programme and the problem of the ,UNGD
RUS,2006,Korean peninsula — there is a need for an urgent effort ,UNGD
RUS,2006,by the entire international community to systematically ,UNGD
RUS,2006,strengthen non-proliferation regimes on a generally ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"acceptable basis, while ensuring that the benefits of ",UNGD
RUS,2006,peaceful atomic energy are legitimately accessible to ,UNGD
RUS,2006,all States.  ,UNGD
RUS,2006, President Vladimir V. Putin’s initiative to ,UNGD
RUS,2006,establish multilateral centres for nuclear fuel-cycle ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"services, along with similar ideas proposed by the ",UNGD
RUS,2006,leadership of the International Atomic Energy Agency ,UNGD
RUS,2006,(IAEA) and proposals put forth by United States ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"President George W. Bush, have found support among ",UNGD
RUS,2006,G-8 leaders. We are confident that the development and ,UNGD
RUS,2006,practical implementation of such approaches — in ,UNGD
RUS,2006,cooperation with all countries with an interest in ,UNGD
RUS,2006,modern and safe nuclear energy — will make it ,UNGD
RUS,2006,  ,UNGD
RUS,2006, ,UNGD
RUS,2006,06-53005 30 ,UNGD
RUS,2006, ,UNGD
RUS,2006,possible to resolve non-proliferation issues in a non-,UNGD
RUS,2006,confrontational manner. ,UNGD
RUS,2006," As in other areas, the obsession with sanctions — ",UNGD
RUS,2006,applied without calculating their consequences — ,UNGD
RUS,2006,might produce unpredictable results. It is absolutely ,UNGD
RUS,2006,necessary to eliminate the loopholes in the non-,UNGD
RUS,2006,"proliferation regimes, but that should be done through ",UNGD
RUS,2006,"clear and non-discriminatory approaches, without ",UNGD
RUS,2006,creating grounds for suspicion regarding the existence ,UNGD
RUS,2006,of some hidden agenda. ,UNGD
RUS,2006, Stagnation in the international disarmament ,UNGD
RUS,2006,process does not help to resolve non-proliferation ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"problems. Here again, we need concerted action, for ",UNGD
RUS,2006,this is a matter of collective security. ,UNGD
RUS,2006," In the area of strategic arms, the United States-",UNGD
RUS,2006,Russian agreements play an enormously important role. ,UNGD
RUS,2006,Their significance goes far beyond the framework of ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"bilateral relations, considering that virtually all ",UNGD
RUS,2006,members of the international community benefit from ,UNGD
RUS,2006,strategic stability. We support the consistent ,UNGD
RUS,2006,development of the United States-Russian bilateral ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"disarmament process, as was stated by our Presidents ",UNGD
RUS,2006,in Saint Petersburg in July.  ,UNGD
RUS,2006, Closely related to that are issues related to anti-,UNGD
RUS,2006,"ballistic missiles, in particular within the context of the ",UNGD
RUS,2006,"existing plans of the United States. In that context, ",UNGD
RUS,2006,there is a need for complete transparency and for an ,UNGD
RUS,2006,analysis of the consequences for strategic stability. ,UNGD
RUS,2006, The situation surrounding the Treaty on ,UNGD
RUS,2006,Conventional Armed Forces in Europe continues to ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"cause grave concern. The old Treaty, based on the ",UNGD
RUS,2006,"realities of confrontation between military blocs, has ",UNGD
RUS,2006,"lost its relevance, while NATO is blocking the entry ",UNGD
RUS,2006,into force of the Agreement on its adaptation. ,UNGD
RUS,2006," At the same time, reconfiguration of the military ",UNGD
RUS,2006,architecture on the European continent is under way. At ,UNGD
RUS,2006,its heart is an expanding military alliance. Such virtual ,UNGD
RUS,2006,arms control becomes meaningless as it turns into a ,UNGD
RUS,2006,one-way street.  ,UNGD
RUS,2006, It is also necessary to revitalize multilateral ,UNGD
RUS,2006,disarmament approaches. That agenda should include ,UNGD
RUS,2006,the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-,UNGD
RUS,2006,"Test-Ban Treaty, non-deployment of weapons in outer ",UNGD
RUS,2006,"space, conclusion of a fissile material cut-off treaty and ",UNGD
RUS,2006,ensuring information security. Nuclear-weapon-free ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"zones play an important role, and we welcome the ",UNGD
RUS,2006,creation of such a zone in Central Asia. ,UNGD
RUS,2006, The overall task is to reinvigorate the efforts of ,UNGD
RUS,2006,the international community in the area of disarmament ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"and arms control, within the framework of the ",UNGD
RUS,2006,Conference on Disarmament and other relevant United ,UNGD
RUS,2006,Nations bodies.  ,UNGD
RUS,2006, The 2005 World Summit unanimously reaffirmed ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"that peace, security and development are inseparable. ",UNGD
RUS,2006,"With that in mind, we are prepared to engage in ",UNGD
RUS,2006,collective discussions and support further joint ,UNGD
RUS,2006,pragmatic steps with a view to improving the ,UNGD
RUS,2006,efficiency of the social and economic activities of the ,UNGD
RUS,2006,entire United Nations system. ,UNGD
RUS,2006, The Russian Federation realizes its responsibility ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"as one of the fastest growing economies of the world, ",UNGD
RUS,2006,and is devoting increasing attention to development ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"assistance. Thus far, Russia has written off or has ",UNGD
RUS,2006,undertaken to write off $11.3 billion of the debt of ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"African countries, including more than $2.2 billion ",UNGD
RUS,2006,within the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt ,UNGD
RUS,2006,Initiative. New steps are planned in that area. Russia ,UNGD
RUS,2006,now ranks third in absolute figures of debt relief and ,UNGD
RUS,2006,first in terms of the ratio of debt relief to gross ,UNGD
RUS,2006,domestic product. We have also increased our ,UNGD
RUS,2006,contributions to other international development ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"assistance mechanisms, including through United ",UNGD
RUS,2006,Nations institutions and funds and the Bretton Woods ,UNGD
RUS,2006,institutions. ,UNGD
RUS,2006," Today, I cannot fail to express my sincere ",UNGD
RUS,2006,appreciation and praise to the Secretary-General Kofi ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"Annan. For many years, during the most difficult times ",UNGD
RUS,2006,"for world politics, he has carried out his duties with ",UNGD
RUS,2006,dignity. Thanks largely to the efforts of Kofi Annan ,UNGD
RUS,2006,and to his ability to take the lead while remaining a ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"realist in the face of severe challenges, we have ",UNGD
RUS,2006,managed to make progress in strengthening the United ,UNGD
RUS,2006,Nations. ,UNGD
RUS,2006, Today the United Nations is relevant as never ,UNGD
RUS,2006,before. We do not have to create it anew. In the course ,UNGD
RUS,2006,of reforming the United Nations in accordance with the ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"dictates of the time, it is incumbent upon us all to ",UNGD
RUS,2006,reaffirm by action our commitment to the world ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"Organization, which draws its strength from our trust ",UNGD
RUS,2006,in it and in its unique legitimacy. Without the United ,UNGD
RUS,2006,"Nations and its Charter to rely upon, it would prove ",UNGD
RUS,2006,impossible to ensure a more reliable and democratic ,UNGD
RUS,2006,system of collective security that would respond to the ,UNGD
RUS,2006,dictates of our time. ,UNGD
RUS,2007,"Traditionally, the General Assembly sums up ",UNGD
RUS,2007,the results of the ending political year. This requires ,UNGD
RUS,2007,serious and joint consideration. It is essential to ,UNGD
RUS,2007,identify agreed solutions for today’s global problems ,UNGD
RUS,2007,based on the collective analysis of current international ,UNGD
RUS,2007,affairs. It appears that no one is challenging that ,UNGD
RUS,2007,security and prosperity are inseparable in an ,UNGD
RUS,2007,increasingly globalized world. Our approach should be ,UNGD
RUS,2007,"similarly comprehensive, taking into account the ",UNGD
RUS,2007,inseparable link between the issues of peace and ,UNGD
RUS,2007,"development, which has been amply proven by our ",UNGD
RUS,2007,recent experience.  ,UNGD
RUS,2007, The expanding range of conflicts in international ,UNGD
RUS,2007,"politics through the exacerbation of regional crises, the ",UNGD
RUS,2007,"increasing threat of terrorism, the risk of the spread of ",UNGD
RUS,2007,weapons of mass destruction and stagnation on ,UNGD
RUS,2007,"disarmament jeopardize international stability, divert ",UNGD
RUS,2007,resources from constructive uses and undermines the ,UNGD
RUS,2007,potential for sustainable worldwide economic growth. ,UNGD
RUS,2007,And it is such growth that is our common fundamental ,UNGD
RUS,2007,goal. Poverty and economic backwardness expand the ,UNGD
RUS,2007,breeding ground for extremism.  ,UNGD
RUS,2007," On the other hand, developments over the past ",UNGD
RUS,2007,year provide convincing proof that an essentially new ,UNGD
RUS,2007,"geopolitical situation has been developing in the world, ",UNGD
RUS,2007,one that is defined primarily by emerging multipolarity. ,UNGD
RUS,2007,We need to agree on what inferences we can draw from ,UNGD
RUS,2007,"this. In his Munich speech in February, President ",UNGD
RUS,2007,Vladimir Putin of the Russian Federation called for an ,UNGD
RUS,2007,open and sincere dialogue that would enable us to work ,UNGD
RUS,2007,out a common understanding of the current historical ,UNGD
RUS,2007,epoch and of the modus operandi it obliges our nations ,UNGD
RUS,2007,to adopt.  ,UNGD
RUS,2007," The international landscape is changing, due to ",UNGD
RUS,2007,"newly emerging centres of global growth. Today, ",UNGD
RUS,2007,nobody can cope with global challenges single-,UNGD
RUS,2007,handedly. Neither diktat nor bipolar dominance can ,UNGD
RUS,2007,fulfil the task of world governance. What is needed is ,UNGD
RUS,2007,collective leadership by major States; this should be ,UNGD
RUS,2007,representative both geographically and in terms of ,UNGD
RUS,2007,civilizations. The basis for such an informal ,UNGD
RUS,2007,mechanism can be provided only by the United Nations ,UNGD
RUS,2007,with its unique legitimacy.  ,UNGD
RUS,2007, Multilateral diplomacy based on international law ,UNGD
RUS,2007,"has come to the fore. Like any society of free people, a ",UNGD
RUS,2007,world of free nations needs universal regulatory ,UNGD
RUS,2007,principles to ensure predictability and confidence in ,UNGD
RUS,2007,international affairs. The way to achieve this goal lies ,UNGD
RUS,2007,through strengthening the United Nations system by ,UNGD
RUS,2007,further adapting it to modern global realities. Decisions ,UNGD
RUS,2007,here should be based on the broadest possible ,UNGD
RUS,2007,consensus among Member States and on the universal ,UNGD
RUS,2007,intergovernmental nature of the United Nations. It is ,UNGD
RUS,2007,from that perspective that we view the reform ,UNGD
RUS,2007,initiatives proposed by Secretary-General Ban ,UNGD
RUS,2007,Ki-moon.  ,UNGD
RUS,2007, It will be in our common interest to make more ,UNGD
RUS,2007,active use of United Nations peacekeeping capabilities. ,UNGD
RUS,2007,These could be improved by more effective use of a ,UNGD
RUS,2007,body such as the Military Staff Committee. The ,UNGD
RUS,2007,initiative put forward by the President of Russia in ,UNGD
RUS,2007,2000 to enhance the work of the Military Staff ,UNGD
RUS,2007,"Committee remains relevant. Naturally, a renewed ",UNGD
RUS,2007,Committee should operate with the participation of all ,UNGD
RUS,2007,"members of the Security Council, as provided for in ",UNGD
RUS,2007,the United Nations Charter.  ,UNGD
RUS,2007, Much remains to be done also in improving the ,UNGD
RUS,2007,interaction of the United Nations with regional ,UNGD
RUS,2007,organizations that have proven their ability to ,UNGD
RUS,2007,effectively participate in resolving security and ,UNGD
RUS,2007,development issues. A positive interrelationship ,UNGD
RUS,2007,between the principles of multilateralism and ,UNGD
RUS,2007,"regionalism is obviously very important. At present, ",UNGD
RUS,2007,more than 50 per cent of international trade is carried ,UNGD
RUS,2007,out under regional trade agreements. Global trade ,UNGD
RUS,2007,regulation mechanisms cannot be effective without ,UNGD
RUS,2007,"regional integration, which is key to the economic ",UNGD
RUS,2007,well-being of all the regions of the world.  ,UNGD
RUS,2007, Russia is actively signing and using regional ,UNGD
RUS,2007,trade agreements to achieve mutual liberalization of ,UNGD
RUS,2007,trade. Russia intends to use its current chairmanship of ,UNGD
RUS,2007,the Eurasian Economic Community to give a more ,UNGD
RUS,2007,"practical focus to the organization, which since 2003 ",UNGD
RUS,2007,has had observer status in the General Assembly. ,UNGD
RUS,2007,"Russia, along with other sponsors, will submit to the ",UNGD
RUS,2007,General Assembly a draft resolution on cooperation ,UNGD
RUS,2007,between the United Nations and the Eurasian ,UNGD
RUS,2007,"Economic Community, aimed at providing a more ",UNGD
RUS,2007,systemic basis and facilitating the timely realization of ,UNGD
RUS,2007,the Millennium Development Goals. We also hope that ,UNGD
RUS,2007,United Nations Member States would honour the ,UNGD
RUS,2007,Eurasian Development Bank the status of observer in ,UNGD
RUS,2007,the General Assembly. We shall actively promote the ,UNGD
RUS,2007,"attainment of these objectives, including in the ",UNGD
RUS,2007,framework of the process to reinvigorate the ,UNGD
RUS,2007,Commonwealth of Independent States and build up ,UNGD
RUS,2007,strategic offensive capabilities.  ,UNGD
RUS,2007, The international community’s efforts should ,UNGD
RUS,2007,remain focused on reaching the Millennium ,UNGD
RUS,2007,"Development Goals. We are concerned that today, ",UNGD
RUS,2007,"seven years since the Millennium Summit, many ",UNGD
RUS,2007,"developing countries, especially the least developed ",UNGD
RUS,2007,"countries, are still significantly behind schedule in ",UNGD
RUS,2007,achieving the Millennium Development Goals. ,UNGD
RUS,2007,Particular attention should be paid to the specific needs ,UNGD
RUS,2007,of the African continent.  ,UNGD
RUS,2007, Russia fully shares the principles of global ,UNGD
RUS,2007,"partnership in the interest of development, as approved ",UNGD
RUS,2007,at the Monterrey International Conference on ,UNGD
RUS,2007,Financing for Development and intends to increase its ,UNGD
RUS,2007,input to our common efforts in that area. We shall ,UNGD
RUS,2007,consistently strengthen our position as a donor country ,UNGD
RUS,2007,in accordance with the approach to Russian ,UNGD
RUS,2007,participation in international development assistance ,UNGD
RUS,2007,approved by President Putin in June 2007.  ,UNGD
RUS,2007, We are confident that concrete steps to ensure ,UNGD
RUS,2007,sustainable socio-economic development in all regions ,UNGD
RUS,2007,are a sure remedy against threats to peace and security.  ,UNGD
RUS,2007, There is a pressing need to use any means ,UNGD
RUS,2007,available to strengthen the leading role of the United ,UNGD
RUS,2007,"Nations in fighting terrorism. Here, the Organization’s ",UNGD
RUS,2007,activities should be based on a comprehensive ,UNGD
RUS,2007,"framework, including the United Nations Global ",UNGD
RUS,2007,Counter-Terrorism Strategy adopted last year as ,UNGD
RUS,2007,"resolution 60/288, and on a comprehensive convention ",UNGD
RUS,2007,on international terrorism. The Collective Security ,UNGD
RUS,2007,Treaty Organization is contributing to these efforts and ,UNGD
RUS,2007,has established useful interaction with the United ,UNGD
RUS,2007,Nations.  ,UNGD
RUS,2007,Our efforts to resolve regional conflicts and ,UNGD
RUS,2007,urgent social and economic problems should form part ,UNGD
RUS,2007,of our counter-terrorism efforts.  ,UNGD
RUS,2007, Iraq has become a source of destabilization for ,UNGD
RUS,2007,"the whole region. Ensuring security, not to mention ",UNGD
RUS,2007,"economic development, in that country requires a new ",UNGD
RUS,2007,strategy focused on reaching genuine national ,UNGD
RUS,2007,reconciliation with the participation of all of Iraq’s ,UNGD
RUS,2007,neighbours and with the support of the international ,UNGD
RUS,2007,community. We call upon the Secretary-General to take ,UNGD
RUS,2007,"an active role in this issue, given the additional power ",UNGD
RUS,2007,the United Nations can wield towards an Iraqi ,UNGD
RUS,2007,settlement. The participants in recent multilateral ,UNGD
RUS,2007,"meetings on Iraq have upheld that approach, and we ",UNGD
RUS,2007,support the decision endorsed at those meetings.  ,UNGD
RUS,2007, The indivisibility of security is to be seen clearly ,UNGD
RUS,2007,in the Middle East. Early solution of the Palestine ,UNGD
RUS,2007,problem based on the two-State concept and the ,UNGD
RUS,2007,achievement of a comprehensive Middle East ,UNGD
RUS,2007,settlement underpinned by the international legal ,UNGD
RUS,2007,platform developed by the United Nations are next on ,UNGD
RUS,2007,the agenda. We are convinced that this goal could be ,UNGD
RUS,2007,advanced by holding a representative international ,UNGD
RUS,2007,conference preceded by thorough preparation. We ,UNGD
RUS,2007,consider the United States initiative to convene in ,UNGD
RUS,2007,November a multiparty meeting on a Middle East ,UNGD
RUS,2007,settlement as a step in that direction. We appreciate the ,UNGD
RUS,2007,preliminary considerations voiced by the United States ,UNGD
RUS,2007,side regarding the agenda and composition of that ,UNGD
RUS,2007,event. We reaffirm the importance of involving the ,UNGD
RUS,2007,Quartet of international mediators and the Arab League ,UNGD
RUS,2007,in the preparations.  ,UNGD
RUS,2007, Settlement of the Kosovo problem is only ,UNGD
RUS,2007,possible within the framework of international and law ,UNGD
RUS,2007,based on negotiations. Unilateral steps will not lead to ,UNGD
RUS,2007,a lasting peace and will create the risk of ,UNGD
RUS,2007,destabilization in the Balkans and other regions.  ,UNGD
RUS,2007, Complex problems require an integrated ,UNGD
RUS,2007,approach. This is particularly true for the situation ,UNGD
RUS,2007,around Iran. The goal of nuclear non-proliferation is an ,UNGD
RUS,2007,"absolute priority. At the same time, we should not ",UNGD
RUS,2007,ignore the task of engaging Iran in constructive efforts ,UNGD
RUS,2007,to resolve regional and international issues.  ,UNGD
RUS,2007, Urgent steps are needed to strengthen the ,UNGD
RUS,2007,non-proliferation regime while providing all States ,UNGD
RUS,2007,with legitimate access to the benefits of the peaceful ,UNGD
RUS,2007,uses of nuclear energy. The joint initiative of the ,UNGD
RUS,2007,"Presidents of Russia and the United States, put forward ",UNGD
RUS,2007,"at their Kennebunkport meeting, is aimed at starting ",UNGD
RUS,2007,joint practical work in this field.  ,UNGD
RUS,2007, We are confident that today peace should be ,UNGD
RUS,2007,"based on willingness to cooperate, especially on ",UNGD
RUS,2007,matters directly affecting strategic stability. In this ,UNGD
RUS,2007,"context, we cannot neglect the unilateral plans in the ",UNGD
RUS,2007,area of missile defence. President Putin has proposed a ,UNGD
RUS,2007,constructive alternative: collaborative work with the ,UNGD
RUS,2007,"participation of Russia, the United States and Europe, ",UNGD
RUS,2007,and subsequently with that of other countries. Such ,UNGD
RUS,2007,work could lead to a genuinely global strategic alliance ,UNGD
RUS,2007,"encompassing the entire Euro-Atlantic region, which ",UNGD
RUS,2007,would allow us to move forward in establishing an ,UNGD
RUS,2007,open system of collective security. Our proposals are ,UNGD
RUS,2007,"under discussion, and we hope that the collective ",UNGD
RUS,2007,approach will prevail. ,UNGD
RUS,2007, The principle of the indivisibility of security ,UNGD
RUS,2007,should form the basis for resolving the situation around ,UNGD
RUS,2007,the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. ,UNGD
RUS,2007,"Russia stands ready to engage in that process, and ",UNGD
RUS,2007,proposals are well known. We expect that these ,UNGD
RUS,2007,proposals will be seriously discussed during the ,UNGD
RUS,2007,upcoming consultations. ,UNGD
RUS,2007, The possibility of deploying weapons in outer ,UNGD
RUS,2007,space poses a serious threat. The magnitude of that ,UNGD
RUS,2007,threat is determined by the global coverage of the ,UNGD
RUS,2007,"deployment, which can endanger all States without ",UNGD
RUS,2007,exception. We consistently oppose the deployment in ,UNGD
RUS,2007,"space of weapons of any type, and we call upon the ",UNGD
RUS,2007,international community to conclude an agreement to ,UNGD
RUS,2007,that effect. ,UNGD
RUS,2007, Another outstanding global issue is the effective ,UNGD
RUS,2007,"prevention of climate change, which requires agreed ",UNGD
RUS,2007,and scientifically based solutions that are realistic and ,UNGD
RUS,2007,balanced and that do not undercut countries’ right to ,UNGD
RUS,2007,development. Russia has always stood for a ,UNGD
RUS,2007,constructive dialogue with a view to giving a genuinely ,UNGD
RUS,2007,universal character to the international climate ,UNGD
RUS,2007,protection regime. We hope that the important meetings ,UNGD
RUS,2007,that took place this week in New York and Washington ,UNGD
RUS,2007,will facilitate thorough preparations for a successful ,UNGD
RUS,2007,launch in December in Bali of negotiations on joint ,UNGD
RUS,2007,post-2012 efforts. ,UNGD
RUS,2007, The spiritual and moral foundations of human ,UNGD
RUS,2007,solidarity are of increasingly vital importance. The ,UNGD
RUS,2007,spiritual values of all world religions demand that we ,UNGD
RUS,2007,achieve intercivilizational accord and fight ,UNGD
RUS,2007,"manifestations of xenophobia and racism, as well as ",UNGD
RUS,2007,the resurgence of neo-Nazi trends. Those are the tasks ,UNGD
RUS,2007,to be tackled within the framework of the Alliance of ,UNGD
RUS,2007,"Civilizations, which we support.  The World Summit of ",UNGD
RUS,2007,Religious Leaders held in Moscow last year added a ,UNGD
RUS,2007,new dimension to this endeavour. We propose to build ,UNGD
RUS,2007,upon the results of the Summit and to think about ,UNGD
RUS,2007,"establishing, under United Nations auspices, a special ",UNGD
RUS,2007,forum   a kind of consultative council of religions   ,UNGD
RUS,2007,for exchanges of views among representatives of major ,UNGD
RUS,2007,world faiths. ,UNGD
RUS,2007, Russia will spare no effort to strengthen ,UNGD
RUS,2007,multilateral cooperation within the framework of the ,UNGD
RUS,2007,United Nations. I am convinced that with a continued ,UNGD
RUS,2007,commitment to the principles of the United Nations ,UNGD
RUS,2007,"Charter, we can make progress in the creation of an ",UNGD
RUS,2007,"effective system of collective security, as was the will ",UNGD
RUS,2007,of the founding fathers of the world Organization.,UNGD
RUS,2008,"On 11 September 2001, the world changed, ",UNGD
RUS,2008,and it rallied together in the fight against the threat of ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"terror, a threat that was common for all and knew no ",UNGD
RUS,2008,boundaries. I am referring to threat of terrorism. The ,UNGD
RUS,2008,world displayed an unprecedented level of solidarity by ,UNGD
RUS,2008,rejecting old phobias and stereotypes. It seemed that ,UNGD
RUS,2008,the global counter-terrorism coalition became a new ,UNGD
RUS,2008,reality that from then on would define the development ,UNGD
RUS,2008,of a system of international relations free from double ,UNGD
RUS,2008,standards and beneficial to all. ,UNGD
RUS,2008, The cohesion in the face of the deadly threats ,UNGD
RUS,2008,emerging from Al-Qaida and other elements of ,UNGD
RUS,2008,international terrorism made it possible to achieve ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"tangible success during the initial stage. But later, ",UNGD
RUS,2008,problems began to appear. A painful blow to the unity ,UNGD
RUS,2008,of the anti-terrorism coalition was delivered by the war ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"in Iraq, when — as it turned out later, under the false ",UNGD
RUS,2008,pretext of the fight against terror and nuclear arms ,UNGD
RUS,2008,proliferation — international law was violated. The ,UNGD
RUS,2008,deepest crisis was thus created in a completely ,UNGD
RUS,2008,artificial way and even today it is far from being ,UNGD
RUS,2008,resolved. ,UNGD
RUS,2008, Ever more questions are being raised about what ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"is going on in Afghanistan. First and foremost, what is ",UNGD
RUS,2008,the acceptable price to pay in terms of the loss of ,UNGD
RUS,2008,civilians’ lives in the ongoing counter-terrorism ,UNGD
RUS,2008,operation? Who decides on criteria for determining ,UNGD
RUS,2008,proportionality in the use of force? And why are the ,UNGD
RUS,2008,international contingents that are present unwilling to ,UNGD
RUS,2008,engage in the fight against the proliferating drug threat ,UNGD
RUS,2008,that causes increasing suffering in the countries of ,UNGD
RUS,2008,Central Asia and Europe? These and other factors give ,UNGD
RUS,2008,us reason to believe that the counter-terrorism coalition ,UNGD
RUS,2008,is faced with a crisis.  ,UNGD
RUS,2008," Looking at the core of the problem, it seems that ",UNGD
RUS,2008,this coalition lacks the requisite collective ,UNGD
RUS,2008,arrangements: equality among all its members in ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"deciding on strategy and, especially, operational ",UNGD
RUS,2008,tactics. But in order to control the entirely new ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"situation that evolved after 9/11, which required ",UNGD
RUS,2008,"genuine cooperative effort, including joint analysis and ",UNGD
RUS,2008,"coordination of practical steps, mechanisms designed ",UNGD
RUS,2008,for a unipolar world began to be used; decisions were ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"taken in a single centre of power, while the rest merely ",UNGD
RUS,2008,had to follow. ,UNGD
RUS,2008, We ended up with a privatization of the ,UNGD
RUS,2008,international community’s efforts in the fight against ,UNGD
RUS,2008,terrorism. The inertia of the unipolar world also ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"revealed itself in other spheres of international life, ",UNGD
RUS,2008,including unilateral steps taken in anti-missile defence ,UNGD
RUS,2008,and the militarization of outer space as well as in ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"attempts to bypass parity in arms control regimes, ",UNGD
RUS,2008,"expansion of political-military blocs, and politicization ",UNGD
RUS,2008,  ,UNGD
RUS,2008, ,UNGD
RUS,2008,08-53129 2 ,UNGD
RUS,2008, ,UNGD
RUS,2008,of the issues of access to and transport of energy ,UNGD
RUS,2008,resources. ,UNGD
RUS,2008, The illusion of the existence of a unipolar world ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"confused many. For some people, it generated a desire ",UNGD
RUS,2008,to place all of their eggs in one basket. In exchange for ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"absolute loyalty, there was an expectation of carte ",UNGD
RUS,2008,"blanche to resolve all problems, using any means. The ",UNGD
RUS,2008,emerging syndrome of complete permissiveness that ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"developed led to a rampage on the night of 8 August, ",UNGD
RUS,2008,when aggression was unleashed on South Ossetia. The ,UNGD
RUS,2008,bombing of the sleeping city of Tskhinvali and the ,UNGD
RUS,2008,killing of civilians and peacekeepers trampled under ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"foot all existing settlement agreements, thus putting an ",UNGD
RUS,2008,end to the territorial integrity of Georgia. ,UNGD
RUS,2008, Russia helped South Ossetia to repel that ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"aggression, and carried out its duty to protect its ",UNGD
RUS,2008,citizens and fulfil its peacekeeping commitments. ,UNGD
RUS,2008,Russia’s recognition of the independence of South ,UNGD
RUS,2008,Ossetia and Abkhazia was the only possible step to ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"ensure not only their security, but also the very survival ",UNGD
RUS,2008,"of their peoples, considering the previous record of ",UNGD
RUS,2008,chauvinism of the Georgian leaders — starting with the ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"Georgian leader Zviad Gamsakhurdia who, in 1991, ",UNGD
RUS,2008,"under the slogan of “Georgia for Georgians”, ordered ",UNGD
RUS,2008,"the deportation of Ossetians to Russia, abolished the ",UNGD
RUS,2008,autonomous status of South Ossetia and Abkhazia and ,UNGD
RUS,2008,later unleashed a bloody war against them.  ,UNGD
RUS,2008, That war was brought to an end at the cost of ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"innumerable human lives, and peacekeeping and ",UNGD
RUS,2008,negotiation mechanisms were established with the ,UNGD
RUS,2008,approval of the United Nations and the Organization ,UNGD
RUS,2008,for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"However, the current Georgian leadership has pursued ",UNGD
RUS,2008,a persistent policy of undermining those mechanisms ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"through relentless provocation, and finally nullified the ",UNGD
RUS,2008,peace process by launching a new murderous war on ,UNGD
RUS,2008,the night of 8 August. ,UNGD
RUS,2008, This problem is now closed. The future of the ,UNGD
RUS,2008,peoples of Abkhazia and South Ossetia has been ,UNGD
RUS,2008,reliably secured by the treaties between Moscow and ,UNGD
RUS,2008,Tskhinvali and Sukhumi. With the implementation of ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"the Medvedev-Sarkozy plan, to which we are strongly ",UNGD
RUS,2008,"committed, the situation around the two republics will ",UNGD
RUS,2008,finally be stabilized. It is important that this plan ,UNGD
RUS,2008,should be strictly and unswervingly implemented by all ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"parties. We are concerned, however, by the attempts to ",UNGD
RUS,2008,rewrite it after the fact. ,UNGD
RUS,2008, I believe that everyone here has tired of playing ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"the role of extras for the Georgian regime, whose ",UNGD
RUS,2008,words contain not a shred of truth and whose foreign ,UNGD
RUS,2008,policy is aimed exclusively at provoking confrontation ,UNGD
RUS,2008,throughout the world in the pursuit of their own ,UNGD
RUS,2008,objectives which invariably run counter to the ,UNGD
RUS,2008,objectives of the Georgian people and to the goal of ,UNGD
RUS,2008,ensuring security in the Caucasus. ,UNGD
RUS,2008," Today, it is necessary to analyse the crisis in the ",UNGD
RUS,2008,Caucasus from the viewpoint of its impact on the ,UNGD
RUS,2008,region and the international community as a whole. ,UNGD
RUS,2008,The world has changed yet again. It has become ,UNGD
RUS,2008,absolutely clear that the solidarity demonstrated after ,UNGD
RUS,2008,9/11 must be revived through approaches untainted by ,UNGD
RUS,2008,geopolitical expediency and built on the rejection of ,UNGD
RUS,2008,double standards when fighting against any violations ,UNGD
RUS,2008,or breaches of international law — whether on the part ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"of terrorists, political extremists or any others. ",UNGD
RUS,2008, The crisis in the Caucasus has proved again that ,UNGD
RUS,2008,it is impossible to resolve the problems we face when ,UNGD
RUS,2008,blinded by the mirage of a unipolar world. The price ,UNGD
RUS,2008,we will have to pay in terms of human lives and ,UNGD
RUS,2008,destinies is too high. We cannot tolerate any attempts ,UNGD
RUS,2008,to resolve conflict situations by violating international ,UNGD
RUS,2008,agreements or by the unlawful use of force. If we allow ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"that to occur once, then we run the risk of unleashing it ",UNGD
RUS,2008,in the future. ,UNGD
RUS,2008, One cannot invoke the duty to defend in the ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"abstract, and then be outraged when that principle is ",UNGD
RUS,2008,used in practice — and in strict conformity with Article ,UNGD
RUS,2008,51 of the United Nations Charter and other norms of ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"international law. In South Ossetia, Russia defended ",UNGD
RUS,2008,"the highest of our common values, the most essential ",UNGD
RUS,2008,human right: the right to live.  ,UNGD
RUS,2008, The existing security architecture in Europe did ,UNGD
RUS,2008,not pass the test of recent events. Attempts to adjust it ,UNGD
RUS,2008,to the rules of a unipolar world led to a situation where ,UNGD
RUS,2008,that architecture proved incapable of containing an ,UNGD
RUS,2008,aggressor or  preventing the supply of offensive ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"weapons to it, contrary to all existing relevant codes of ",UNGD
RUS,2008,conduct. ,UNGD
RUS,2008, We propose that this issue should be addressed in ,UNGD
RUS,2008,a comprehensive manner. President Dmitry ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"A. Medvedev, of Russia, speaking in Berlin on 5 June, ",UNGD
RUS,2008,proposed an initiative on developing a Euro-Atlantic ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"security treaty, a type of “Helsinki II”. This work could ",UNGD
RUS,2008,have been started at the Pan-European summit with the ,UNGD
RUS,2008, ,UNGD
RUS,2008, ,UNGD
RUS,2008,3 08-53129 ,UNGD
RUS,2008, ,UNGD
RUS,2008,participation of all States as well as all organizations ,UNGD
RUS,2008,working in the region. ,UNGD
RUS,2008, The treaty which we are proposing is meant to ,UNGD
RUS,2008,create a reliable collective security system that would ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"ensure equal security for all States and set out, in ",UNGD
RUS,2008,"legally binding form, the bases of relations among all ",UNGD
RUS,2008,"participants, with a view to strengthening peace, ",UNGD
RUS,2008,ensuring stability and promoting integrated and ,UNGD
RUS,2008,manageable development efforts across the vast Euro-,UNGD
RUS,2008,Atlantic region. This would be a process in which all ,UNGD
RUS,2008,parties would reaffirm their commitment to ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"fundamental principles of international law, such as the ",UNGD
RUS,2008,non-use of force; peaceful settlement of disputes; ,UNGD
RUS,2008,sovereignty; territorial integrity; non-interference in ,UNGD
RUS,2008,internal affairs; and the inadmissibility of ,UNGD
RUS,2008,strengthening one’s own security by infringing upon or ,UNGD
RUS,2008,endangering the security of others. We also need to ,UNGD
RUS,2008,consider together new mechanisms to ensure ,UNGD
RUS,2008,compliance with those fundamental principles. ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"Naturally, such a treaty should organically fit into the ",UNGD
RUS,2008,legal framework of the United Nations Charter and its ,UNGD
RUS,2008,principles of collective security. ,UNGD
RUS,2008, The cold war distorted the nature of international ,UNGD
RUS,2008,relations and turned them into an arena for ideological ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"confrontation. Only now, after the cold war has ended, ",UNGD
RUS,2008,"can the United Nations, created on the basis of a ",UNGD
RUS,2008,"polycentric vision of the world, fully realize its ",UNGD
RUS,2008,"potential. Today as never before, it is important that all ",UNGD
RUS,2008,States reaffirm their commitment to the United Nations ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"as a global forum, to which there is no alternative and ",UNGD
RUS,2008,which possesses a universal mandate and generally ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"recognized legitimacy, and as a centre for open, candid ",UNGD
RUS,2008,and frank debate and coordination of world policies on ,UNGD
RUS,2008,a just and equitable basis free from double standards. ,UNGD
RUS,2008,This is an essential requirement to ensure that the ,UNGD
RUS,2008,world regains its equilibrium. ,UNGD
RUS,2008, The multitude of challenges that humanity is ,UNGD
RUS,2008,facing require comprehensive strengthening of the ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"United Nations. In order to keep up with the times, the ",UNGD
RUS,2008,United Nations requires further rational reform to be ,UNGD
RUS,2008,able to gradually adapt itself to existing political and ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"economic realities. On the whole, we are satisfied by ",UNGD
RUS,2008,"the progress of the reform, including the initial results ",UNGD
RUS,2008,of the activities of the recently established ,UNGD
RUS,2008,Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights ,UNGD
RUS,2008,Council.  ,UNGD
RUS,2008, With regard to expansion of the membership of ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"the Security Council, we will, of course, welcome ",UNGD
RUS,2008,proposals that do not divide United Nations Member ,UNGD
RUS,2008,States but rather facilitate the search for mutually ,UNGD
RUS,2008,acceptable compromises and lead to a broad-based ,UNGD
RUS,2008,agreement. ,UNGD
RUS,2008, Of increasing importance in the reform process is ,UNGD
RUS,2008,the promotion of dialogue and partnership among ,UNGD
RUS,2008,civilizations. Russia supports the Alliance of ,UNGD
RUS,2008,Civilizations and other initiatives in that regard. We ,UNGD
RUS,2008,reiterate our proposal that a consultative council of ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"religions be established under United Nations auspices, ",UNGD
RUS,2008,taking into account the increasing role of the religious ,UNGD
RUS,2008,aspect in international life. That would assist in ,UNGD
RUS,2008,strengthening moral principles and incorporating them ,UNGD
RUS,2008,into international affairs.  ,UNGD
RUS,2008," Among the priorities of United Nations activities, ",UNGD
RUS,2008,a number of urgent issues have recently appeared on ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"the Organization’s agenda, including climate change ",UNGD
RUS,2008,and food and energy security. Those problems are ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"global and interrelated, and they can be addressed and ",UNGD
RUS,2008,resolved only through a global partnership at a ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"qualitatively new level, with active involvement by ",UNGD
RUS,2008,"Governments, the scientific and business communities ",UNGD
RUS,2008,and civil society. ,UNGD
RUS,2008," In particular, the current financial crisis requires ",UNGD
RUS,2008,urgent attention and synergy of efforts. From this ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"rostrum, the President of France has put forward ",UNGD
RUS,2008,important initiatives aimed at a cooperative search for ,UNGD
RUS,2008,ways to revitalize the international financial system ,UNGD
RUS,2008,that involve the world’s leading economies. In that ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"context, we support the further development of ",UNGD
RUS,2008,partnerships between the members of the Group of ,UNGD
RUS,2008,Eight and key States in all developing regions. The ,UNGD
RUS,2008,Economic and Social Council could also play a role ,UNGD
RUS,2008,here. Russia will continue to participate responsibly in ,UNGD
RUS,2008,the work of various bodies of the United Nations ,UNGD
RUS,2008,system and in other contexts to help find an equitable ,UNGD
RUS,2008,solution to all those problems. ,UNGD
RUS,2008, The international development assistance ,UNGD
RUS,2008,mechanisms being established in Russia will help us to ,UNGD
RUS,2008,increase the extent and effectiveness of our ,UNGD
RUS,2008,participation in international efforts to fight hunger and ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"disease, to promote broader access to education and to ",UNGD
RUS,2008,"overcome energy shortages, which will be our ",UNGD
RUS,2008,additional contribution to the achievement of the ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"Millennium Development Goals. It is only natural that, ",UNGD
RUS,2008,"in so doing, we should pay particular attention to ",UNGD
RUS,2008,assisting nearby countries. All countries have partners ,UNGD
RUS,2008,with which they share traditional friendly relations ,UNGD
RUS,2008,  ,UNGD
RUS,2008, ,UNGD
RUS,2008,08-53129 4 ,UNGD
RUS,2008, ,UNGD
RUS,2008,based on a common history and geography. It is wrong ,UNGD
RUS,2008,to artificially undermine such relationships for the ,UNGD
RUS,2008,benefit of geopolitical schemes and against the will of ,UNGD
RUS,2008,the people.  ,UNGD
RUS,2008, We will continue to work together with all our ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"neighbours. First and foremost, along with the other ",UNGD
RUS,2008,"countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States, ",UNGD
RUS,2008,we will continue to develop the integration processes ,UNGD
RUS,2008,within the Collective Security Treaty Organization and ,UNGD
RUS,2008,the Eurasian Economic Community in order to ,UNGD
RUS,2008,preserve and promote our common heritage of culture ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"and civilization, which, in a globalizing world, is a ",UNGD
RUS,2008,major resource of the Commonwealth and of each of its ,UNGD
RUS,2008,member States. That is why we have a particular ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"interest in cooperating with those countries, and it is ",UNGD
RUS,2008,also why they view Russia as an area of special ,UNGD
RUS,2008,interest. We will therefore base our relations on the ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"principles of equality, mutual benefit, respect for and ",UNGD
RUS,2008,consideration of one another’s interests and compliance ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"with existing agreements, in particular those on the ",UNGD
RUS,2008,peaceful settlement of disputes. That is also the way in ,UNGD
RUS,2008,which we intend to develop our relations in other ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"regions of the world: openly, on the basis of ",UNGD
RUS,2008,international law and without any zero-sum games. ,UNGD
RUS,2008,Those principles were set out in the foreign policy ,UNGD
RUS,2008,concept approved by President Medvedev in July this ,UNGD
RUS,2008,year.  ,UNGD
RUS,2008, Russia is consistently implementing its network ,UNGD
RUS,2008,diplomacy and promoting cooperation in various ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"formats: the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the ",UNGD
RUS,2008,"BRIC countries — Brazil, Russia, India and China — ",UNGD
RUS,2008,"partnership mechanisms with the European Union, the ",UNGD
RUS,2008,"Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the ",UNGD
RUS,2008,"Organization of the Islamic Conference, the League of ",UNGD
RUS,2008,Arab States and regional organizations in Latin ,UNGD
RUS,2008,America. ,UNGD
RUS,2008, The developments that occurred in August gave ,UNGD
RUS,2008,us yet another occasion to think about the ,UNGD
RUS,2008,responsibility to report events accurately. Distortions ,UNGD
RUS,2008,of reality hamper international efforts to settle conflicts ,UNGD
RUS,2008,and crises and revive the worst practices of the cold-,UNGD
RUS,2008,war era. If we wish to prevent the truth from becoming ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"the first casualty of war, we must draw the appropriate ",UNGD
RUS,2008,"conclusions, in particular in the light of a provision of ",UNGD
RUS,2008,the 1970 Declaration on Principles of International ,UNGD
RUS,2008,Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation ,UNGD
RUS,2008,among States in accordance with the Charter of the ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"United Nations, which states that States have the duty ",UNGD
RUS,2008,to refrain from propaganda for wars of aggression. ,UNGD
RUS,2008,That is in line with the Guidelines on protecting ,UNGD
RUS,2008,freedom of expression and information in times of ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"crisis, recently adopted by the Committee of Ministers ",UNGD
RUS,2008,of the Council of Europe. I propose that the United ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"Nations also issue a statement on that issue, this time ",UNGD
RUS,2008,in a universal context.  ,UNGD
RUS,2008, The obvious global effects of the crisis in the ,UNGD
RUS,2008,Caucasus show that the world has changed for ,UNGD
RUS,2008,everyone. There are now fewer illusions and fewer ,UNGD
RUS,2008,pretexts for refusing to respond to the most urgent ,UNGD
RUS,2008,challenges of modern times. That is precisely why we ,UNGD
RUS,2008,"hope that the international community will, on the ",UNGD
RUS,2008,"basis of common sense, finally manage to develop a ",UNGD
RUS,2008,programme of collective action for the twenty-first ,UNGD
RUS,2008,century. ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"Today, ",UNGD
RUS,2009,"speaking from this high rostrum, I would like to ",UNGD
RUS,2009,"highlight five topics that are, in my view, important to ",UNGD
RUS,2009,all of us and our common approaches to the ,UNGD
RUS,2009,international agenda. ,UNGD
RUS,2009, The first is the timing of this meeting and the ,UNGD
RUS,2009,moment that humankind is currently experiencing. This ,UNGD
RUS,2009,session of the General Assembly is taking place at a ,UNGD
RUS,2009,very critical and complex time. It can be said without ,UNGD
RUS,2009,exaggeration that we are living through one of the ,UNGD
RUS,2009,watershed moments of modern history. Besides the ,UNGD
RUS,2009,economic crisis — the first large-scale crisis of the era ,UNGD
RUS,2009,of globalization — global development as a whole ,UNGD
RUS,2009,continues to be threatened by regional and local ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"conflicts, terrorism, cross-border crime, food shortages ",UNGD
RUS,2009,and climate change. The impact of the crisis continues ,UNGD
RUS,2009,to be felt by most countries of the world. Although so ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"far we have been able, it seems, to avoid the very worst ",UNGD
RUS,2009,"scenarios, the question remains: how to overcome the ",UNGD
RUS,2009,huge imbalances and deficits — amounting to trillions ,UNGD
RUS,2009,of dollars — accumulated in the global and national ,UNGD
RUS,2009,economies. ,UNGD
RUS,2009, Our collective agenda for unification has been ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"dictated by life itself, which also dictates the growing ",UNGD
RUS,2009,need for the United Nations as a time-tested ,UNGD
RUS,2009,mechanism for harmonizing the interests of different ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"States and peoples. As never before, we are feeling the ",UNGD
RUS,2009,need for informal collective leadership and for an ,UNGD
RUS,2009,increased role for such platforms as the G-8 and the ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"more recent G-20, as well as other negotiation and ",UNGD
RUS,2009,"mediation forums, and all the more because these ",UNGD
RUS,2009,"operate not on a model of opposition, but rather to ",UNGD
RUS,2009,advance the converging interests of their participants. ,UNGD
RUS,2009," At this morning’s meeting, the President of the ",UNGD
RUS,2009,"United States addressed this Assembly, and I would ",UNGD
RUS,2009,like to endorse one of the thoughts he voiced. He stated ,UNGD
RUS,2009,that no single country can or should attempt to ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"dominate others, and that is absolutely true. However, ",UNGD
RUS,2009,these agreed approaches need to be implemented in ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"some way, including through the United Nations ",UNGD
RUS,2009,system. ,UNGD
RUS,2009, Another distinctive feature of modern times is the ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"increasing role of regional entities, which are growing ",UNGD
RUS,2009,more active on every continent. This trend is entirely ,UNGD
RUS,2009,consistent with the principles of the United Nations. ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"Russia, for its part — together with its partners in the ",UNGD
RUS,2009,"Commonwealth of Independent States, in the ",UNGD
RUS,2009,"framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, ",UNGD
RUS,2009,"and with its fellow BRIC countries Brazil, India and ",UNGD
RUS,2009,China — will continue to bolster the mechanisms of ,UNGD
RUS,2009,regional interaction. These mechanisms facilitate a ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"collective response to common threats, while ",UNGD
RUS,2009,mitigating the consequences of the crisis for our ,UNGD
RUS,2009,citizens and increasing the sustainability of our ,UNGD
RUS,2009,national economies. ,UNGD
RUS,2009," Secondly, I want to touch on the issue of existing ",UNGD
RUS,2009,problems. Allow me to dwell on those that cannot be ,UNGD
RUS,2009,effectively addressed without the participation or ,UNGD
RUS,2009,outside the framework of the United Nations. The first ,UNGD
RUS,2009,task in this regard is to address the imbalance of ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"existing mechanisms of global economic governance, ",UNGD
RUS,2009,"the inadequacy of their rules of the game, and the ",UNGD
RUS,2009,chasm between the financial markets and the real ,UNGD
RUS,2009,economy. We need to make joint efforts to establish ,UNGD
RUS,2009,financial and economic models that will protect all of ,UNGD
RUS,2009,us from such turmoil in the future. ,UNGD
RUS,2009, Virtually all countries have seen a drop in output ,UNGD
RUS,2009,and in the standards of living of millions of their ,UNGD
RUS,2009, ,UNGD
RUS,2009, ,UNGD
RUS,2009,17 09-52228 ,UNGD
RUS,2009, ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"citizens. The crisis has exacerbated social problems, ",UNGD
RUS,2009,painfully tested young people at the very start of their ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"lives, and caused significant growth in unemployment ",UNGD
RUS,2009,in all countries. Russia is no exception in this. ,UNGD
RUS,2009, A painful blow has been delivered to our plans to ,UNGD
RUS,2009,alleviate poverty. A real threat of disruption of the ,UNGD
RUS,2009,Millennium Development Goals has emerged. We must ,UNGD
RUS,2009,do our utmost to prevent such a development. Donor ,UNGD
RUS,2009,assistance to countries in need cannot be postponed ,UNGD
RUS,2009,until some other time. The tasks set out as a priority by ,UNGD
RUS,2009,the international community must absolutely be ,UNGD
RUS,2009,addressed. The arrangements adopted at the G-20 ,UNGD
RUS,2009,summits and the United Nations Conference on the ,UNGD
RUS,2009,World Financial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on ,UNGD
RUS,2009,Development must be implemented — and they must ,UNGD
RUS,2009,be implemented within the deadlines that we ourselves ,UNGD
RUS,2009,set. ,UNGD
RUS,2009, The second major task in this context is to ,UNGD
RUS,2009,address the issues of global energy security. Three ,UNGD
RUS,2009,years ago at the Saint Petersburg G-8 summit in ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"Russia, the principles for a new legal framework for ",UNGD
RUS,2009,such cooperation were formulated. The goal is to ,UNGD
RUS,2009,harmonize the interests of all participants in the energy ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"chain: suppliers, consumers and intermediaries or ",UNGD
RUS,2009,transiters. It was not so long ago that we solidified ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"these principles, and we invite all States to engage in ",UNGD
RUS,2009,discussion on them. We believe that such discussions ,UNGD
RUS,2009,should be conducted with the active involvement of ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"specialized multilateral institutions, including, of ",UNGD
RUS,2009,"course, the agencies of the United Nations family. ",UNGD
RUS,2009, The third task that Russia deems to be potentially ,UNGD
RUS,2009,critical is the comprehensive strengthening of the ,UNGD
RUS,2009,United Nations itself. The United Nations must adapt ,UNGD
RUS,2009,itself in a rational way to the new global realities. It ,UNGD
RUS,2009,should strengthen its influence while preserving its ,UNGD
RUS,2009,multinational nature and the integrity of the Charter’s ,UNGD
RUS,2009,key provisions. The most important component of the ,UNGD
RUS,2009,revitalization of the United Nations is reform of the ,UNGD
RUS,2009,Security Council. The time has come to speed up the ,UNGD
RUS,2009,search for a compromise formula for the Security ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"Council’s expansion, and of course to increase its ",UNGD
RUS,2009,efficiency. ,UNGD
RUS,2009, The third issue I want to touch on is ,UNGD
RUS,2009,disarmament. The process of multilateral disarmament ,UNGD
RUS,2009,under United Nations auspices is an extremely ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"important task. There are grounds for hope since, as ",UNGD
RUS,2009,"members are aware, a number of positive trends have ",UNGD
RUS,2009,emerged in overcoming the protracted crisis. The ,UNGD
RUS,2009,Conference on Disarmament in Geneva has adopted its ,UNGD
RUS,2009,programme of work. I should also like to mention the ,UNGD
RUS,2009,Russian-Chinese initiative to develop a treaty to ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"prevent the deployment of weapons in outer space, as ",UNGD
RUS,2009,well as our current proposal to universalize the ,UNGD
RUS,2009,Russian-American Treaty on the Elimination of ,UNGD
RUS,2009,Intermediate-range and Shorter-range Missiles. ,UNGD
RUS,2009, Russia will unswervingly follow the path of ,UNGD
RUS,2009,verifiable and irreversible reductions in nuclear ,UNGD
RUS,2009,weapons as an essential element of a new start in our ,UNGD
RUS,2009,relations with the United States. In Moscow in July this ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"year, President Obama and I not only signed a relevant ",UNGD
RUS,2009,"document, but also agreed on a mandate for further ",UNGD
RUS,2009,"negotiations to elaborate a new, legally binding treaty. ",UNGD
RUS,2009,This treaty should replace the Treaty on the Reduction ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, which ",UNGD
RUS,2009,expires in December. ,UNGD
RUS,2009, Of special importance here is the relationship ,UNGD
RUS,2009,between strategic offensive and defensive arms. In my ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"meeting with President Obama this morning, we ",UNGD
RUS,2009,discussed the recently announced adjustments to the ,UNGD
RUS,2009,United States’ planned development of a missile ,UNGD
RUS,2009,defence system. I should like to state in this highest of ,UNGD
RUS,2009,forums that we view this decision as a constructive step ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"in the right direction, which has deservedly received ",UNGD
RUS,2009,numerous expressions of support from the international ,UNGD
RUS,2009,community. Russia is ready to engage in detailed ,UNGD
RUS,2009,discussions with the American side and to undertake ,UNGD
RUS,2009,relevant initiatives in this field in order to reach ,UNGD
RUS,2009,mutually acceptable agreement. ,UNGD
RUS,2009, Without resolving such problems as missile ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"defence and non-nuclear strategic offensive arms, it ",UNGD
RUS,2009,will be simply impossible to achieve real progress in ,UNGD
RUS,2009,the field of nuclear disarmament. I believe that the ,UNGD
RUS,2009,work on this new treaty will be fully consistent with ,UNGD
RUS,2009,relevant provisions of the joint document endorsed by ,UNGD
RUS,2009,the President of the United States and myself at our ,UNGD
RUS,2009,meeting in Moscow. ,UNGD
RUS,2009, We believe that other nuclear States should join ,UNGD
RUS,2009,the disarmament efforts of Russia and the United ,UNGD
RUS,2009,States. There is no need to wait for further progress in ,UNGD
RUS,2009,the Russian-American disarmament process. We can ,UNGD
RUS,2009,begin forthwith to elaborate acceptable and practical ,UNGD
RUS,2009,arrangements that take into account the differences in ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"the size of potentials. In that respect, we could draw on ",UNGD
RUS,2009,"international experience in the twentieth century, for ",UNGD
RUS,2009,example the 1921-1922 Washington Conference on ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"naval armaments, where participants agreed on the ",UNGD
RUS,2009,  ,UNGD
RUS,2009, ,UNGD
RUS,2009,09-52228 18 ,UNGD
RUS,2009, ,UNGD
RUS,2009,maximum size of their fleets without insisting on parity ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"in absolute terms. If we take the same approach today, ",UNGD
RUS,2009,"based on the current status of nuclear arsenals, we ",UNGD
RUS,2009,could send the rest of the world a sure signal that the ,UNGD
RUS,2009,unaccounted numbers will be added to the equation of ,UNGD
RUS,2009,strategic stability. ,UNGD
RUS,2009," Pursuing nuclear disarmament, strengthening the ",UNGD
RUS,2009,nuclear non-proliferation regime and promoting the ,UNGD
RUS,2009,peaceful use of nuclear energy will be at the very heart ,UNGD
RUS,2009,of the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the ,UNGD
RUS,2009,Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ,UNGD
RUS,2009,(NPT). We cherish the hope that it will be successful. ,UNGD
RUS,2009, The global nuclear security summit scheduled for ,UNGD
RUS,2009,April 2010 will provide a good opportunity for a more ,UNGD
RUS,2009,detailed discussion of these issues. We support that ,UNGD
RUS,2009,initiative. We have also agreed with the United States ,UNGD
RUS,2009,Administration on joint steps for further progress on ,UNGD
RUS,2009,such aspects of nuclear security as the prevention of ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"nuclear terrorism, expanding access to the benefits of ",UNGD
RUS,2009,peaceful nuclear energy to all signatories implementing ,UNGD
RUS,2009,the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"Weapons in good faith, and other decisions. We call for ",UNGD
RUS,2009,collective cooperation on these matters. ,UNGD
RUS,2009, In order to reach a common understanding on ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"such important issues, we must engage all nations  ",UNGD
RUS,2009,and influential international organizations in the ,UNGD
RUS,2009,aforementioned negotiation processes. The international ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"community, it must be said, has at its disposal such ",UNGD
RUS,2009,tried and tested measures for enhancing regional and ,UNGD
RUS,2009,international security as nuclear-weapon-free zones. In ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"particular, there is a very pressing need to establish a ",UNGD
RUS,2009,zone in the Middle East free of all types of weapons of ,UNGD
RUS,2009,mass destruction and their means of delivery. This is a ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"long-standing issue, with respect to which a resolution ",UNGD
RUS,2009,was adopted at the 1995 NPT Review Conference. ,UNGD
RUS,2009," Russia, as a member of the Quartet of ",UNGD
RUS,2009,"international mediators on the Middle East settlement, ",UNGD
RUS,2009,has consistently supported efforts to strengthen the ,UNGD
RUS,2009,nuclear non-proliferation regime in the Middle East. ,UNGD
RUS,2009,Russia has made specific proposals within the ,UNGD
RUS,2009,framework of the NPT review process to seek mutually ,UNGD
RUS,2009,acceptable ways of implementing earlier decisions on ,UNGD
RUS,2009,this matter. All countries of the region need to take an ,UNGD
RUS,2009,active stance on this issue and demonstrate their ,UNGD
RUS,2009,willingness to achieve that end. ,UNGD
RUS,2009, We also need to accelerate work towards a ,UNGD
RUS,2009,mechanism to ensure peace and security in North-East ,UNGD
RUS,2009,Asia. Russia has made proposals in this regard to the ,UNGD
RUS,2009,participants in the Six-Party Talks. In the present ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"circumstances, this task is more urgent than ever. ",UNGD
RUS,2009, The fourth topic I wish to address is that of ,UNGD
RUS,2009,regional conflicts and regional security. We intend to ,UNGD
RUS,2009,continue to participate in the search for effective ,UNGD
RUS,2009,options for settling regional conflicts. We are ,UNGD
RUS,2009,convinced that the use of force can only exacerbate ,UNGD
RUS,2009,such situations. That was demonstrated by the reckless ,UNGD
RUS,2009,attempt by the Georgian authorities last year to resolve ,UNGD
RUS,2009,the problems in their relations with South Ossetia by ,UNGD
RUS,2009,military means. ,UNGD
RUS,2009," At that time, in August 2008, we came very close ",UNGD
RUS,2009,to a situation in which a local armed conflict had the ,UNGD
RUS,2009,potential to grow into a full-scale war. I am certain that ,UNGD
RUS,2009,this is clearly understood by everyone in this Hall ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"today. In order to ensure that this should never recur, ",UNGD
RUS,2009,we need clear and effective mechanisms to implement ,UNGD
RUS,2009,the principle of the indivisibility of security. Without ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"such a mechanism, we will not be able to move beyond ",UNGD
RUS,2009,the legacy of the past or overcome existing prejudices. ,UNGD
RUS,2009,I wish to stress that irresponsible regimes should not ,UNGD
RUS,2009,have any opportunity whatsoever to foment disputes ,UNGD
RUS,2009,among other countries. ,UNGD
RUS,2009, The role and place of the modern nation in ,UNGD
RUS,2009,ensuring global security is a topic of the greatest ,UNGD
RUS,2009,relevance today. We have witnessed situations time and ,UNGD
RUS,2009,again in which problems emerging within the confines ,UNGD
RUS,2009,of an individual State have acquired a regional or even ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"global character. The incompetence and, very often, ",UNGD
RUS,2009,ineffectiveness of national Government institutions can ,UNGD
RUS,2009,have consequences that are fraught with risks for ,UNGD
RUS,2009,several countries. The prevention of such an outcome ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"is of course a very complex and sensitive issue, but one ",UNGD
RUS,2009,upon which we must deliberate together. ,UNGD
RUS,2009, These issues were the focus of discussions at a ,UNGD
RUS,2009,recent conference held in Russia. The outcome was ,UNGD
RUS,2009,quite clear. What we require in the future is a smart ,UNGD
RUS,2009,foreign policy. The current global crisis is not limited ,UNGD
RUS,2009,to economics; it is also a crisis of ideas. It is the ,UNGD
RUS,2009,accumulation of a critical mass of outdated policies ,UNGD
RUS,2009,and development models. ,UNGD
RUS,2009, Having developed the initiative to sign a new ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"European security treaty, Russia has proposed taking a ",UNGD
RUS,2009,"fresh approach to this problem and, above all, ",UNGD
RUS,2009,abandoning outdated policies. We all hope that the cold ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"war has been left behind, but the world has not become ",UNGD
RUS,2009,more secure. What we need today are modern solutions ,UNGD
RUS,2009,and clear legal frameworks for implementing existing ,UNGD
RUS,2009, ,UNGD
RUS,2009, ,UNGD
RUS,2009,19 09-52228 ,UNGD
RUS,2009, ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"political commitments. We do not need declarations, ",UNGD
RUS,2009,appeals or demagogues; what we need are clear legal ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"frameworks, including to enshrine the principle under ",UNGD
RUS,2009,international law that one must not seek to ensure one’s ,UNGD
RUS,2009,own security at the expense of the security of others. ,UNGD
RUS,2009, Our initiative concerns the Euro-Atlantic space. ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"However, its key provision on the indivisibility of ",UNGD
RUS,2009,security is a universal principle that is applicable to all ,UNGD
RUS,2009,regions of the world and is fully consistent with the ,UNGD
RUS,2009,letter and spirit of the United Nations Charter. The ,UNGD
RUS,2009,principle of the indivisibility of security should be an ,UNGD
RUS,2009,integral part of current international law. ,UNGD
RUS,2009, Values are the last issue that I wish to mention ,UNGD
RUS,2009,from this rostrum. The protection of human rights and ,UNGD
RUS,2009,interests and the universal application of commonly ,UNGD
RUS,2009,recognized norms and principles in that area should be ,UNGD
RUS,2009,the basis for strengthening trust and stability in ,UNGD
RUS,2009,international relations. We are all united by values that ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"are rooted in morality, religion, customs and traditions. ",UNGD
RUS,2009,I am talking about such fundamental concepts as the ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"right to life, tolerance of dissent, responsibility towards ",UNGD
RUS,2009,"one’s family, charity and compassion, which are the ",UNGD
RUS,2009,foundation both of daily life and of relations among ,UNGD
RUS,2009,States. ,UNGD
RUS,2009," However, unfortunately, it is the reality that the ",UNGD
RUS,2009,world is witnessing growing nationalism and numerous ,UNGD
RUS,2009,manifestations of religious intolerance and hatred. That ,UNGD
RUS,2009,is why we believe that establishing a high-level group ,UNGD
RUS,2009,on interfaith dialogue under the Director-General of ,UNGD
RUS,2009,UNESCO is extremely valuable. It is particularly ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"relevant on the eve of 2010, which the United Nations ",UNGD
RUS,2009,has declared International Year for the Rapprochement ,UNGD
RUS,2009,of Cultures. ,UNGD
RUS,2009," To conclude, I cannot fail to mention, as I stand ",UNGD
RUS,2009,"here, another topic that is very close to the heart of all ",UNGD
RUS,2009,citizens of our country and all peoples of the world. ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"Next year, we are going to celebrate the sixty-fifth ",UNGD
RUS,2009,anniversary of the end of the Second World War. ,UNGD
RUS,2009,Russia put forward a proposal to adopt a relevant ,UNGD
RUS,2009,General Assembly resolution and to hold a special ,UNGD
RUS,2009,session to commemorate all victims of that war in May ,UNGD
RUS,2009,next year. We cannot allow its horrible lessons to be ,UNGD
RUS,2009,forgotten. ,UNGD
RUS,2009," However, from time to time we see neo-fascist ",UNGD
RUS,2009,"organizations raise their heads. Racial, national and ",UNGD
RUS,2009,ethnic crimes are being committed. Attempts are being ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"made to whitewash Nazism, to deny the Holocaust and ",UNGD
RUS,2009,to review the decisions of the Nuremberg Tribunal. I ,UNGD
RUS,2009,am convinced that strong and joint resistance to ,UNGD
RUS,2009,manifestations of neo-Nazism and to attempts to revise ,UNGD
RUS,2009,the results of the Second World War enshrined in the ,UNGD
RUS,2009,United Nations Charter should remain a priority task of ,UNGD
RUS,2009,the Organization. ,UNGD
RUS,2009, The creation of the United Nations was one of the ,UNGD
RUS,2009,principal achievements of the international community ,UNGD
RUS,2009,in the twentieth century. This Organization and its ,UNGD
RUS,2009,fruitful activities have become a symbol of the ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"twentieth century, and there is simply no alternative to ",UNGD
RUS,2009,these activities. We have no right to forget that the ,UNGD
RUS,2009,United Nations possesses unique international ,UNGD
RUS,2009,"legitimacy, and we all must preserve and strengthen ",UNGD
RUS,2009,this shared wealth of the peoples of the world. ,UNGD
RUS,2010,"The current, sixty-fifth session of the ",UNGD
RUS,2010,General Assembly has started with an unprecedented ,UNGD
RUS,2010,number of events covering the full range of the most ,UNGD
RUS,2010,"topical international issues. It is encouraging that, in ",UNGD
RUS,2010,"the light of the numerous challenges facing mankind, a ",UNGD
RUS,2010,positive unified platform for collective action has been ,UNGD
RUS,2010,"taking shape, with the United Nations playing the ",UNGD
RUS,2010,central role. Having learned from the dramatic events ,UNGD
RUS,2010,of recent decades and having realized that attempts to ,UNGD
RUS,2010,cut the Gordian knot by force in violation of the ,UNGD
RUS,2010,"Charter will only lead to deadlock, the international ",UNGD
RUS,2010,community has concluded that there is no alternative ,UNGD
RUS,2010,"but to address political, economic and other problems ",UNGD
RUS,2010,through joint efforts based on international law. And ,UNGD
RUS,2010,the United Nations provides a universal platform to ,UNGD
RUS,2010,strengthen this positive trend in international relations.  ,UNGD
RUS,2010, The Security Council is a key instrument of this ,UNGD
RUS,2010,Organization to maintain international peace and ,UNGD
RUS,2010,security. The high-level Security Council meeting held ,UNGD
RUS,2010,on 23 September (S/PV.6389) reaffirmed its members’ ,UNGD
RUS,2010,"intention to enhance that body’s efficiency, not only ",UNGD
RUS,2010,through direct involvement in conflict settlement but ,UNGD
RUS,2010,also by creating prerequisites for the non-recurrence ,UNGD
RUS,2010,and prevention of crises. This proves that the ,UNGD
RUS,2010,comprehensive approach to ensuring international ,UNGD
RUS,2010,"security is gaining ground, as it reflects modern ",UNGD
RUS,2010,realities and is based on the principles and provisions ,UNGD
RUS,2010,of the United Nations Charter. ,UNGD
RUS,2010," The United Nations faces unprecedented, serious ",UNGD
RUS,2010,and multifaceted tasks in the key area of peacekeeping. ,UNGD
RUS,2010,While paying tribute to the efforts and sacrifice of ,UNGD
RUS,2010,"thousands of men and women Blue Helmets, joint ",UNGD
RUS,2010,efforts should continue to refine the theory and practice ,UNGD
RUS,2010,of peacekeeping under United Nations auspices and to ,UNGD
RUS,2010,improve the quality of planning and the conduct of ,UNGD
RUS,2010,peacekeeping operations with adequate political ,UNGD
RUS,2010,control by the Security Council. ,UNGD
RUS,2010, It is encouraging that the United Nations is ,UNGD
RUS,2010,working towards this goal on a truly collective basis. ,UNGD
RUS,2010,Member States have quite a few constructive ideas on ,UNGD
RUS,2010,"their table, which include Russia’s initiative to ",UNGD
RUS,2010,revitalize the Military Staff Committee in order to ,UNGD
RUS,2010,improve the military expertise of Security Council ,UNGD
RUS,2010,decisions. ,UNGD
RUS,2010, This year has been marked by progress in nuclear ,UNGD
RUS,2010,disarmament. The 2010 Treaty between the United ,UNGD
RUS,2010,States of America and the Russian Federation on ,UNGD
RUS,2010,Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of ,UNGD
RUS,2010,"Strategic Offensive Arms, signed by the Presidents of ",UNGD
RUS,2010,"Russia and the United States in Prague, is a real ",UNGD
RUS,2010,contribution by our two countries to strengthening ,UNGD
RUS,2010,international security and strategic stability. It is also ,UNGD
RUS,2010,the result of positive changes in the relations between ,UNGD
RUS,2010,Russia and the United States that have placed Russian-,UNGD
RUS,2010,American interaction in world affairs on a qualitatively ,UNGD
RUS,2010,new level.  ,UNGD
RUS,2010, We hope that the strong impetus provided by ,UNGD
RUS,2010,Moscow and Washington to the nuclear disarmament ,UNGD
RUS,2010,"process will be followed similarly by all nations, ",UNGD
RUS,2010,primarily by nuclear-weapon States. ,UNGD
RUS,2010, Pursuant to Russia’s policy towards strengthening ,UNGD
RUS,2010,"the United Nations role in global security, disarmament ",UNGD
RUS,2010,"and confidence-building, we intend to table three draft ",UNGD
RUS,2010,resolutions during the current General Assembly ,UNGD
RUS,2010,session: one on transparency and confidence-building ,UNGD
RUS,2010,"measures in outer space activities, co-sponsored with ",UNGD
RUS,2010,China; a draft resolution on developments in the field ,UNGD
RUS,2010,of information and telecommunications in the context ,UNGD
RUS,2010,of international security; and a Russia-United States ,UNGD
RUS,2010,co-sponsored draft resolution on bilateral strategic ,UNGD
RUS,2010,offensive arms reductions and the new framework for ,UNGD
RUS,2010,strategic relations. We call for their adoption by ,UNGD
RUS,2010,consensus. ,UNGD
RUS,2010, The universalization of the Treaty on the  ,UNGD
RUS,2010,Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and its ,UNGD
RUS,2010,guaranteed strict implementation comprise the ,UNGD
RUS,2010,cornerstone of a strengthened international  ,UNGD
RUS,2010,"non-proliferation regime. In that context, the search ",UNGD
RUS,2010,must continue for an effective solution to the Iranian ,UNGD
RUS,2010,nuclear problem on the basis of NPT provisions and the ,UNGD
RUS,2010,norms of international Law. The Iranian side must ,UNGD
RUS,2010,ensure the requisite level of transparency and ,UNGD
RUS,2010,cooperation with the International Atomic Energy ,UNGD
RUS,2010,"Agency (IAEA), which is acting on behalf of the ",UNGD
RUS,2010,international community with the Security Council’s ,UNGD
RUS,2010,support. ,UNGD
RUS,2010, Clarifying the outstanding questions about the ,UNGD
RUS,2010,Iranian nuclear programme would not only meet the ,UNGD
RUS,2010,goal of strengthening the non-proliferation regime but ,UNGD
RUS,2010,would also quite obviously promote the interests of ,UNGD
RUS,2010,Iran. Russia sees no reasonable alternative to a political ,UNGD
RUS,2010,and diplomatic settlement of the Iranian nuclear ,UNGD
RUS,2010, ,UNGD
RUS,2010, ,UNGD
RUS,2010,31 10-55396 ,UNGD
RUS,2010, ,UNGD
RUS,2010,problem through constructive dialogue between Tehran ,UNGD
RUS,2010,and the six countries involved. The meeting of the ,UNGD
RUS,2010,Foreign Ministers of the six countries in New York ,UNGD
RUS,2010,helped to consolidate the shared intention to ensure the ,UNGD
RUS,2010,earliest resumption of such a dialogue. We will ,UNGD
RUS,2010,continue to do our utmost to achieve this goal. ,UNGD
RUS,2010," As far as the sanctions instrument is concerned, ",UNGD
RUS,2010,sanctions are not a goal in themselves. The objective of ,UNGD
RUS,2010,the sanctions regime established by the Security ,UNGD
RUS,2010,Council is to signal to Iran that it must fully cooperate ,UNGD
RUS,2010,"with IAEA, and to give an impetus to the negotiating ",UNGD
RUS,2010,process. All members of the international community ,UNGD
RUS,2010,must show solidarity based on mutual responsibility. ,UNGD
RUS,2010,We strongly reject a situation in which unilateral ,UNGD
RUS,2010,decisions — including ex-territorial ones that undermine ,UNGD
RUS,2010,the very foundation of further joint efforts — are made ,UNGD
RUS,2010,with regard to sanctions in parallel to collective efforts ,UNGD
RUS,2010,by the United Nations Security Council. We must put ,UNGD
RUS,2010,"an end to that practice, which runs counter to ",UNGD
RUS,2010,international law and has negative political effects. ,UNGD
RUS,2010," Even more obvious, the economic and financial ",UNGD
RUS,2010,"trade blockade of Cuba, whose lifting the General ",UNGD
RUS,2010,"Assembly has demanded for a number of years, is ",UNGD
RUS,2010,clearly an anachronism. The codification of the ,UNGD
RUS,2010,principle of equal and indivisible security is ,UNGD
RUS,2010,indispensable to productive international efforts in this ,UNGD
RUS,2010,"field, which is the precise goal of President ",UNGD
RUS,2010,Medvedev’s initiative to conclude a treaty on European ,UNGD
RUS,2010,security. The proposal targets the complete transition of ,UNGD
RUS,2010,Euro-Atlantic policy from its old Cold War agenda to a ,UNGD
RUS,2010,"new one, as well as a firm legal foundation for the ",UNGD
RUS,2010,principle of indivisible security for all in the  ,UNGD
RUS,2010,Euro-Atlantic region proclaimed in the 1990s. We ,UNGD
RUS,2010,welcome the substantive dialogue on this important ,UNGD
RUS,2010,"Russian initiative, which has started in various ",UNGD
RUS,2010,international forums. ,UNGD
RUS,2010, A comprehensive settlement in the Middle East ,UNGD
RUS,2010,would make a crucial contribution towards ,UNGD
RUS,2010,strengthened global stability. The parties must ,UNGD
RUS,2010,demonstrate political will and extend every effort to ,UNGD
RUS,2010,promote the success of the resumed direct Palestinian-,UNGD
RUS,2010,Israeli talks. The results of the ministerial Quartet ,UNGD
RUS,2010,meeting of major international mediators held on  ,UNGD
RUS,2010,21 September demonstrated that appropriate support to ,UNGD
RUS,2010,"the Israelis and Palestinians will continue, but the ",UNGD
RUS,2010,ultimate responsibility for a successful outcome rests ,UNGD
RUS,2010,with them. ,UNGD
RUS,2010," In this connection, the decision by the Israeli ",UNGD
RUS,2010,authorities to not extend the moratorium on Israeli ,UNGD
RUS,2010,settlement activities has raised serious concern. A way ,UNGD
RUS,2010,out of the current impasse should be found so as to ,UNGD
RUS,2010,ensure that negotiations continue. Our proposal to hold ,UNGD
RUS,2010,an international conference on the Middle East in ,UNGD
RUS,2010,Moscow is aimed at advancing the Middle East ,UNGD
RUS,2010,settlement. This proposal has gained the support of all ,UNGD
RUS,2010,interested parties and the United Nations Security ,UNGD
RUS,2010,Council. If the direct Palestinian-Israeli dialogue ,UNGD
RUS,2010,"becomes stable, the preparations for the Moscow forum ",UNGD
RUS,2010,"can get under way, which should also substantively ",UNGD
RUS,2010,"examine the Syrian and Lebanese tracks, as well as the ",UNGD
RUS,2010,prospects for the multilateral aspects of the Middle ,UNGD
RUS,2010,East settlement. ,UNGD
RUS,2010, The development of a comprehensive strategy to ,UNGD
RUS,2010,address the interconnected problems of the Middle East ,UNGD
RUS,2010,is on the agenda. It is necessary to continue working ,UNGD
RUS,2010,towards an international conference in 2012 on the ,UNGD
RUS,2010,establishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons and ,UNGD
RUS,2010,other weapons of mass destruction and their means of ,UNGD
RUS,2010,"delivery in the Middle East, pursuant to the decision of ",UNGD
RUS,2010,the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on ,UNGD
RUS,2010,the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. ,UNGD
RUS,2010, Russia supports the international strategy for a ,UNGD
RUS,2010,comprehensive settlement and for post-conflict ,UNGD
RUS,2010,rehabilitation of Afghanistan adopted by the Kabul ,UNGD
RUS,2010,"Conference, which envisages a stage-by-stage transfer ",UNGD
RUS,2010,of responsibility for the situation in that country to ,UNGD
RUS,2010,"Afghan authorities, as effective governing structures ",UNGD
RUS,2010,are established in the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. ,UNGD
RUS,2010,The future of Afghanistan must be determined by the ,UNGD
RUS,2010,Afghan people themselves. The international ,UNGD
RUS,2010,"community must continue to provide its assistance, ",UNGD
RUS,2010,with an important role being played by the United ,UNGD
RUS,2010,Nations. ,UNGD
RUS,2010, Lasting stabilization in Afghanistan and ,UNGD
RUS,2010,throughout the region will be impossible without ,UNGD
RUS,2010,resolving the drug problem. The dimension of the ,UNGD
RUS,2010,danger posed by narcotics emanating from Afghanistan ,UNGD
RUS,2010,represents a clear threat to international peace and ,UNGD
RUS,2010,stability and requires more resolute actions throughout ,UNGD
RUS,2010,the entire chain of the production and proliferation of ,UNGD
RUS,2010,narcotics — from the destruction of drug crops to the ,UNGD
RUS,2010,"suppression of precursor supplies, including drug ",UNGD
RUS,2010,traffickers on the sanction lists of the Security Council. ,UNGD
RUS,2010,It is also necessary to move to a new level of ,UNGD
RUS,2010,international cooperation. Russia’s initiative to ,UNGD
RUS,2010,establish financial and counter-narcotics security belts ,UNGD
RUS,2010,  ,UNGD
RUS,2010, ,UNGD
RUS,2010,10-55396 32 ,UNGD
RUS,2010, ,UNGD
RUS,2010,along the perimeter of Afghan’s borders is consistent ,UNGD
RUS,2010,with those goals. ,UNGD
RUS,2010, The regional dimension of the long-term ,UNGD
RUS,2010,stabilization of Afghanistan is becoming ever more ,UNGD
RUS,2010,"topical. To that end, we must fully engage the potential ",UNGD
RUS,2010,of relevant organizations that are actively working in ,UNGD
RUS,2010,"close contact with Kabul on Afghan issues, including ",UNGD
RUS,2010,the Collective Security Treaty Organization and the ,UNGD
RUS,2010,Shanghai Cooperation Organization. ,UNGD
RUS,2010, The settlement process in the Sudan is ,UNGD
RUS,2010,approaching an important milestone. As the date of ,UNGD
RUS,2010,referendum on the self-determination of the South of ,UNGD
RUS,2010,"that country draws closer, the parties to the ",UNGD
RUS,2010,Comprehensive Peace Agreement must redouble their ,UNGD
RUS,2010,efforts to overcome the problems that still divide them. ,UNGD
RUS,2010,We should also give new impetus to the Darfur ,UNGD
RUS,2010,settlement process. At stake is the stability of ,UNGD
RUS,2010,conditions in the Sudan and throughout the vast ,UNGD
RUS,2010,African continent. We welcome the constructive ,UNGD
RUS,2010,attitude demonstrated by the Sudanese and other ,UNGD
RUS,2010,participants in the high-level meeting on the Sudan that ,UNGD
RUS,2010,was held here recently. ,UNGD
RUS,2010," In Somalia, the confrontation continues between ",UNGD
RUS,2010,"the Transitional Federal Government, supported by the ",UNGD
RUS,2010,"international community, and extremists and terrorist ",UNGD
RUS,2010,groups linked with Al-Qaida. The lack of a settlement ,UNGD
RUS,2010,on land is fuelling the problem of piracy off the coast ,UNGD
RUS,2010,of Somalia. A more resolute pursuit of the political ,UNGD
RUS,2010,process and stronger assistance to the peacekeeping ,UNGD
RUS,2010,operation of the African Union and further counter-,UNGD
RUS,2010,"piracy efforts, including the criminal prosecution of ",UNGD
RUS,2010,"pirates, are priorities in international efforts on the ",UNGD
RUS,2010,"Somali track, as reiterated during the recent  ",UNGD
RUS,2010,"mini-summit on Somalia, which Russia fully supports. ",UNGD
RUS,2010, The results of the Millennium Development ,UNGD
RUS,2010,Goals summit have reaffirmed the important role of the ,UNGD
RUS,2010,United Nations on development matters and must help ,UNGD
RUS,2010,mobilize political support and financial resources for ,UNGD
RUS,2010,the timely achievement of the Millennium ,UNGD
RUS,2010,Development Goals (MDGs). That requires joint ,UNGD
RUS,2010,"efforts by Governments, international financial and ",UNGD
RUS,2010,"trade institutions, the private sector and civil society, ",UNGD
RUS,2010,based on the principles of global partnership and ,UNGD
RUS,2010,shared responsibility. ,UNGD
RUS,2010," It is obvious that most global problems, including ",UNGD
RUS,2010,"the achievement of the MDGs, cannot be resolved ",UNGD
RUS,2010,"without engaging innovations, advanced technologies ",UNGD
RUS,2010,and modernization solutions. The same is valid for ,UNGD
RUS,2010,"such challenges as climate change, energy and food ",UNGD
RUS,2010,security and the fight against diseases. The engagement ,UNGD
RUS,2010,"of the enormous potential of the United Nations, its ",UNGD
RUS,2010,family and system of specialized agencies in this area ,UNGD
RUS,2010,will allow the Organization to become a catalyst in the ,UNGD
RUS,2010,establishment and development of multilateral ,UNGD
RUS,2010,modernization alliances. Russia is prepared to ,UNGD
RUS,2010,participate actively in that work. ,UNGD
RUS,2010," To live up to expectations, the United Nations must ",UNGD
RUS,2010,continuously renew itself. The reform of the Organization ,UNGD
RUS,2010,"is progressively moving forward. This year, the ",UNGD
RUS,2010,negotiations on strengthening system-wide coherence ,UNGD
RUS,2010,"were completed successfully. In particular, the new ",UNGD
RUS,2010,important United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and ,UNGD
RUS,2010,the Empowerment of Women has been established. ,UNGD
RUS,2010, Negotiations will continue at the current session ,UNGD
RUS,2010,of the General Assembly on the expansion of the ,UNGD
RUS,2010,composition of the Security Council. This is an ,UNGD
RUS,2010,extremely important issue on the reform agenda of the ,UNGD
RUS,2010,"Organization, involving the interests of the ",UNGD
RUS,2010,"overwhelming majority of States. For that reason, the ",UNGD
RUS,2010,final formula for Security Council reform should be ,UNGD
RUS,2010,based on compromise and the broadest possible ,UNGD
RUS,2010,agreement in the United Nations. This requirement is ,UNGD
RUS,2010,also fully applicable to all other aspects of United ,UNGD
RUS,2010,Nations reform. ,UNGD
RUS,2010, This year marks the sixty-fifth anniversary of the ,UNGD
RUS,2010,"United Nations, as well as that of the end of the Second ",UNGD
RUS,2010,"World War, from the ashes of which the world ",UNGD
RUS,2010,Organization was born. For the sake of the memory of ,UNGD
RUS,2010,the millions of victims and in order to prevent a ,UNGD
RUS,2010,"repetition of such scourges, we must suppress attempts ",UNGD
RUS,2010,to falsify the events associated with that historic ,UNGD
RUS,2010,calamity. That is the aim of a well-known Russian ,UNGD
RUS,2010,initiative in the United Nations. We count on the ,UNGD
RUS,2010,broadest support for a draft resolution on the topic. ,UNGD
RUS,2010, The United Nations is our common and unique ,UNGD
RUS,2010,Organization. It is up to all of us to determine how ,UNGD
RUS,2010,productive and really useful its future work will be for ,UNGD
RUS,2010,"humankind. By pulling our efforts together, we will be ",UNGD
RUS,2010,able to renew the United Nations effectively and ,UNGD
RUS,2010,provide it with all the necessary resources. We are ,UNGD
RUS,2010,convinced that reasonable resources spent on that goal ,UNGD
RUS,2010,will bring tangible dividends to all members of the ,UNGD
RUS,2010,"international community in the form of durable peace, ",UNGD
RUS,2010,"security, cooperation and prosperity all over the globe.",UNGD
RUS,2011,This year the session of the General ,UNGD
RUS,2011,Assembly is opening at a time when international ,UNGD
RUS,2011,relations are in a state of turbulence. The Middle East ,UNGD
RUS,2011,and North Africa have gone through a period of large-,UNGD
RUS,2011,"scale changes, and the situation is volatile in certain ",UNGD
RUS,2011,other parts of the world. We have not yet been able to ,UNGD
RUS,2011,put the global economy back on the track of ,UNGD
RUS,2011,progressive sustainable development. The increasing ,UNGD
RUS,2011,number of alarming factors has been accompanied by ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"an exacerbation of social, inter-ethnic and intercultural ",UNGD
RUS,2011,conflicts as well as outbreaks of extremism. ,UNGD
RUS,2011, Just as a ship caught in adverse weather ,UNGD
RUS,2011,conditions needs a united crew and a compass to find ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"the right course, the international community today ",UNGD
RUS,2011,needs in particular to deploy joint efforts to respond to ,UNGD
RUS,2011,common challenges and set clear guidelines to ,UNGD
RUS,2011,strengthen global governance mechanisms. We are ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"convinced that such guidelines should include, first and ",UNGD
RUS,2011,"foremost, the rule of international law; clear, strict and ",UNGD
RUS,2011,responsible reliance on the fundamental principles of ,UNGD
RUS,2011,the Charter of the United Nations; and the will to ,UNGD
RUS,2011,implement a positive unification agenda. ,UNGD
RUS,2011, The United Nations remains a pillar of ,UNGD
RUS,2011,international relations and equitable multilateral ,UNGD
RUS,2011,cooperation in the interests of all States. It has a unique ,UNGD
RUS,2011,legitimacy and the necessary authority to respond ,UNGD
RUS,2011,adequately to the variety of contemporary risks and ,UNGD
RUS,2011,threats. It is the United Nations that should continue to ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"provide political, legal and moral leadership in dealing ",UNGD
RUS,2011,"with global challenges, to establish equitable principles ",UNGD
RUS,2011,"and standards of interaction, to monitor their ",UNGD
RUS,2011,implementation and to render necessary assistance and ,UNGD
RUS,2011,support for the States that need it. ,UNGD
RUS,2011," Ten years ago on September 11, a horrible ",UNGD
RUS,2011,terrorist attack was committed in this city. We are ,UNGD
RUS,2011,convinced that it is necessary to strengthen multilateral ,UNGD
RUS,2011,cooperation in countering international terrorism on ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"both the global and regional levels. However, the ",UNGD
RUS,2011,additional mechanisms to be created in this area should ,UNGD
RUS,2011,be incorporated in our common work within the United ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"Nations, with due account taken of its central ",UNGD
RUS,2011,coordinating role in combating terrorism. ,UNGD
RUS,2011, Wide international cooperation is needed to keep ,UNGD
RUS,2011,the situation in the global economic and financial ,UNGD
RUS,2011,system under control. One can hardly deny the ,UNGD
RUS,2011,importance of the role that the Group of Twenty (G-20) ,UNGD
RUS,2011,plays in the post-crisis recovery of the world economy. ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"Today, it is important to finalize the process of ",UNGD
RUS,2011,reforming the global financial and economic ,UNGD
RUS,2011,architecture and to implement everything we have ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"agreed on, rather than to stop halfway. The efficiency ",UNGD
RUS,2011,of these efforts will only grow if the G-20 strengthens ,UNGD
RUS,2011,its dialogue with the United Nations and its specialized ,UNGD
RUS,2011,agencies.  ,UNGD
RUS,2011, A significant contribution to the reform of the ,UNGD
RUS,2011,global economy and finance is being made by ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"BRICS — Brazil, Russia, India, China and South ",UNGD
RUS,2011,"Africa — a global-scale association of five major, ",UNGD
RUS,2011,rapidly growing economies that reflects the realities of ,UNGD
RUS,2011,the evolving multipolar world. BRICS does not aim at ,UNGD
RUS,2011,confrontation with anyone. Its goal is to enhance ,UNGD
RUS,2011,productive multilateral collaboration to address the ,UNGD
RUS,2011,urgent problems of the contemporary world. ,UNGD
RUS,2011, Sustainable development requires a reliable ,UNGD
RUS,2011,supply of energy resources for the global economy. ,UNGD
RUS,2011,Russia has proposed drafting a convention on ,UNGD
RUS,2011,international energy security that would cover all ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"aspects of global energy cooperation, taking into ",UNGD
RUS,2011,account the balance of interests of all actors in the ,UNGD
RUS,2011,international market. We call for the start of the ,UNGD
RUS,2011,practical preparation of this document. ,UNGD
RUS,2011," As in economics, the logic of joint consolidated ",UNGD
RUS,2011,actions should prevail in matters of security and the ,UNGD
RUS,2011,elimination of surplus weapons worldwide. Russia and ,UNGD
RUS,2011,the United States made another important step towards ,UNGD
RUS,2011,nuclear disarmament when they signed the Treaty on ,UNGD
RUS,2011,Strategic Offensive Arms and began its ,UNGD
RUS,2011,implementation. Its practical realization will allow us ,UNGD
RUS,2011,to make sure that the Treaty is effective and viable and ,UNGD
RUS,2011,  ,UNGD
RUS,2011, ,UNGD
RUS,2011,11-51670 16 ,UNGD
RUS,2011, ,UNGD
RUS,2011,to see how its fundamental principles are implemented. ,UNGD
RUS,2011,We call on all States with nuclear weapons capability ,UNGD
RUS,2011,to join the Russian-American efforts. We believe that ,UNGD
RUS,2011,further progress in nuclear arms reductions is possible ,UNGD
RUS,2011,only on a multilateral basis. ,UNGD
RUS,2011," Moreover, progress in this area is inseparable ",UNGD
RUS,2011,from coordinated efforts to move forward on all ,UNGD
RUS,2011,aspects of strengthening international security and ,UNGD
RUS,2011,strategic stability. This includes development of ,UNGD
RUS,2011,universally acceptable approaches to missile defence ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"issues, an accounting on the impact of strategic ",UNGD
RUS,2011,"conventional arms, prevention of the weaponization of ",UNGD
RUS,2011,space and elimination of qualitative and quantitative ,UNGD
RUS,2011,imbalances in conventional arms. ,UNGD
RUS,2011, The deployment of strategic missile defence ,UNGD
RUS,2011,elements in various parts of the world alters the overall ,UNGD
RUS,2011,configuration of international security. It is not enough ,UNGD
RUS,2011,to make statements that the increase in global missile ,UNGD
RUS,2011,defence capabilities would not undermine the basics of ,UNGD
RUS,2011,strategic stability. The issue is far too serious. We need ,UNGD
RUS,2011,solid legal guarantees that missile defence potential ,UNGD
RUS,2011,will actually be adequate to the declared objectives and ,UNGD
RUS,2011,will not disrupt global and regional balances. This ,UNGD
RUS,2011,holds equally true for both Europe and the Asia-Pacific ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"region, where the missile defence factor is beginning to ",UNGD
RUS,2011,affect the strategic environment. ,UNGD
RUS,2011, It is of primary importance for us to prevent the ,UNGD
RUS,2011,undermining of the non-proliferation regime. We call ,UNGD
RUS,2011,for universalization of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"of Nuclear Weapons, strengthening of the International ",UNGD
RUS,2011,Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards system and ,UNGD
RUS,2011,the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-,UNGD
RUS,2011,Test-Ban Treaty. Russia has been one of the main ,UNGD
RUS,2011,initiators of the proposal to convene in 2012 a ,UNGD
RUS,2011,conference on establishing a zone free of weapons of ,UNGD
RUS,2011,mass destruction and their means of delivery in the ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"Middle East and is now working intensively, together ",UNGD
RUS,2011,"with its partners, on the preparations for this important ",UNGD
RUS,2011,forum. ,UNGD
RUS,2011, The early resolution of the nuclear problems of ,UNGD
RUS,2011,Iran and the Korean Peninsula would contribute to the ,UNGD
RUS,2011,strengthening of the non-proliferation regime. We see ,UNGD
RUS,2011,no alternative to their political and diplomatic ,UNGD
RUS,2011,settlement and to taking concrete steps to create the ,UNGD
RUS,2011,conditions for the resumption of negotiations. We call ,UNGD
RUS,2011,on all partners to address these tasks with utmost ,UNGD
RUS,2011,responsibility. ,UNGD
RUS,2011, The situation around Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi-1 ,UNGD
RUS,2011,nuclear power plant has highlighted the need to ,UNGD
RUS,2011,improve the international legal framework in order to ,UNGD
RUS,2011,ensure the safety of nuclear power facilities. The ,UNGD
RUS,2011,Russian Federation has made proposals to enhance the ,UNGD
RUS,2011,mechanisms of the Convention on Nuclear Safety and ,UNGD
RUS,2011,the Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear ,UNGD
RUS,2011,Accident and to strengthen the relevant IAEA norms. ,UNGD
RUS,2011,We urge support for these initiatives. ,UNGD
RUS,2011, In the age of new telecommunications ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"technologies, international information security has ",UNGD
RUS,2011,become a challenge that requires coordinated efforts by ,UNGD
RUS,2011,the international community. Reliable protection of the ,UNGD
RUS,2011,field of information from malicious and criminal ,UNGD
RUS,2011,attacks is the goal of the initiative that Russia and its ,UNGD
RUS,2011,partners are promoting at the United Nations. During ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"this session, we will put forward proposals on ",UNGD
RUS,2011,developing specific rules of conduct in this area. ,UNGD
RUS,2011," In a polycentric world, an effective international ",UNGD
RUS,2011,architecture can be created only if it rests on regional ,UNGD
RUS,2011,building blocks. The enhancing of global governance at ,UNGD
RUS,2011,the regional level and the increasing role of regional ,UNGD
RUS,2011,organizations are an integral part of modern ,UNGD
RUS,2011,international relations. Integration associations and ,UNGD
RUS,2011,organizations in the Commonwealth of Independent ,UNGD
RUS,2011,States area contribute to these processes. The Eurasian ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"Economic Community, with its $10 billion anti-crisis ",UNGD
RUS,2011,"fund, operates in the financial and economic sphere. A ",UNGD
RUS,2011,"customs union between Russia, Kazakhstan and ",UNGD
RUS,2011,"Belarus has been created, and single economic space is ",UNGD
RUS,2011,taking shape with a view to establishing a Eurasian ,UNGD
RUS,2011,union. ,UNGD
RUS,2011, The Collective Security Treaty Organization ,UNGD
RUS,2011,(CSTO) is a key tool for ensuring stability within the ,UNGD
RUS,2011,area of its responsibility. The signing of the joint ,UNGD
RUS,2011,declaration on cooperation between the United Nations ,UNGD
RUS,2011,Secretariat and the CSTO secretariat in March 2011 ,UNGD
RUS,2011,was a major step in the collaboration between these ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"two organizations, primarily in the field of ",UNGD
RUS,2011,peacekeeping. We are ready to start working on its ,UNGD
RUS,2011,practical modalities. Russia consistently calls for ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"interaction between regional organizations, under the ",UNGD
RUS,2011,"auspices of the United Nations, to strengthen global ",UNGD
RUS,2011,stability on the basis of the solid legal framework of ,UNGD
RUS,2011,the Charter. ,UNGD
RUS,2011, Priority should be given to equal and indivisible ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"security, predictability, transparency and mutual ",UNGD
RUS,2011,"respect, taking into account one other’s interests. This ",UNGD
RUS,2011, ,UNGD
RUS,2011, ,UNGD
RUS,2011,17 11-51670 ,UNGD
RUS,2011, ,UNGD
RUS,2011,is exactly the aim of Russian President Medvedev’s ,UNGD
RUS,2011,initiative to sign a treaty on European security. Its ,UNGD
RUS,2011,practical implementation would allow us to finally put ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"a period to the post-cold war era, to establish a ",UNGD
RUS,2011,universal and clear framework for a reliable solution to ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"such issues as missile defence and arms control, and to ",UNGD
RUS,2011,create a common space of security and development ,UNGD
RUS,2011,without dividing lines. ,UNGD
RUS,2011, Achieving equal and indivisible security is an ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"urgent issue for the Asia-Pacific region, with the ",UNGD
RUS,2011,Russian Far East and Eastern Siberia as integral parts. ,UNGD
RUS,2011,The joint initiative launched by the leaders of China ,UNGD
RUS,2011,and Russia in September 2010 is aimed at creating a ,UNGD
RUS,2011,comprehensive architecture for security and ,UNGD
RUS,2011,cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region on a bloc-free ,UNGD
RUS,2011,legal basis. We could move closer to this goal by ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"promoting a network of multilateral diplomacy, an idea ",UNGD
RUS,2011,that has been supported by the members of the ,UNGD
RUS,2011,Shanghai Cooperation Organization. ,UNGD
RUS,2011, Progress in the settlement of regional conflicts ,UNGD
RUS,2011,would contribute to a more stable international ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"environment. Today, special attention is given to the ",UNGD
RUS,2011,developments in the Arab world.  ,UNGD
RUS,2011, Russia condemns the use of violence against ,UNGD
RUS,2011,civilians and supports the aspirations of Arab peoples ,UNGD
RUS,2011,for the revival of their States and their democratic ,UNGD
RUS,2011,development and social and economic prosperity. At ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"the same time, actions by the outside forces must be ",UNGD
RUS,2011,based on full respect for international law and be ,UNGD
RUS,2011,instrumental to the search for a political settlement ,UNGD
RUS,2011,between the authorities and the opposition. The ,UNGD
RUS,2011,attempts to go beyond the Security Council mandate ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"are unacceptable, since they undermine its authority ",UNGD
RUS,2011,and compound the suffering of innocent civilians. ,UNGD
RUS,2011," In this context, it seems quite pertinent that States ",UNGD
RUS,2011,and regional organizations commit themselves to ,UNGD
RUS,2011,strictly complying with the existing norms of ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"international law, including humanitarian law, in order ",UNGD
RUS,2011,"to protect civilians during armed conflict. This step, ",UNGD
RUS,2011,which further enhances the existing legal basis of ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"international relations, would contribute to the ",UNGD
RUS,2011,strengthening of regional and global security in its ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"modern, multidimensional interpretation. ",UNGD
RUS,2011, The leading role in elaborating modalities for ,UNGD
RUS,2011,post-conflict resolution in Libya must be played by the ,UNGD
RUS,2011,United Nations and in particular the Security Council. ,UNGD
RUS,2011,That is precisely the goal of Security Council ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"resolution 2009 (2011) of 16 September 2011, which ",UNGD
RUS,2011,established the United Nations Support Mission in ,UNGD
RUS,2011,Libya. We believe that it is time to take additional ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"steps, including the lifting of the no-fly zone. ",UNGD
RUS,2011," As for Syria, it is inadmissible to boycott ",UNGD
RUS,2011,"proposals for a national dialogue, stir up confrontation ",UNGD
RUS,2011,"and provoke violence, while neglecting the reforms — ",UNGD
RUS,2011,"late in coming, but still achievable — proposed by ",UNGD
RUS,2011,President Al-Assad. It is important to encourage the ,UNGD
RUS,2011,authorities and the opposition to start negotiations and ,UNGD
RUS,2011,agree on the future of their country. We hope that the ,UNGD
RUS,2011,League of Arab States will make the necessary efforts. ,UNGD
RUS,2011, The situation in the Middle East could be ,UNGD
RUS,2011,significantly improved by progress in the negotiation ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"process, on the basis of the main parameters defined ",UNGD
RUS,2011,"and recorded in Security Council resolutions, the ",UNGD
RUS,2011,Madrid terms of reference and the Arab Peace ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"Initiative, and reiterated in the Quartet ministerial ",UNGD
RUS,2011,statement of 23 September. The only viable basis for a ,UNGD
RUS,2011,settlement is the coexistence of Palestinian and Israeli ,UNGD
RUS,2011,States in peace and security. We support the ,UNGD
RUS,2011,Palestinians’ application to the Security Council and ,UNGD
RUS,2011,welcome the readiness reiterated by the President of ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"the Palestinian National Authority, Mr. Abbas, to hold ",UNGD
RUS,2011,talks with Israel on the basis of the existing ,UNGD
RUS,2011,international legal framework. ,UNGD
RUS,2011, We encourage the Cypriot communities to ,UNGD
RUS,2011,continue negotiations under United Nations auspices to ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"achieve a comprehensive, just and viable settlement on ",UNGD
RUS,2011,the basis of the relevant Security Council resolutions. ,UNGD
RUS,2011, We call upon all parties to the Nagorno-Karabakh ,UNGD
RUS,2011,settlement process to take advantage of the additional ,UNGD
RUS,2011,opportunities arising from the efforts made in the ,UNGD
RUS,2011,context of Russia’s mediation. We will promote ,UNGD
RUS,2011,confidence-building and ceasefire enforcement ,UNGD
RUS,2011,measures within the framework of the Troika of the ,UNGD
RUS,2011,co-Chairs of the Organization for Security and ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"Cooperation in Europe Minsk Group, together with ",UNGD
RUS,2011,American and French partners. ,UNGD
RUS,2011, We hope that the decision taken in Moscow on ,UNGD
RUS,2011,22 September on resuming official talks on a ,UNGD
RUS,2011,Transdniestrian settlement will encourage the parties to ,UNGD
RUS,2011,seek ways to arrive at mutually acceptable agreements. ,UNGD
RUS,2011, We are strongly committed to doing our utmost to ,UNGD
RUS,2011,prevent a repetition of a scenario involving the use of ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"force in the Caucasus, as happened in August 2008 as a ",UNGD
RUS,2011,result of a reckless venture by the ruling regime in ,UNGD
RUS,2011,Tbilisi. Russia is ready to act as a guarantor of ,UNGD
RUS,2011,  ,UNGD
RUS,2011, ,UNGD
RUS,2011,11-51670 18 ,UNGD
RUS,2011, ,UNGD
RUS,2011,arrangements on the non-use of force between ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"Abkhazia, Georgia, and South Ossetia, taking into ",UNGD
RUS,2011,account the earlier relevant statements made by the ,UNGD
RUS,2011,leaders of these three parties. We would welcome it if ,UNGD
RUS,2011,the United States and the European Union made similar ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"commitments. As guarantors, we would be ready to ",UNGD
RUS,2011,take steps to prevent the resumption of violence in the ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"region and, in the case of the wrongful use of force by ",UNGD
RUS,2011,"either side, to work towards an early resolution of the ",UNGD
RUS,2011,situation on the basis of the existing norms of ,UNGD
RUS,2011,international law. ,UNGD
RUS,2011, Russia is providing significant support for the ,UNGD
RUS,2011,efforts to stabilize the situation in Afghanistan. At the ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"same time, we call on the International Security ",UNGD
RUS,2011,Assistance Force to more effectively fight the growing ,UNGD
RUS,2011,Afghan drug threat. Central Asia and Russia are ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"already facing a “heroin aggression”, while the profits ",UNGD
RUS,2011,from drug trafficking are being used as the main source ,UNGD
RUS,2011,of financing the clandestine extremist underground in ,UNGD
RUS,2011,the region. The fight against this evil should be ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"uncompromising, and it should target the entire drug ",UNGD
RUS,2011,business chain. ,UNGD
RUS,2011, The problems on the African continent should be ,UNGD
RUS,2011,a focus of continuous attention on the part of the ,UNGD
RUS,2011,United Nations. Such attention should include ,UNGD
RUS,2011,development assistance as well as efforts to overcome ,UNGD
RUS,2011,the current humanitarian crisis in the Horn of Africa ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"and resolve the numerous ongoing conflicts, while ",UNGD
RUS,2011,maintaining the leading role of the African Union. ,UNGD
RUS,2011, The eradication of piracy remains a priority. It is ,UNGD
RUS,2011,necessary to accelerate the establishment of an ,UNGD
RUS,2011,international anti-piracy court mechanism in the ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"region, in accordance with the Security Council ",UNGD
RUS,2011,resolution adopted on the initiative of Russia. ,UNGD
RUS,2011, Experience has shown that pressure and unilateral ,UNGD
RUS,2011,sanctions cannot be a cure-all in addressing various ,UNGD
RUS,2011,conflict situations; they only complicate efforts to ,UNGD
RUS,2011,resolve them. We urge that an end be put to any actions ,UNGD
RUS,2011,that circumvent the Security Council. We also call for ,UNGD
RUS,2011,the lifting of the blockade of Cuba. Cooperation rather ,UNGD
RUS,2011,than isolation should be the method for settling ,UNGD
RUS,2011,conflicts in the twenty-first century. ,UNGD
RUS,2011, The ongoing transformation in contemporary ,UNGD
RUS,2011,international relations makes it a priority task on the ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"global agenda to expand intercultural, interreligious ",UNGD
RUS,2011,and inter-civilization dialogue in order to devise ,UNGD
RUS,2011,approaches to the problems of the modern world that ,UNGD
RUS,2011,are based on shared values. The degradation of ,UNGD
RUS,2011,fundamental moral values leads to the degradation of ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"society. The recent tragic events in Norway, riots in ",UNGD
RUS,2011,"Great Britain, protests by young people in other ",UNGD
RUS,2011,"countries, and calls to suppress Christian minorities in ",UNGD
RUS,2011,the Middle East and North Africa — all of those events ,UNGD
RUS,2011,are the result of a deterioration in moral and ethical ,UNGD
RUS,2011,values. There can be no freedom without responsibility ,UNGD
RUS,2011,and no democracy without self-restraint. There is a ,UNGD
RUS,2011,clear and urgent need to counter the threats posed by ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"nationalism, ethnic and religious intolerance. We ",UNGD
RUS,2011,therefore reiterate the importance of the recent High-,UNGD
RUS,2011,level Meeting of the General Assembly to ,UNGD
RUS,2011,commemorate the tenth anniversary of the adoption of ,UNGD
RUS,2011,the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and ",UNGD
RUS,2011,related intolerance. ,UNGD
RUS,2011, Attempts to falsify or revise history are ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"inadmissible, all the more so given that we are marking ",UNGD
RUS,2011,the sixty-fifth anniversary of the Nuremberg Tribunal ,UNGD
RUS,2011,verdict. Political correctness and talk of freedom of ,UNGD
RUS,2011,"speech cannot serve as a cover when, in certain ",UNGD
RUS,2011,"European countries, people who brought disgrace upon ",UNGD
RUS,2011,themselves by cooperating with the Nazis are being ,UNGD
RUS,2011,talked and written about in an increasingly elevated ,UNGD
RUS,2011,tone. Russia will never forget the countless military ,UNGD
RUS,2011,crimes committed by Hitler and his associates in our ,UNGD
RUS,2011,land and throughout Europe during the years of the ,UNGD
RUS,2011,Nazi aggression. ,UNGD
RUS,2011, The rapid changes taking place in the world make ,UNGD
RUS,2011,it imperative to strengthen the role of the United ,UNGD
RUS,2011,Nations and to adapt it to contemporary realities while ,UNGD
RUS,2011,preserving — naturally — its inter-State character and ,UNGD
RUS,2011,the immutability of its Charter principles. A ,UNGD
RUS,2011,fundamental element of the Organization’s renewal is ,UNGD
RUS,2011,the reform of the Security Council. We support a ,UNGD
RUS,2011,solution that is based upon the broadest possible ,UNGD
RUS,2011,agreement. ,UNGD
RUS,2011," The world community faces many challenges, ",UNGD
RUS,2011,"and the United Nations, as a major mechanism for ",UNGD
RUS,2011,"global regulation, is today in demand as never before. ",UNGD
RUS,2011,Together we will find practical ways to effectively ,UNGD
RUS,2011,overcome the threats of the twenty-first century.,UNGD
RUS,2012,"For over a year and a half, the situation in the",UNGD
RUS,2012,Middle East and North Africa has been the nerve centre,UNGD
RUS,2012,of global politics. The deep changes that have swept,UNGD
RUS,2012,over the region intertwine with the key problems of,UNGD
RUS,2012,modern international relations and require everyone to,UNGD
RUS,2012,take a comprehensive approach and to reject simplistic,UNGD
RUS,2012,and ideology-driven patterns and double standards.,UNGD
RUS,2012,Russia has consistently supported peoples in their,UNGD
RUS,2012,aspiration to determine their destiny and to pave the,UNGD
RUS,2012,way to more effective models of public governance.,UNGD
RUS,2012,We believe it is particularly important to carry out,UNGD
RUS,2012,those transformations in a non-violent way and without,UNGD
RUS,2012,outside interference. We strongly believe that all,UNGD
RUS,2012,members of the international community should be,UNGD
RUS,2012,interested in making the Middle East-North Africa,UNGD
RUS,2012,"region peaceful, stable, democratic and free from",UNGD
RUS,2012,"domestic and inter-State conflicts. So far, however,",UNGD
RUS,2012,there has been no progress in reaching unanimity in,UNGD
RUS,2012,the efforts of outside players to create conditions for,UNGD
RUS,2012,achieving that goal.,UNGD
RUS,2012,Of particular concern is the deepening internal,UNGD
RUS,2012,conflict in Syria. We have consistently called for,UNGD
RUS,2012,consolidated efforts by the international community,UNGD
RUS,2012,to compel the Government and its opponents to,UNGD
RUS,2012,"immediately cease the violence, come to the negotiating",UNGD
RUS,2012,table and work out a compromise on the content and,UNGD
RUS,2012,pace of reforms that would satisfy all Syrians and,UNGD
RUS,2012,ensure the safety and rights of all ethnic and religious,UNGD
RUS,2012,groups. That was the substance of the consensus,UNGD
RUS,2012,recorded in the final communiqué of the Action Group,UNGD
RUS,2012,"for Syria (S/2012/523, annex), agreed upon in Geneva",UNGD
RUS,2012,as a follow-up to the Kofi Annan plan.,UNGD
RUS,2012,We call upon all members of the Action Group,UNGD
RUS,2012,to fully abide by the commitments we all took on in,UNGD
RUS,2012,Geneva. That is the fastest way to stop the loss of human,UNGD
RUS,2012,life in Syria. We proposed a Security Council resolution,UNGD
RUS,2012,endorsing the Geneva communiqué as the basis for,UNGD
RUS,2012,"negotiations at the beginning of the transitional period, but that proposal was blocked. Those who oppose the",UNGD
RUS,2012,implementation of the Geneva communiqué bear an,UNGD
RUS,2012,onerous responsibility. They insist on a ceasefire by,UNGD
RUS,2012,the Government alone and encourage the opposition,UNGD
RUS,2012,"to intensify hostilities, in fact pushing Syria even",UNGD
RUS,2012,deeper into the abyss of bloody internecine strife. The,UNGD
RUS,2012,"militarization of the conflict continues, with calls for",UNGD
RUS,2012,open intervention.,UNGD
RUS,2012,Extremist organizations including Al-Qaida,UNGD
RUS,2012,have become more active in Syria. They perpetrate,UNGD
RUS,2012,terrorist attacks against innocent civilians and civil,UNGD
RUS,2012,"infrastructure. The number of war crimes is growing, on",UNGD
RUS,2012,"the part of both Government forces and the opposition,",UNGD
RUS,2012,as recorded in the recent report of the Human Rights,UNGD
RUS,2012,Council’s commission of inquiry (A/HRC/21/50).,UNGD
RUS,2012,"Russia resolutely condemns any violence, wherever",UNGD
RUS,2012,"it comes from, and is convinced that there is still an",UNGD
RUS,2012,opportunity to undertake collective action. Practical,UNGD
RUS,2012,steps to overcome the crisis need to begin with a,UNGD
RUS,2012,"comprehensive ceasefire, the release of prisoners and",UNGD
RUS,2012,hostages and the provision of additional humanitarian,UNGD
RUS,2012,aid. That would create the conditions to start an,UNGD
RUS,2012,"inter-Syrian dialogue. We hope that Lakhdar Brahimi,",UNGD
RUS,2012,Joint Special Representative of the United Nations and,UNGD
RUS,2012,"the League of Arab States, will be able to bring his vast",UNGD
RUS,2012,experience to bear on moving towards an agreement on,UNGD
RUS,2012,"such arrangements, with the support of the international",UNGD
RUS,2012,community. Russia will provide its full support to,UNGD
RUS,2012,promote the success of his mission.,UNGD
RUS,2012,The changes taking place in the Middle East,UNGD
RUS,2012,should not marginalize the Palestinian problem. The,UNGD
RUS,2012,"achievement of a comprehensive, just and lasting Arab-",UNGD
RUS,2012,"Israeli settlement, which should lead, among other",UNGD
RUS,2012,"results, to the establishment of an independent, viable",UNGD
RUS,2012,"and contiguous Palestinian State, coexisting in peace",UNGD
RUS,2012,"and security with Israel, would be a major contribution",UNGD
RUS,2012,to the normalization of the overall regional situation.,UNGD
RUS,2012,"The Arab Peace Initiative fully retains its relevance,",UNGD
RUS,2012,and we support the efforts of the League of Arab States,UNGD
RUS,2012,to move it forward.,UNGD
RUS,2012,I also wish to stress the importance of implementing,UNGD
RUS,2012,the decision on convening in 2012 a conference on,UNGD
RUS,2012,establishing in the Middle East a zone free of weapons,UNGD
RUS,2012,of mass destruction and their means of delivery (see,UNGD
RUS,2012,NPT/CONF/2010/50 (Vol.I)). It is clearly necessary to,UNGD
RUS,2012,ensure the participation in the conference of all States in,UNGD
RUS,2012,"the region, and they should agree on key arrangements among themselves. In that matter, the League of Arab",UNGD
RUS,2012,States should play an important role.,UNGD
RUS,2012,"On the whole, we support closer ties between the",UNGD
RUS,2012,United Nations and regional entities. I would note,UNGD
RUS,2012,that in our part of the world today a memorandum on,UNGD
RUS,2012,cooperation was signed between the secretariat of the,UNGD
RUS,2012,Collective Security Treaty Organization and the United,UNGD
RUS,2012,Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations. I am,UNGD
RUS,2012,convinced that it will increase the efficiency of common,UNGD
RUS,2012,efforts to ensure stability and security.,UNGD
RUS,2012,All our actions should be founded solidly on the,UNGD
RUS,2012,"United Nations Charter, which makes no provision",UNGD
RUS,2012,for the right to change regimes. It is unacceptable to,UNGD
RUS,2012,impose a political system on a country and its people.,UNGD
RUS,2012,Our position was clearly stated by President Vladimir,UNGD
RUS,2012,Putin speaking at the Kremlin on 26 September. The,UNGD
RUS,2012,entire sequence of events in the Arab world and other,UNGD
RUS,2012,"regions proves the futility of any such policy, which can",UNGD
RUS,2012,lead to dangerous interethnic and interreligious clashes,UNGD
RUS,2012,in international relations.,UNGD
RUS,2012,We believe it is an obligation of all States to protect,UNGD
RUS,2012,from provocations and blasphemy the religious feelings,UNGD
RUS,2012,of people of any religious affiliation. At the same,UNGD
RUS,2012,"time, of course, there can be no justification for acts",UNGD
RUS,2012,"of terror, regardless of where they are committed, be",UNGD
RUS,2012,"they in Libya, Syria, Iraq, Yemen or anywhere else.",UNGD
RUS,2012,Attacks against diplomats or United Nations personnel,UNGD
RUS,2012,are absolutely unacceptable.,UNGD
RUS,2012,"In general, we are convinced that today, when the",UNGD
RUS,2012,world is going through a transition period characterized,UNGD
RUS,2012,"by instability in the spheres of the economy, politics and",UNGD
RUS,2012,"inter-civilizational relations, it is particularly important",UNGD
RUS,2012,for United Nations Member States to be able to rely,UNGD
RUS,2012,on accepted rules of conduct and to agree on a joint,UNGD
RUS,2012,response to the threats to global stability. We should,UNGD
RUS,2012,not allow irresponsible actions dictated by expedient,UNGD
RUS,2012,interests to shatter the system of international law. The,UNGD
RUS,2012,world order is threatened by arbitrary interpretation,UNGD
RUS,2012,of such essential principles as the non-use or threat of,UNGD
RUS,2012,"force, the peaceful settlement of disputes, respect for",UNGD
RUS,2012,the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States and,UNGD
RUS,2012,non-interference in their domestic affairs.,UNGD
RUS,2012,Those are the key principles of the United Nations,UNGD
RUS,2012,"Charter, which confers the primary responsibility for",UNGD
RUS,2012,the maintenance of international peace and security on,UNGD
RUS,2012,the Security Council. In advancing the reform of the,UNGD
RUS,2012,"United Nations, it is essential to preserve the capacity of",UNGD
RUS,2012,the Security Council to perform those functions. Their erosion would deprive the international community of,UNGD
RUS,2012,an essential mechanism for developing joint approaches,UNGD
RUS,2012,to the settlement of crisis situations.,UNGD
RUS,2012,It is appropriate to mention the compulsory,UNGD
RUS,2012,instruments at the disposal of the United Nations. Under,UNGD
RUS,2012,the United Nations Charter the imposition of sanctions,UNGD
RUS,2012,falls exclusively under the jurisdiction of the Security,UNGD
RUS,2012,"Council. Decisions must be made on a collegial basis,",UNGD
RUS,2012,with the understanding that sanctions should not lead,UNGD
RUS,2012,"to isolation of the State targeted for sanctions, but",UNGD
RUS,2012,rather encourage it to engage in a dialogue to remove,UNGD
RUS,2012,questions that the Member States may have. It is,UNGD
RUS,2012,essential that sanctions should be well-measured and,UNGD
RUS,2012,that they not cause any suffering to the population. In,UNGD
RUS,2012,the past the Security Council has discussed the issue of,UNGD
RUS,2012,"the humanitarian limits of sanctions, but somehow the",UNGD
RUS,2012,discussions have faded away. We believe it is important,UNGD
RUS,2012,to resume them.,UNGD
RUS,2012,Another issue that needs to be discussed in the,UNGD
RUS,2012,Security Council is the consequences of unilateral,UNGD
RUS,2012,sanctions imposed by a State or a group of States,UNGD
RUS,2012,sidestepping the United Nations to advance their,UNGD
RUS,2012,"political goals. We have no doubt that such sanctions,",UNGD
RUS,2012,"especially when they are applied extraterritorially,",UNGD
RUS,2012,weaken the unity of the international community,UNGD
RUS,2012,and undermine the effectiveness of its efforts. For,UNGD
RUS,2012,"many years, the commercial, economic and financial",UNGD
RUS,2012,restrictions imposed by the United States on Cuba,UNGD
RUS,2012,have remained an illustration of the negative impact,UNGD
RUS,2012,"of unilateral sanctions. Russia, together with the",UNGD
RUS,2012,overwhelming majority of members of the international,UNGD
RUS,2012,"community, calls for the swift lifting of the blockade,",UNGD
RUS,2012,which is a relic of the Cold War.,UNGD
RUS,2012,Special attention should be given to the practical,UNGD
RUS,2012,enforcement of Security Council decisions regarding,UNGD
RUS,2012,sanctions against non-State actors and illegal cross-,UNGD
RUS,2012,"border formations. In general, the events of recent",UNGD
RUS,2012,years have clearly shown that unilateral action which,UNGD
RUS,2012,violates international law and circumvents or distorts,UNGD
RUS,2012,the decisions of the Security Council does no good.,UNGD
RUS,2012,"Of course, the legal norms of international affairs",UNGD
RUS,2012,will be further adjusted as necessary. But these,UNGD
RUS,2012,transformations should be treated with the greatest,UNGD
RUS,2012,sense of responsibility and full consciousness of the,UNGD
RUS,2012,serious risks involved. Consensus should be the sole,UNGD
RUS,2012,route to their adoption. Violations of international,UNGD
RUS,2012,law should not be portrayed as some sort of creative,UNGD
RUS,2012,development.,UNGD
RUS,2012,,UNGD
RUS,2012,All of this is related to the debate regarding the,UNGD
RUS,2012,concept of the so-called responsibility to protect. Further,UNGD
RUS,2012,discussion of this concept should be held on the basis,UNGD
RUS,2012,"of the approach agreed on at the 2005 World Summit,",UNGD
RUS,2012,which reaffirmed the need to observe the principles of,UNGD
RUS,2012,the Charter of the United Nations when responding to,UNGD
RUS,2012,conflicts within States. The protection of civilians is an,UNGD
RUS,2012,issue far too serious to be exploited to achieve political,UNGD
RUS,2012,goals. The ambiguity of the so-called responsibility-,UNGD
RUS,2012,to-protect concept can be better understood in light of,UNGD
RUS,2012,initiatives formulated by Brazil and several other States,UNGD
RUS,2012,to move towards consensus.,UNGD
RUS,2012,Let us not forget that the founders of the United,UNGD
RUS,2012,"Nations, in their wisdom, agreed upon and endorsed",UNGD
RUS,2012,a Charter that enshrined principles for the regulation,UNGD
RUS,2012,of a multipolar world order. Now that the abnormal,UNGD
RUS,2012,"bipolar period of the Cold War is over, and now that",UNGD
RUS,2012,it has become clear to all that there is no place for,UNGD
RUS,2012,monopolarity in the modern world and international,UNGD
RUS,2012,"affairs can only be polycentric, we have a unique",UNGD
RUS,2012,chance to fully implement the original potential of that,UNGD
RUS,2012,Charter.,UNGD
RUS,2012,This is a difficult challenge. International relations,UNGD
RUS,2012,are clearly experiencing a lack of credibility. We regard,UNGD
RUS,2012,this as the main obstacle to practical progress towards,UNGD
RUS,2012,the establishment of universal foundations for equal,UNGD
RUS,2012,"and indivisible security, whether in the Euro-Atlantic",UNGD
RUS,2012,"area, Asia-Pacific region or other parts of the world.",UNGD
RUS,2012,Such a state of affairs clearly contradicts the concept,UNGD
RUS,2012,of collective security embodied in the Charter and the,UNGD
RUS,2012,"deep interdependence of the modern world, where most",UNGD
RUS,2012,challenges and threats are common to us all and have a,UNGD
RUS,2012,cross-border dimension.,UNGD
RUS,2012,Strengthening confidence and collective principles,UNGD
RUS,2012,"in international affairs, with the emphasis on",UNGD
RUS,2012,"negotiating the pursuit of compromise solutions, would",UNGD
RUS,2012,help substantially reduce the level of instability and,UNGD
RUS,2012,"move forward in the settlement of crisis situations, not",UNGD
RUS,2012,"only in the Middle East, but also with respect to Iran,",UNGD
RUS,2012,"Afghanistan, the Korean peninsula and other situations",UNGD
RUS,2012,throughout the world.,UNGD
RUS,2012,The final goal of the efforts to settle a conflict is,UNGD
RUS,2012,to ensure the right to life and other fundamental human,UNGD
RUS,2012,"rights, be they political, economic or social. The events",UNGD
RUS,2012,"of recent years confirm that, without lasting peace and",UNGD
RUS,2012,"sustainable development, it is impossible to ensure",UNGD
RUS,2012,"human rights. In turn, the protection of human rights",UNGD
RUS,2012,"should contribute to security and development, rather than serve as a pretext for illegal interference in the",UNGD
RUS,2012,domestic affairs of States.,UNGD
RUS,2012,The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states,UNGD
RUS,2012,that everyone is entitled to an international order in,UNGD
RUS,2012,which their rights can be fully realized. Those who use,UNGD
RUS,2012,"military force and sanctions, bypassing the Charter,",UNGD
RUS,2012,"engage in illicit supplies of arms, or provide cover for",UNGD
RUS,2012,terrorists grossly violate this right.,UNGD
RUS,2012,Russia stands for the implementation of the,UNGD
RUS,2012,Universal Declaration of Human Rights and respect for,UNGD
RUS,2012,the traditional values on which human civilization is,UNGD
RUS,2012,based and where all world religions converge. This is,UNGD
RUS,2012,a moral foundation of modern society. It is the cement,UNGD
RUS,2012,that bonds together nations and peoples. In recent,UNGD
RUS,2012,"years, these values have been put to the test by displays",UNGD
RUS,2012,"of immorality, extremism and racial intolerance. Of",UNGD
RUS,2012,similar concern are the even more assertive actions,UNGD
RUS,2012,"of those who, citing freedom of speech, condone the",UNGD
RUS,2012,glorification of the Nazis and their accomplices and,UNGD
RUS,2012,desecrate the memory of the victims of the Second,UNGD
RUS,2012,World War and the victors of fascism. Such actions are,UNGD
RUS,2012,incompatible with the obligations of States under the,UNGD
RUS,2012,Charter of the United Nations.,UNGD
RUS,2012,Let me recall that the International Covenant,UNGD
RUS,2012,on Civil and Political Rights directly prohibits the,UNGD
RUS,2012,propaganda of war and incitement of national and,UNGD
RUS,2012,religious discord. This means that freedom of speech,UNGD
RUS,2012,and assembly cannot be used to justify the promotion,UNGD
RUS,2012,"of Nazi or other radical or extremist views, in violation",UNGD
RUS,2012,of the basic principles and norms of international law.,UNGD
RUS,2012,"Yesterday, the Human Rights Council endorsed a",UNGD
RUS,2012,resolution proposed by Russia on the interrelation of,UNGD
RUS,2012,human rights and traditional values. It is regrettable,UNGD
RUS,2012,that a number of Western States voted against this,UNGD
RUS,2012,"document, which is especially relevant today.",UNGD
RUS,2012,Progress towards genuine partnership in,UNGD
RUS,2012,international relations is possible only on the basis,UNGD
RUS,2012,of equality and mutual respect. The course of events,UNGD
RUS,2012,in the world leaves no alternative for anyone but to,UNGD
RUS,2012,"join efforts in order to build a stable, equitable and",UNGD
RUS,2012,democratic international system. It would be possible,UNGD
RUS,2012,to resist this objective trend and try to preserve the old,UNGD
RUS,2012,"order for some time, but such resistance would cost yet",UNGD
RUS,2012,"more lives, suffering and destruction. Let us display",UNGD
RUS,2012,"our vision and, instead of looking back at the history of",UNGD
RUS,2012,"previous centuries, take the side of the events unfolding",UNGD
RUS,2012,"before us today, and answer the call for strong collective",UNGD
RUS,2012,statesmanship.,UNGD
RUS,2013,International relations are becoming increasingly ,UNGD
RUS,2013,"complex and multidimensional, while developments ",UNGD
RUS,2013,in the world are even more rapid and less predictable. ,UNGD
RUS,2013,"Under these circumstances as never before, there is an ",UNGD
RUS,2013,urgent need to agree upon collective responses to the ,UNGD
RUS,2013,key issues of today. It is solely within the power of such ,UNGD
RUS,2013,a truly universal Organization as the United Nations ,UNGD
RUS,2013,"to do so. Moreover, such solidarity-based efforts will ",UNGD
RUS,2013,be productive only if they reflect the entire spectrum ,UNGD
RUS,2013,of views of the international community on global ,UNGD
RUS,2013,"challenges and threats, a broad range of historical ",UNGD
RUS,2013,experiences and the full cultural and civilizational ,UNGD
RUS,2013,diversity of the modern world.,UNGD
RUS,2013,,UNGD
RUS,2013,For most of the Members of the United Nations ,UNGD
RUS,2013,"family, that approach is axiomatic. However, there is ",UNGD
RUS,2013,also another tendency whereby collective actions are ,UNGD
RUS,2013,understood primarily as agreement with the viewpoint ,UNGD
RUS,2013,of one group of countries. Such views manifest ,UNGD
RUS,2013,"themselves in various areas: international security, the ",UNGD
RUS,2013,"settlement of conflict situations, the functioning of the ",UNGD
RUS,2013,"world economy, and the choice of development models ",UNGD
RUS,2013,and core values.,UNGD
RUS,2013,,UNGD
RUS,2013,Many problems affecting today’s world are reflected ,UNGD
RUS,2013,in the tragic situation in Syria and in the uncertainty ,UNGD
RUS,2013,surrounding the development of events in the Middle ,UNGD
RUS,2013,East and North Africa overall. From the very onset of ,UNGD
RUS,2013,"the turmoil in that region, Russia has consistently called ",UNGD
RUS,2013,for the development by the international community ,UNGD
RUS,2013,of a common approach combining support for the ,UNGD
RUS,2013,Arab peoples on their path to transformation with ,UNGD
RUS,2013,"an understanding of the fact that, objectively, those ",UNGD
RUS,2013,"processes will be lengthy and sometimes painful, and ",UNGD
RUS,2013,that it will be quite important not to undermine them ,UNGD
RUS,2013,through gross outside interference.,UNGD
RUS,2013,,UNGD
RUS,2013,We have emphasized the need to act in a balanced ,UNGD
RUS,2013,way and to take account of the fact that current complex ,UNGD
RUS,2013,"developments are associated with, among other things, ",UNGD
RUS,2013,a tireless quest for compromises among the various ,UNGD
RUS,2013,ethnic and religious groups that make up the mosaic ,UNGD
RUS,2013,of Arab societies. We have consistently supported the ,UNGD
RUS,2013,choice of the evolutionary way of development and the ,UNGD
RUS,2013,peaceful settlement of crises through national dialogue ,UNGD
RUS,2013,and reconciliation.,UNGD
RUS,2013,,UNGD
RUS,2013,Another perspective has been reflected in the ,UNGD
RUS,2013,attempts made to determine who is and is not legitimate ,UNGD
RUS,2013,among the leaders of the Middle East and North Africa ,UNGD
RUS,2013,"region, to impose a view as to which side should be ",UNGD
RUS,2013,"supported in domestic national conflicts, and to dictate ",UNGD
RUS,2013,"external, ready-made prescriptions for democratic ",UNGD
RUS,2013,transformation.,UNGD
RUS,2013,,UNGD
RUS,2013,"Attempts to portray, in a simplified way, the ",UNGD
RUS,2013,developments in the Arab world as the struggle of ,UNGD
RUS,2013,democracy against tyranny or of good against evil ,UNGD
RUS,2013,have long obscured the problems associated with the ,UNGD
RUS,2013,"rising wave of extremism, which is spilling over into ",UNGD
RUS,2013,other regions today. The terrorist attacks in Kenya ,UNGD
RUS,2013,have demonstrated the full gravity of that threat. It is ,UNGD
RUS,2013,common knowledge that jihadist groups that include ,UNGD
RUS,2013,numerous radical elements from all parts of the world ,UNGD
RUS,2013,are the most combat-capable units of the opposition. ,UNGD
RUS,2013,The goals that they are pursuing have nothing to do with ,UNGD
RUS,2013,democracy but are based on intolerance and aimed at ,UNGD
RUS,2013,the destruction of secular States and the establishment ,UNGD
RUS,2013,of caliphates. It is difficult to qualify as far-sighted a ,UNGD
RUS,2013,policy that entails fighting in Mali the same extremist ,UNGD
RUS,2013,groups that are being supported in Syria.,UNGD
RUS,2013,,UNGD
RUS,2013,The use of chemical weapons is inadmissible. That ,UNGD
RUS,2013,"does not mean, however, that one can usurp the right ",UNGD
RUS,2013,to accuse and to render verdicts. All of the incidents ,UNGD
RUS,2013,"associated with the use of chemical weapons in Syria, ",UNGD
RUS,2013,"by whomsoever committed, must be investigated in a ",UNGD
RUS,2013,professional and unbiased manner and then considered ,UNGD
RUS,2013,by the Security Council exclusively on the basis of ,UNGD
RUS,2013,facts rather than of allegations or assumptions. In that ,UNGD
RUS,2013,"respect, at the Group of 20 (G-20) summit held in June, ",UNGD
RUS,2013,an agreement was reached by leaders of the eight key ,UNGD
RUS,2013,States.,UNGD
RUS,2013,,UNGD
RUS,2013,,UNGD
RUS,2013,,UNGD
RUS,2013,Recently a common argument has been ,UNGD
RUS,2013,increasingly made to the effect that the threat or use ,UNGD
RUS,2013,"of force, directly prohibited by the Charter of the ",UNGD
RUS,2013,"United Nations, is virtually the most effective method ",UNGD
RUS,2013,"of addressing international problems, including the ",UNGD
RUS,2013,settlement of domestic conflicts. There have been ,UNGD
RUS,2013,attempts to extrapolate such an approach to the ,UNGD
RUS,2013,"situation in Syria as well, despite the fact that recent ",UNGD
RUS,2013,experience with such interventions has proved that they ,UNGD
RUS,2013,"are ineffective, meaningless and destructive. That is an ",UNGD
RUS,2013,extremely dangerous path leading to the erosion of the ,UNGD
RUS,2013,foundations of today’s world order and the subversion ,UNGD
RUS,2013,of the weapons of mass destruction non-proliferation ,UNGD
RUS,2013,regimes.,UNGD
RUS,2013,,UNGD
RUS,2013,It is alarming to hear statements about the right ,UNGD
RUS,2013,to use military force to ensure one’s own interests in ,UNGD
RUS,2013,the Middle East region under the pretext of a persistent ,UNGD
RUS,2013,leadership gap in the international arena. Recent history ,UNGD
RUS,2013,"shows that no State, no matter how big or powerful, ",UNGD
RUS,2013,can cope alone with challenges of the scope faced by ,UNGD
RUS,2013,humankind today.,UNGD
RUS,2013,,UNGD
RUS,2013,There is no doubt that leadership is required. ,UNGD
RUS,2013,"However, today it can only be collective leadership ",UNGD
RUS,2013,based on agreed actions of the leading members of ,UNGD
RUS,2013,"the international community, with strict respect for ",UNGD
RUS,2013,the principles and norms of international law. It is ,UNGD
RUS,2013,the growing understanding of that reality that has ,UNGD
RUS,2013,opened the way towards achieving Russia-United ,UNGD
RUS,2013,States understandings relating to the placing under ,UNGD
RUS,2013,international control and subsequent elimination of the ,UNGD
RUS,2013,Syrian chemical arsenals. That became possible thanks ,UNGD
RUS,2013,to the decision by Damascus to join the Chemical ,UNGD
RUS,2013,Weapons Convention and fulfil the relevant obligations ,UNGD
RUS,2013,following the expedited procedure.,UNGD
RUS,2013,,UNGD
RUS,2013,We expect that the decisions of the Organization ,UNGD
RUS,2013,for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons Executive ,UNGD
RUS,2013,Council and the Security Council will contribute to ,UNGD
RUS,2013,creating the framework required for the elimination of ,UNGD
RUS,2013,chemical arsenals in Syria.,UNGD
RUS,2013,,UNGD
RUS,2013,Progress in the area of chemical disarmament in ,UNGD
RUS,2013,Syria should give impetus to the implementation of ,UNGD
RUS,2013,existing arrangements to convene a conference on ,UNGD
RUS,2013,establishing a zone free of weapons of mass destruction ,UNGD
RUS,2013,and their means of delivery in the Middle East. We know ,UNGD
RUS,2013,that there are a number of complicated issues related to ,UNGD
RUS,2013,ensuring full participation of the countries of the region ,UNGD
RUS,2013,"in such a conference, but they cannot be discussed ",UNGD
RUS,2013,endlessly. That is exactly when true leadership and ,UNGD
RUS,2013,resolve must be demonstrated for the common benefit.,UNGD
RUS,2013,,UNGD
RUS,2013,People are continuing to die and innocent civilians ,UNGD
RUS,2013,"to suffer every day in Syria. Religious minorities, ",UNGD
RUS,2013,"including Christian communities, are becoming ",UNGD
RUS,2013,"victims of the conflict, which is increasingly acquiring ",UNGD
RUS,2013,a sectarian character. Virtually the only possibility ,UNGD
RUS,2013,remaining today to put an end to this turmoil is ,UNGD
RUS,2013,to break the deadlock regarding the process of a ,UNGD
RUS,2013,political settlement of the Syrian crisis. We continue ,UNGD
RUS,2013,to work tirelessly for the earliest convening of a peace ,UNGD
RUS,2013,conference to implement the Geneva communiqué ,UNGD
RUS,2013,"of 30 July 2012 (S/2012/522, annex). We hope that, ",UNGD
RUS,2013,"following the example set by the Government of Syria, ",UNGD
RUS,2013,the opposition will also constructively respond to the ,UNGD
RUS,2013,Russia-United States initiative.,UNGD
RUS,2013,,UNGD
RUS,2013,The Syrian crisis should not overshadow the need to ,UNGD
RUS,2013,address the Palestinian problem. We expect the Israeli ,UNGD
RUS,2013,and Palestinian leaders to shoulder their responsibility ,UNGD
RUS,2013,for the future of their people at this current critical ,UNGD
RUS,2013,"stage, where the parties have resumed direct talks ",UNGD
RUS,2013,after a lengthy interruption. While duly recognizing ,UNGD
RUS,2013,the efforts made by the United States in the Middle ,UNGD
RUS,2013,"East settlement process, we deem it necessary to ",UNGD
RUS,2013,"intensify the activity of the Quartet, the internationally ",UNGD
RUS,2013,recognized mechanism for providing assistance to the ,UNGD
RUS,2013,peace process in the region on the basis of the relevant ,UNGD
RUS,2013,"decisions of the United Nations, the Madrid principles ",UNGD
RUS,2013,and the Arab Peace Initiative. It is also important to ,UNGD
RUS,2013,ensure the close involvement of the Arab countries in ,UNGD
RUS,2013,the activities of the Quartet.,UNGD
RUS,2013,,UNGD
RUS,2013,Approaches based on negotiation are also required ,UNGD
RUS,2013,"with respect to other situations, including the Iranian ",UNGD
RUS,2013,nuclear programme and the nuclear problem in the ,UNGD
RUS,2013,Korean peninsula. As President Vladimir Putin noted ,UNGD
RUS,2013,in his recent article in the 11 September 2013 issue of ,UNGD
RUS,2013,"The New York Times,",UNGD
RUS,2013,,UNGD
RUS,2013,“We must stop using the language of force and ,UNGD
RUS,2013,return to the path of civilized diplomatic and ,UNGD
RUS,2013,political settlement.”,UNGD
RUS,2013,This would help to improve the international ,UNGD
RUS,2013,environment and contribute to stepping up collective ,UNGD
RUS,2013,"efforts to counter global challenges, including terrorism ",UNGD
RUS,2013,and drug trafficking. Russia intends to attach priority ,UNGD
RUS,2013,attention to these challenges during its presidency of ,UNGD
RUS,2013,"the Group of Eight, in 2014.",UNGD
RUS,2013,,UNGD
RUS,2013,"Today, when the rigid frame of the bipolar system ",UNGD
RUS,2013,"has been long relegated to the past, a mark of the time ",UNGD
RUS,2013,is the strengthening of the democratic foundations both ,UNGD
RUS,2013,within States and in international relations. That means ,UNGD
RUS,2013,,UNGD
RUS,2013,,UNGD
RUS,2013,,UNGD
RUS,2013,in particular that the recognition of the right of peoples ,UNGD
RUS,2013,to independently determine their destiny and to choose ,UNGD
RUS,2013,the optimal forms of social and political structure ,UNGD
RUS,2013,and social and economic systems should become an ,UNGD
RUS,2013,"indisputable norm of conduct. In the same way, the ",UNGD
RUS,2013,complex of exclusiveness and supremacy regarding ,UNGD
RUS,2013,one’s own customs in the human rights area should be ,UNGD
RUS,2013,abandoned and instead the universal criteria enshrined ,UNGD
RUS,2013,in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights should ,UNGD
RUS,2013,"be used as a guideline. Moreover, it is important to ",UNGD
RUS,2013,respect the traditional values that are common to all ,UNGD
RUS,2013,the religions.,UNGD
RUS,2013,,UNGD
RUS,2013,It is obvious that a genuine partnership is hardly ,UNGD
RUS,2013,achievable without reliance on the foundations of ,UNGD
RUS,2013,economic cooperation. The prevailing majority of ,UNGD
RUS,2013,States are interacting within the framework of the ,UNGD
RUS,2013,World Trade Organization and in that sense they are ,UNGD
RUS,2013,already operating in a common economic space. ,UNGD
RUS,2013,This creates the prerequisites for working towards ,UNGD
RUS,2013,harmonization of integration processes in various ,UNGD
RUS,2013,regions of the world instead of trying to artificially pit ,UNGD
RUS,2013,them against each other by creating new division lines. ,UNGD
RUS,2013,Russia is proceeding from that exact understanding in ,UNGD
RUS,2013,its joint work with its partners in the establishment of ,UNGD
RUS,2013,the Eurasian Economic Union.,UNGD
RUS,2013,,UNGD
RUS,2013,Russia attaches great importance to achieving the ,UNGD
RUS,2013,Millennium Development Goals and the drafting of the ,UNGD
RUS,2013,global development agenda for the post-2015 period ,UNGD
RUS,2013,on their basis. The main priorities are the eradication ,UNGD
RUS,2013,of poverty and support for economic growth through ,UNGD
RUS,2013,the expansion of investment opportunities and the ,UNGD
RUS,2013,creation of new jobs. Some of the most urgent issues ,UNGD
RUS,2013,are the strengthening of the energy and transport ,UNGD
RUS,2013,"infrastructures, the fight against infectious diseases ",UNGD
RUS,2013,and road safety.,UNGD
RUS,2013,,UNGD
RUS,2013,Cooperation among States should rely on efficient ,UNGD
RUS,2013,mechanisms and an adequate resource base. In that ,UNGD
RUS,2013,"context, we support the further strengthening of the ",UNGD
RUS,2013,coordinating role and potential of the United Nations ,UNGD
RUS,2013,Economic and Social Council. During its chairmanship ,UNGD
RUS,2013,"of the Group of 20, Russia has consistently pursued ",UNGD
RUS,2013,a policy of developing its interaction with the United ,UNGD
RUS,2013,"Nations. We believe that the General Assembly, in ",UNGD
RUS,2013,"cooperation with the G-20, will develop a realistic ",UNGD
RUS,2013,programme of long-term cooperation.,UNGD
RUS,2013,,UNGD
RUS,2013,"I firmly believe that, by joining forces on the basis ",UNGD
RUS,2013,of genuine respect and considering the interests of each ,UNGD
RUS,2013,"and everyone, we will be able to achieve the lofty goals ",UNGD
RUS,2013,that are enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.,UNGD
RUS,2014,There is growing evidence today of a contradiction ,UNGD
RUS,2014,between the need for collective and partnership efforts ,UNGD
RUS,2014,in order to develop adequate responses to the challenges ,UNGD
RUS,2014,"common to us all, on the one hand, and, on the other, ",UNGD
RUS,2014,the aspiration of a number of States to domination and ,UNGD
RUS,2014,a revival of the archaic bloc thinking based on military ,UNGD
RUS,2014,drill discipline and the erroneous logic of friend or foe.,UNGD
RUS,2014,,UNGD
RUS,2014,"The United States-led Western alliance, which ",UNGD
RUS,2014,"portrays itself as a champion of democracy, the rule of ",UNGD
RUS,2014,"law and human rights within individual countries, acts ",UNGD

RUS,2014,the United Nations and trying to decide for everyone ,UNGD
RUS,2014,what is good or evil.,UNGD
RUS,2014,,UNGD
RUS,2014,Washington has openly declared its right to the ,UNGD
RUS,2014,unilateral use of military force anywhere to advocate ,UNGD
RUS,2014,its own interests. Military interference has become a ,UNGD
RUS,2014,"norm, despite the dismal outcome of all the operations ",UNGD
RUS,2014,involving the use of force that the United States has ,UNGD
RUS,2014,carried out in recent years.,UNGD
RUS,2014,,UNGD
RUS,2014,The sustainability of the international system has ,UNGD
RUS,2014,been severely shaken by the NATO bombardment of ,UNGD
RUS,2014,"Yugoslavia, the intervention in Iraq, the attack against ",UNGD
RUS,2014,Libya and the failure in Afghanistan. It was due only ,UNGD
RUS,2014,to intensive diplomatic efforts that aggression against ,UNGD
RUS,2014,Syria was prevented in 2013. The various colour ,UNGD
RUS,2014,revolutions and other schemes aimed at changing ,UNGD
RUS,2014,,UNGD
RUS,2014,,UNGD
RUS,2014,unsuitable regimes inevitably give the impression that ,UNGD
RUS,2014,their goal is to create chaos and instability.,UNGD
RUS,2014,,UNGD
RUS,2014,Today Ukraine has fallen victim to that policy. ,UNGD
RUS,2014,The situation there has revealed the deep-rooted and ,UNGD
RUS,2014,systemic flaws remaining in the existing Euro-Atlantic ,UNGD
RUS,2014,architecture. The West has embarked on a course ,UNGD
RUS,2014,towards a vertical structuring of humankind tailored to ,UNGD
RUS,2014,"its own standards, which are hardly inoffensive.",UNGD
RUS,2014,,UNGD
RUS,2014,After the West declared victory in the Cold War ,UNGD
RUS,2014,"and the so-called end of history, the United States and ",UNGD
RUS,2014,the European Union opted to expand the geopolitical ,UNGD
RUS,2014,area under their control without taking into account ,UNGD
RUS,2014,the balance of legitimate interests of all the peoples ,UNGD
RUS,2014,of Europe. The Western partners did not heed our ,UNGD
RUS,2014,numerous warnings with regard to the unacceptable ,UNGD
RUS,2014,violations of the principles of the Charter of the United ,UNGD
RUS,2014,"Nations and the Helsinki Final Act, and time and again ",UNGD
RUS,2014,they have avoided serious joint work to establish a ,UNGD

RUS,2014,cooperation from the Atlantic to the Pacific Oceans.,UNGD
RUS,2014,,UNGD
RUS,2014,The Russian proposal to draft a European security ,UNGD

RUS,2014,"binding security guarantees, and the NATO expansion ",UNGD

RUS,2014,,UNGD
RUS,2014,It must be stated honestly that no one has a ,UNGD

RUS,2014,recognizing that in every State democracy is “the worst ,UNGD

RUS,2014,honest information on the state of Libya’s chemical ,UNGD
RUS,2014,,UNGD
RUS,2014,,UNGD
RUS,2014,"arsenals. We understand that our NATO colleagues, ",UNGD
RUS,2014,having bombed the country in violation of Security ,UNGD
RUS,2014,"Council resolutions, do not want to stir up the disorder ",UNGD
RUS,2014,"they created. However, the problem of uncontrolled ",UNGD
RUS,2014,Libyan chemical arsenals is too serious to turn a blind ,UNGD
RUS,2014,eye to. We believe the Secretary-General must show his ,UNGD
RUS,2014,responsibility in that matter.,UNGD
RUS,2014,,UNGD
RUS,2014,The main thing today is to see the global priorities ,UNGD
RUS,2014,and avoid making them hostage to a one-sided agenda. ,UNGD
RUS,2014,There is an urgent need to refrain from double ,UNGD
RUS,2014,standards in approaches to conflict resolution. By ,UNGD
RUS,2014,"and large, everybody agrees that the key task is to ",UNGD
RUS,2014,"resolutely counter the terrorists, who are trying to ",UNGD
RUS,2014,"gain control of increasingly larger areas of Iraq, Syria, ",UNGD
RUS,2014,"Libya, Afghanistan and the Sahel-Sahara region. That ",UNGD
RUS,2014,"being the case, that problem cannot be sacrificed to ",UNGD
RUS,2014,"ideological schemes or to settle a score. Terrorists, ",UNGD
RUS,2014,"whatever slogans they hide behind, must be outlawed.",UNGD
RUS,2014,,UNGD
RUS,2014,"At the same time, of course, the fight against ",UNGD
RUS,2014,terrorism should be based on the solid foundation of ,UNGD
RUS,2014,international law. An important stage in that fight ,UNGD
RUS,2014,was the unanimous adoption of a series of Security ,UNGD
RUS,2014,"Council resolutions, including those on the issue of ",UNGD
RUS,2014,"foreign terrorist fighters. On the other hand, attempts ",UNGD
RUS,2014,to act contrary to the Charter of our Organization ,UNGD
RUS,2014,do not contribute to the success of joint efforts. The ,UNGD
RUS,2014,fight against terrorists in Syria should be built on ,UNGD
RUS,2014,"cooperation with the Syrian Government, which has ",UNGD
RUS,2014,clearly stated its willingness in that regard. Damascus ,UNGD
RUS,2014,has already demonstrated its ability to cooperate with ,UNGD
RUS,2014,the international community and to fulfil its obligations ,UNGD
RUS,2014,in the framework of the programme for eliminating its ,UNGD
RUS,2014,chemical weapons.,UNGD
RUS,2014,,UNGD
RUS,2014,"From the very outset of the Arab Spring, Russia ",UNGD
RUS,2014,urged that it not be abandoned to the control of ,UNGD
RUS,2014,"extremists, that a united front be created to counter the ",UNGD
RUS,2014,growing terrorist threat. We have warned against the ,UNGD
RUS,2014,temptation to take as allies almost anyone who declared ,UNGD
RUS,2014,"himself an enemy of Bashar Al-Assad, whether ",UNGD
RUS,2014,"Al-Qaida, Jabhat Al-Nusra and other fellow travellers ",UNGD
RUS,2014,"of regime change, including the Islamic State of Iraq ",UNGD
RUS,2014,"and the Levant (ISIL), which today is the focus of ",UNGD
RUS,2014,"attention. As they say, better late than never. This is not ",UNGD
RUS,2014,the first time that Russia is making a real contribution ,UNGD
RUS,2014,to the fight against ISIL and other terrorist groups in ,UNGD
RUS,2014,the region. We are delivering large-scale supplies of ,UNGD
RUS,2014,"arms and military equipment to Iraq, Syria and other ",UNGD
RUS,2014,"Middle Eastern and North African countries, and we ",UNGD
RUS,2014,will continue to support their efforts to suppress the ,UNGD
RUS,2014,terrorists.,UNGD
RUS,2014,,UNGD
RUS,2014,The terrorist threat requires a comprehensive ,UNGD
RUS,2014,approach if we want to eradicate its causes and not ,UNGD
RUS,2014,be doomed to reacting to the symptoms. ISIL is only ,UNGD
RUS,2014,"part of the problem. We propose to organize, under the ",UNGD
RUS,2014,"auspices of the Security Council, an in-depth study of ",UNGD
RUS,2014,the threat of extremism and terrorism in all of their ,UNGD
RUS,2014,aspects throughout the Middle East and North African ,UNGD
RUS,2014,region. That integrated approach also presupposes ,UNGD
RUS,2014,"that chronic conflicts should be considered, above ",UNGD
RUS,2014,all the Arab-Israeli conflict. The failure to settle the ,UNGD
RUS,2014,"Palestinian issue over several decades remains, as is ",UNGD
RUS,2014,"widely recognized, one of the main factors of instability ",UNGD
RUS,2014,"in the region, and that helps extremists to recruit more ",UNGD
RUS,2014,and more new jihadists.,UNGD
RUS,2014,,UNGD
RUS,2014,Another area of our common work together ,UNGD
RUS,2014,demanding attention is uniting our efforts to implement ,UNGD

RUS,2014,The United Nations was established on the ruins ,UNGD

RUS,2014,of its seventieth anniversary. We all have an obligation ,UNGD
RUS,2014,to celebrate in an appropriate manner the anniversary ,UNGD
RUS,2014,of the great victory and to pay tribute to the memory ,UNGD
RUS,2014,of all who perished for freedom and the right of each ,UNGD
RUS,2014,people to determine their own destiny. The lessons ,UNGD
RUS,2014,of that terrible war and the entire course of events in ,UNGD
RUS,2014,today’s world require us to join efforts and forget about ,UNGD
RUS,2014,unilateral interests and national electoral cycles when ,UNGD
RUS,2014,it comes to countering global threats to all humankind. ,UNGD
RUS,2014,National egoism should not be allowed to prevail over ,UNGD
RUS,2014,collective responsibility.,UNGD
RUS,2015,"The seventieth anniversary of the United Nations is a good opportunity both to consider our history and to talk about our collective future. In 1945, the countries that had defeated Nazism united their efforts to lay firm foundations for the post-war world order. I should point out here that the key decisions about the principles for guiding cooperation among States and the creation of the United Nations were made in our country, at the meeting in Yalta of the leaders of the coalition against Hitler. The Yalta system emerged out of genuine travail, paid for with tens of millions of lives and the two world wars that engulfed the world in the twentieth century. And in all fairness to it, it has helped humankind traverse the turbulent and sometimes dramatic events of the past seven decades and has spared the world major cataclysms.",UNGD
RUS,2015,"The United Nations is an Organization unique in its legitimacy, representativeness and universality. True, it has recently been much criticized for its perceived insufficient effectiveness and for decision-making on fundamental issues that can be stymied by insuperable differences, particularly among members of the Security Council. I would like to point out, however, that over the 70 years of the existence of the United Nations there have always been disagreements, and the right to the veto has always been exercised — by the United States, Great Britain, France, China, the Soviet Union and later Russia, alike. That is entirely natural for such a diverse and representative Organization. When the United Nations was established, there was",UNGD
RUS,2015,,UNGD
RUS,2015,"no suggestion that unanimity would reign. Indeed, the essence of the Organization consists in seeking and reaching compromise. Its strength lies in taking account of different opinions and points of view. The decisions that are discussed in the United Nations are either adopted as resolutions or they are not. As the diplomats say, they either go through or do not go through. Any action on the part of any State that bypasses that procedure is illegitimate and runs counter to the Charter of the United Nations and in defiance of international law.",UNGD
RUS,2015,"We all know that a single dominating power centre emerged in the world after the end of the Cold War. Those who found themselves at the top of that pyramid were tempted to think that if they were so strong and exceptional, they knew better than anyone else what should be done. As a consequence, they thought, why should they bother with the United Nations, which instead of automatically sanctioning and legitimizing necessary decisions frequently just stands in the way or, as we say, gets underfoot? It has become commonplace to say that the Organization, as originally conceived, has become obsolete and that its historical mission has been accomplished.",UNGD
RUS,2015,"The world is changing, of course, and the United Nations must keep up with that natural transformation. Russia is ready to work on that, based on a broad consensus with all its partners, but we consider efforts to undermine the authority and legitimacy of the United Nations to be extremely dangerous. They could lead to the collapse of the entire architecture of international relations. Then we would indeed be left with no rules beyond might is right. That would be a world ruled by selfishness rather than collective effort; a world ever more dictatorial and less about equality, genuine democracy and freedom; a world where an ever-growing number of de facto protectorates and externally controlled territories would replace truly independent States.",UNGD
RUS,2015,"What, after all, is State sovereignty, about which some of our colleagues have already spoken? More than anything it is about freedom — the freedom of every person, people or State to choose their own destiny. And by the way, the issue of the so-called legitimacy of State power also falls into this category. We should never play with words or manipulate them. Every term of international law and international affairs should be clear and transparent and possess uniformly understood criteria.",UNGD
RUS,2015,"We are all different, and we should respect that. Nobody is obliged to conform once and for all to a single model of development that someone has deemed to be the only right one. We should all remember what we have learned from past experience. For example, we remember instances from the history of the Soviet Union. Attempts to export social experiments and to push for change in one country or another based on our own ideological positions often led to tragic consequences and to deterioration rather than progress.",UNGD
RUS,2015,"It seems, however, that no one learns from others’ mistakes. They just repeat them, and the export of revolutions, this time so-called democratic revolutions, continues. We have only to look at the situation in the Middle East and North Africa, which the speaker before me discussed. Certainly, the political and social problems of the region have been brewing for a long time, and people there naturally wanted change.",UNGD
RUS,2015,"But how has it actually turned out? Instead of reforming Government institutions, aggressive foreign interference has resulted in the abrupt destruction of the very fabric of life. Instead of the triumph of democracy and progress we got violence, poverty and social catastrophe. And human rights, including the right to life, are simply ignored. One cannot help wanting to ask those who created this situation if they at least realize now what they have done. But I am afraid the question would go unanswered, because policies based on complacency and a belief in one’s exceptionality and impunity are never abandoned.",UNGD
RUS,2015,"It is now obvious that the power vacuum that has appeared in a number of the countries of the Middle East and North Africa has led to the emergence of areas of anarchy that immediately began to fill with extremists and terrorists. Tens of thousands of militants are now fighting under the banners of the so-called Islamic State. They include former Iraqi servicemen who were thrown out into the street in the wake of the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Another supplier of recruits is Libya, whose statehood was destroyed as a result of a gross violation of Security Council resolution 1973 (2011). And now members of the so-called moderate Syrian opposition, supported by the West, are joining the radical ranks. First they arm and train them, and now they are defecting to the so-called Islamic State. Indeed, the Islamic State itself did not come from nowhere. It, too, was initially forged as a tool against undesirable secular regimes. Having established a foothold in Syria and Iraq, the Islamic State is actively expanding into",UNGD
RUS,2015,"other regions, with the aim of dominating the Islamic world, and not just there. It is clearly not limiting itself to those plans alone.",UNGD
RUS,2015,"The situation is more than dangerous. In such circumstances, it is hypocritical and irresponsible to make loud declarations about the threat of international terrorism while turning a blind eye to the channels that are financing and supporting terrorists, including through the proceeds of drug trafficking and illicit trading in oil and arms, or to attempt to manipulate extremist groups and make them do one’s bidding in order to achieve one’s own political goals, in the hope of dealing with them — or, to put it more simply, liquidating them — later. What I have to say to those people is this: Sirs, while you are certainly dealing with cruel people, they are in no way stupid or primitive. They are just as smart as you, and you cannot yet tell who is using whom for his own ends. The recent information on the transfer of arms to the terrorists by that moderate opposition itself is the best proof of that.",UNGD
RUS,2015,"We believe that any attempt to flirt with terrorists, let alone arm them, is not just short-sighted; it is incendiary. It could result in a dramatic increase in the global terrorist threat and its critical spread to new regions, especially considering the fact that militants from many countries, including Europe, are passing through Islamic State training camps. Nor, unfortunately, I must admit frankly to my colleagues, is Russia an exception. We cannot allow such criminals, who have already smelled blood, to return home and continue their evil deeds there. We do not want that. And after all, would anyone want that?",UNGD
RUS,2015,"Russia has always been firm and consistent in opposing terrorism in all its forms. Today we are providing military and technical assistance to Iraq, Syria and other countries of the region that are fighting terrorist groups. We think it is an enormous mistake to refuse to cooperate with the Syrian authorities and the State armed forces, who are valiantly combating terrorism face to face. Finally, we should acknowledge that no one except President Al-Assad’s Government armed forces and the Kurdish militia is truly fighting the Islamic State and other terrorist organizations in Syria. We are aware of all the problems and contradictions in the region, but we must nonetheless be realistic.",UNGD
RUS,2015,I feel obliged to point out that Russia’s honest and straightforward approach has recently been used as a pretext for accusing us of harbouring increasing ambitions — as if the people saying that have no,UNGD
RUS,2015,"ambitions at all themselves. But the real issue is not Russia’s ambitions but the fact that we can no longer tolerate the current state of affairs in the world. In reality, we are proposing that we should be guided by our shared values and interests rather than ambitions. We should unite our efforts to address, on the basis of international law, these new problems we face and create a genuinely broad international coalition against terrorism. Like the coalition against Hitler, it could unite all the diverse forces willing to resolutely resist those who, like the Nazis, sow evil and hatred of humankind.",UNGD
RUS,2015,"And, naturally, Muslim countries should play a key role in that coalition. Not only is the Islamic State a direct threat to them, it also desecrates one of the world’s greatest religions with its bloody crimes. The militants’ ideologists make a mockery of Islam and pervert its true humanistic values. In that regard, I would also like to address Muslim spiritual leaders. Their authority and tutelage are vital at this moment. It is essential to prevent those whom militants try to recruit from making hasty decisions. And those who have been deceived and who by force of circumstance have ended up in the terrorists’ ranks must be helped to find a path back to normal life, lay down their arms and cease their fratricide.",UNGD
RUS,2015,"In the next few days Russia, as the current President of the Security Council, will convene a ministerial-level meeting aimed at conducting a comprehensive analysis of threats in the Middle East. First, we propose to discuss the possibility of agreeing on a draft resolution designed to coordinate the actions of all the forces confronting the Islamic State and other terrorist groups. Once again, that coordination should be based on the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.",UNGD
RUS,2015,"We believe that the international community can develop a comprehensive strategy for the political stabilization and social and economic recovery of the Middle East. Then there would be no need to build camps for refugees. The flood of people forced to leave their homelands has literally engulfed first the country’s neighbours and now Europe. Now they number in the hundreds of thousands, but they could soon be millions. This is a great and tragic new migration of peoples, and a harsh lesson for all of us, including Europe.",UNGD
RUS,2015,"I would like to stress that the refugees unquestionably need our compassion and support. However, any fundamental solution to the problem must involve restoring statehood where it has been",UNGD

Naturally, any assistance to sovereign States can and must be offered rather than imposed, and only in accordance with the United Nations Charter. In other words, everything being done or to be done in this area in accordance with the norms of international law must be backed by our universal Organization, and anything contravening the Charter must be rejected. More than anything, I believe it is vital to help restore Government institutions in Libya, support the new Government of Iraq and provide comprehensive assistance to the legitimate Government of Syria.",UNGD
RUS,2015,"Ensuring peace and regional and global stability remains the key task of the international community, with the United Nations at its helm. In our view, that means creating a space of equal and indivisible security that is not for the select few, but for everyone. Yes, it is a complex, difficult and time-consuming task, but there are no alternatives to it. However, for some of our colleagues the Cold War bloc mindset and desire to assimilate new geopolitical areas are still paramount. They began by continuing to expand NATO — and one wonders why, with the Warsaw Pact bloc no longer in existence and the Soviet Union broken up. And yet NATO is not only still there; like its military infrastructure, it is still expanding. Then they offered post-Soviet countries a false choice — to be either with the West or the East. Sooner or later, that logic of confrontation was bound to turn into a serious geopolitical crisis, and that is what happened in Ukraine, where the people’s dissatisfaction with the authorities was exploited and a military coup provoked from outside. A civil war erupted as a result.",UNGD
RUS,2015,"We firmly believe that we can end the bloodshed and find a way out of this deadlock only through full implementation, in good faith, of the Minsk agreements of 12 February. Ukraine’s territorial integrity cannot be ensured by threats and force of arms, but it must be done. What is needed is respect for the choice of the people of the Donbas region, genuine consideration of their interests and rights and their engagement in devising the key elements of the country’s political structure, in line with the Minsk agreements that will guarantee that Ukraine can develop as a civilized State and an essential link in the construction of a common",UNGD

RUS,2015,"I have a reason for speaking of a common area for economic cooperation. Only recently, it seemed that in the economic sphere, where the objective laws of the market apply, we would learn to live without dividing lines and to act on the basis of transparent rules, jointly devised, including the principles of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which stand for freedom of trade and investment and open competition. Today, however, unilateral sanctions that circumvent the United Nations Charter have almost become the norm. They not only serve political aims, they act as a way of pushing competitors out of the market.",UNGD
RUS,2015,"I would like to note another sign of growing economic selfishness. A number of countries have chosen to create closed, exclusive economic associations, with negotiations conducted behind closed doors and in secret, undisclosed to their own citizens and business communities. Nor do they inform other countries and Governments whose interests may be affected. Perhaps they want all of us to be left with the fait accompli that the rules of the game have been changed in favour of a small group, and without the participation of the WTO. That could completely unbalance the trade system and lead to the disintegration of the global economic environment. These issues affect the interests of all States and influence the future of the entire world economy. That is why we propose discussing them within the United Nations, the WTO and the Group of 20.",UNGD
RUS,2015,"In opposition to a policy of exclusiveness, Russia proposes harmonizing regional economic projects through what is known as the integration of integrations, based on the universal and transparent rules of international trade. One example is our plan to link the Eurasian Economic Union with China’s initiative in creating a Silk Road economic belt. And we continue to believe the possibility of harmonizing integration processes within the Eurasian Economic Union and the European Union to be very promising.",UNGD

It is in our interests to ensure that we get results at the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to be held in Paris in December.

We should be focusing on introducing fundamentally new technologies, inspired by nature, that rather than damaging the environment will be in harmony with it and will enable us to restore the balance between the biosphere and the technosphere that human activities have destroyed. It is indeed a challenge on a planetary scale, but I am confident that humankind has the intellectual wherewithal to respond to it. We must unite our efforts, most of all those States possessing solid research capacities and fundamental scientific achievements. We propose convening a special forum under United Nations auspices for a comprehensive consideration of the issues related to the depletion of natural resources, the destruction of habitats and climate change. Russia is ready to be one of the organizers of such a forum.",UNGD
RUS,2015,"On 10 January 1946, the General Assembly of the United Nations gathered in London to begin work on its first session. Eduardo Zuleta Ángel, a Colombian diplomat and the Chairman of the Preparatory Commission, opened the session by giving what I believe was a concise definition of the basic principles by which the United Nations should be guided in its activities. They are free will, disdain for scheming and trickery, and a spirit of cooperation. Today his words can be a guide for us all. Russia believes in the huge potential of the United Nations to help us avoid a new global confrontation and engage in strategic cooperation. We will work consistently with other countries to strengthen the central coordinating role of the United Nations. I am confident that together we can make the world a stable and safe place and ensure conditions conducive to the development of every State and nation.",UNGD
RUS,2016,"Last year, from this same rostrum, at the seventieth anniversary session of the General Assembly, much was said concerning the critical turning point in world development. The keynote was the recognition that humankind is moving from a bipolar and monopolar world order towards multipolar and democratic systems of international relations with regard to dealing with common challenges and threats, which we can overcome only through joint efforts. It was rightly stressed that there is a need to change the very philosophy of inter-State communication by avoiding attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of States or to impose development models on countries and peoples.",UNGD
RUS,2016,"Unfortunately, despite having acknowledged that fact, many Western countries continue to favour their entrenched ideas of mentoring, dominance, exclusiveness and the realization of self-interests by any means, rather than promote just and equitable cooperation. We see, in the bloodshed in the Middle East and North Africa, the consequences of such arrogance and their sense of infallibility in their pushing forward unilateral and reckless solutions to complex conflicts. As a result, the foundations of world stability are being destroyed. It is high time to draw the necessary lessons and avoid sinking into catastrophe in Syria.",UNGD
RUS,2016,"Largely thanks to Russia’s military response and assistance at the request of the legitimate Government of Syria, it has been possible to prevent the collapse of that country’s statehood and the disintegration of the country under the onslaught of terrorists. Our involvement provided the impetus for the establishment of the International Syria Support Group, which seeks to start a meaningful political process so that the Syrians themselves can determine the future of their country through an inclusive dialogue among all ethnic and religious groups. That is uncontestable. It has been acknowledged in the relevant Security Council resolutions and is enshrined in the recent agreements between Russia and the United States as Co-Chairs of the International Syria Support Group. We thank everyone who has supported us in those efforts.",UNGD
RUS,2016,"It is now essential to prevent the collapse of those agreements and to carry out an unbiased and impartial investigation into the incidents in Deir ez-Zor and Aleppo, which undermine the agreements, especially given that there are quite a few people wishing to sabotage both the agreements and a settlement of the conflict in Syria. It is crucial to comply with the demand of the Security Council to separate what is known as the moderate opposition from the terrorists. And, in that regard, a particular responsibility lies with the United States and the members of the United States- led coalition.",UNGD
RUS,2016,"If we truly wish to resolve the Syrian crisis and the appalling humanitarian situation there, the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham, Jabhat al-Nusrah and associated extremist groups must be suppressed. That is key to reaching a cessation of hostilities and national reconciliation. Today, it is unpardonable to put off intra-Syrian negotiations, as well as to impose preconditions to them. Everything must be done in line with Security Council resolution 2254 (2015).",UNGD
RUS,2016,"Sabotaging the process — in particular through the use of external forces, including their advisers and supporters — has a negative impact on the reputation of the United Nations and leads us to believe that the reason for it lies in an attempt to change the regime. We have seen that sort of zero-sum game in Ukraine, which is very close to us, in the unconstitutional attempts to overthrow the Government and now in Ukraine’s refusal to fulfil the Minsk Agreement of 12 February 2015. By and large, the attempt to use those conflicts to achieve self-serving geopolitical goals has been obvious to everyone.",UNGD
RUS,2016,"The latest meeting of the International Syria Contact Group gives us reason to remain very cautiously optimistic. More broadly, it is only through the genuine implementation of all agreements that we will be able to have, in the Euro-Atlantic area, equal and indivisible security for mutually beneficial cooperation, as was stated at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe nearly 20 years ago.",UNGD
RUS,2016,"Neither NATO nor the European Union will be able to replace a truly collective unification of efforts in the interest of all without losers and winners. And it is also utterly unacceptable to hold athletic competitions — which have always brought peoples together, strengthening friendship and mutual trust — hostage for reasons of political ambition. Attempts to manipulate the outcome of competitions does not honour those who flaunt their allegiance to fair competition but actually violate the General Assembly principles supporting the independence and autonomy of sports.",UNGD
RUS,2016,"In today’s world, we cannot be guided by the philosophy of the anti-heroes of George Orwell’s dystopic novel Animal Farm, where all animals are equal but some are more equal than others. In the enlightened twenty-first century, it is simply indecent to adopt the role of mentor to everyone else, reserving for oneself the right to use doping in sports, launch unilateral adventures bypassing the United Nations, conduct geopolitical experiments that cost millions of human lives, engage in the extraterritorial blackmail of everyone, including one’s closest allies, while what is really intended is to advance one’s own financial profit, or even to set the criteria for the greatness of a particular country. All of that is unworthy of the principles of freedom and equality, on the basis of which great nations have grown and which are now being used by their elites to threaten the entire world.",UNGD
RUS,2016,"This year, we mark the seventieth anniversary of the Nuremberg Tribunal decisions. The anniversary cautions us against forgetting the lessons of the Second World War and reminds us of the catastrophic consequences of attempting to determine the fate of the world by suppressing the legitimate interests of other States and peoples. The freedoms of expression and peaceful assembly should not be used as a cover for condoning radical movements that profess a Nazi ideology and support the glorification of the Nazis and their accomplices. The persistence of such vicious instincts dictates the need for consistent efforts to place a solid barrier in the way of neo-Nazism and revanchism, strengthen inter-ethnic and intercultural accord and rally the young generation around the ideas of justice and equality. We invite everyone to take part in the nineteenth World Festival of Youth and Students in Sochi in October 2017.",UNGD

That entails the need to learn to respect one’s partners and respect the cultural and civilizational diversity of the modern world. We must therefore return to our origins — the norms and principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter and other instruments of the world Organization. Our commitment to that approach was reaffirmed in the Declaration of the Russian Federation and the People’s Republic of China on the Promotion of International Law, signed on 25 June. The observance of the principles of the sovereign equality of States and non-interference in their internal affairs should become a measure of the decency and legitimacy of any member of the world community.",UNGD

There should be no place for double standards in fighting terrorism. Truly universal joint efforts are required to create a broad counter- terrorist front, as President Putin proposed from this rostrum last year (see A/70/PV.13). The tragedies in Iraq, Libya, Yemen and Syria have proved the need to stop opportunistic attempts to use extremists as a way to advance geopolitical intentions. Before it is too late, it is necessary to think about the task of preventing the proliferation of terrorist and extremist ideology, which literally holds youth hostage in various regions of the world. We are drafting a Security Council resolution aimed at mobilizing efforts to eliminate such evils. We are looking forward to support for our initiative.",UNGD

RUS,2016,"We are also seriously concerned about non-proliferation and arms control. There have been attempts to replace the key objectives of maintaining strategic stability in all its components with populist slogans of “nuclear zero”. We see a number of countries possessing nuclear arsenals not participating in the existing treaties. The fundamental Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is being put to a serious test. Its parties find it more difficult to speak a common language, especially in a situation when certain nuclear Powers torpedo any compromises regarding the start of the negotiations on the establishment of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery in the Middle East.",UNGD
RUS,2016,"Russia has consistently supported the liberation of humankind from the threat of nuclear weapons and other types of weapons of mass destruction. However, progress towards nuclear disarmament must be made in the context of the full consideration of a whole set of factors that affect strategic stability, including the impact of unilateral global missile defence systems, the development of strategic non-nuclear strike weapons, the threat of the placement of weapons in outer space, the inability to ensure the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, and the growing imbalance in conventional arms in Europe.",UNGD
RUS,2016,We note the growing support for our initiative to draft an international convention for the suppression of acts of chemical and biological terrorism. The start of serious negotiations on that issue and on the Russia-China draft treaty on the prevention of the placement of weapons in outer space would help break the impasse in the key body of the United Nations multilateral disarmament architecture: the Conference on Disarmament. We call for substantial examination of our proposals to improve the Convention on Biological and Toxin Weapons.,UNGD
RUS,2016,"NATO member countries brought conventional arms control in Europe to a deep deadlock. Our attempts to save it have faced a tough ideology-driven counteraction. All ideas to return to that issue would be meaningful only if NATO countries recognized the absolute futility of ultimatums aimed at achieving unilateral advantages. We continue to be open to an equitable and mutually respectful dialogue with NATO, including through the Collective Security Treaty Organization.",UNGD
RUS,2016,"It is necessary to work towards strengthening stability and equal and indivisible security in other parts of the world, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. The recent actions of North Korea, which violate Security Council resolutions, must be stopped. We call on Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear-missile programmes and return to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons regime. However, it is inadmissible to use that situation as a pretext for a massive militarization of North-East Asia and a deployment of another set of United States global missile-defence systems. All sides must refrain from the further escalation of tension and embark on the way toward a political and diplomatic settlement of the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula through the resumption of the talks.",UNGD

I would like to underline that the aforementioned initiative is open and fully in line with the earlier plans to create a trade bloc between Russia and the European Union and is founded on the basis of World Trade Organization norms and principles, unlike other projects involving close trade blocs that undermine the unity of global trade systems.",UNGD

An overwhelming majority of Member States voted in favour of the resolution. The minority was chiefly represented by the very countries that, contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, are attempting to dominate world affairs and impose their own development models and values on other States and peoples, led by a one-sided logic that undermines international law.",UNGD

We were pleased that United States President Donald Trump unequivocally stated from this rostrum the day before yesterday that it is important to comply with the principles of sovereignty in international affairs and to lead by example rather than by imposing one’s will on other nations, and that countries with different values, cultures and aspirations can not only coexist but can work side by side on a basis of mutual respect. I believe that we can all subscribe to those words, especially if United States foreign policy will in fact be conducted on that basis.",UNGD

In the past quarter century, despite challenges, our country has taken on in good faith its share of the work of eliminating the legacy of the Cold War and has done much to strengthen trust and understanding in Europe, the Atlantic region and all over the world. However, that has not been reciprocated by our Western partners, intoxicated as they were by the illusion of the onset of the end of history, and who are still trying to adapt rudimentary institutions designed for an era of bloc-versus-bloc confrontation to today’s realities. NATO wants to recreate the climate of the Cold War and refuses to implement the principle it solemnly declared in the 1990s — equal and indivisible security throughout the region of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.",UNGD
RUS,2017,"The West has built its policies according to the principle of “he who is not with us is against us”, and has proceeded with the heedless expansion of NATO eastwards, fomenting instability in post-Soviet geopolitics and inciting anti-Russian feeling. It is that policy that lies at the root of the protracted conflict in Ukraine. Despite the efforts of the Normandy format and the Trilateral Contact Group, the authorities in Kyiv constantly come up with new ploys to interfere with the implementation of their commitments under the package of measures outlined in the Minsk agreements of 12 February 2015 and endorsed by the Security Council.",UNGD
RUS,2017,"But even in those circumstances, Russia has been focused on constructive effort and on finding mutually acceptable ways to implement the Minsk agreements. In response to concerns that have been expressed about the current security situation, President Putin has launched an initiative to establish a United Nations mission to protect the OSCE observers in the Donbas region, and a corresponding draft resolution has been introduced in the Security Council. We believe Russia’s proposal will help to facilitate a settlement of the internal crisis in Ukraine that resulted from the anti-constitutional coup led by ultra-radicals. We hope for constructive interaction on the issues with our European and United States partners, without zero-sum games.",UNGD

The decisions of the Nuremberg Tribunal were a warning against forgetting the lessons of the Second World War and the disastrous consequences of attempts to take control of the world’s destiny by trampling on the lawful interests of other nations and peoples. It is disgusting to use concerns about freedom of expression as a pretext for condoning radical movements that preach neo-Nazi ideology and support the glorification of Nazis and their associates. We need constant vigilance to maintain a secure shield against neo-Nazism, revanchism, extremism and xenophobia and strengthen international and intercultural harmony.",UNGD

Civilized Europe tolerates the demolition of monuments to the liberators of the continent and heroes of the Second World War whose victory was the foundation for the United Nations. We think this issue should be a priority for immediate attention from the General Assembly and UNESCO with a view to establishing a legal framework to prevent such actions, and Russia intends to submit proposals for it. The continuing indifference to the shameful issue of statelessness that persists in Europe is also unacceptable, as is the suppression of minority languages, which is a gross violation of Council of Europe conventions.",UNGD
RUS,2017,"History has shown us throughout the ages that arriving at lasting settlements to disputes is possible only through dialogue and finding a balance between the conflicting parties’ core interests. Unfortunately, outright pressure is replacing diplomacy increasingly often in the arsenals of a number of Western countries. Imposing unilateral sanctions on top of those authorized by the Security Council is an illegitimate act that undermines the collective international effort. Today we have all been watching with alarm as the United States has imposed yet another set of restrictions — in fact, extraterritorial restrictions — on Iran, and threatening the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which has become a key factor in international and regional stability. The United States embargo on Cuba, which has gone on for more than half a century, is a demonstration of the uselessness of policies involving unilateral sanctions, and almost every Member State has been calling for it to be lifted for decades. It is time to listen to them.",UNGD

We firmly condemn Pyongyang’s adventurist nuclear- missile manoeuvres, which violate Security Council resolutions. But whipping up military hysteria is not only a blind alley, it is a deadly one. It goes without saying that all Security Council resolutions must be implemented but, along with sanctions, they all include provisions on the importance of resuming talks. We must stop blocking those provisions. There is no alternative to the political and diplomatic route, based on a dialogue among all interested parties, for addressing the Korean peninsula’s nuclear problem.

In any internal conflict, the international community must encourage the parties to take the path of national reconciliation and compromise. Efforts to ignore the opinions of others and resort to decrees and ultimatums, or to use force to circumvent the Charter of United Nations, have never done any good. The explosion of international terrorism, the millions of refugees and unprecedented waves of illegal migration are to a large degree the result of the attempts of the past few years to achieve regime change, including through the armed interventions that have wreaked havoc and destruction in the Middle East and North Africa and have paved the way for terrorists in parts of the world where they had never appeared before.",UNGD

The agreements create the conditions for further progress towards implementing Security Council resolution 2254 (2015) on the basis of direct dialogue between the Government and the opposition aimed at uniting their efforts to eliminate the terrorist epicentre as soon as possible and restoring peace and unity throughout the country, while resolving its acute humanitarian problems. The most urgent task is to increase the supplies of humanitarian aid and demining the liberated territories. We believe firmly that anyone who sincerely desires peace for Syria and its people should take part in this process under the leadership of the United Nations and without any preconditions. The incidents where chemical weapons have been used in the region are a separate issue. Every case should be investigated honestly and professionally, with no attempts to manipulate the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons-United Nations Joint Investigative Mechanism.",UNGD

In all of those situations, as with any conflict, Russia is pursuing a balanced policy and working with all parties without exception. With regard to issues in the Middle East and North Africa, we cannot put United Nations decisions on the Palestinian question and the Arab Peace Initiative on the backburner, much less consign them to oblivion. We believe that restoring Palestinian unity is crucial and welcome Egypt’s efforts in that direction. Russia is ready to assist in every possible way with the resumption of direct talks between Israel and Palestine, and to cooperate with its partners in the Quartet and the Arab League of States for that purpose. As long as the Palestinian question goes unresolved, it will continue to be exploited by extremists, who are attracting ever more new recruits.",UNGD

The International Olympic Movement, and sports in general, should remain outside politics. First and foremost, we must foster in young people respect for the cultural and civilizational diversity of today’s world. We invite everybody to the nineteenth World Festival of Youth and Students, which my country will host in Sochi less than a month from now. Another important event will take place in Russia at the same time, when St. Petersburg convenes the 137th Inter-Parliamentary Union Assembly, at which the main topic for discussion will be “Promoting cultural pluralism and peace through interfaith and inter-ethnic dialogue”. Let us encourage dialogue among various cultures and religions and stop using historical events to foment hatred and fear.",UNGD
RUS,2017,"A philosophy of coexistence, unity and harmonization of countries’ different interests underlies President Vladimir Putin’s proposal for a greater Eurasian partnership, open to all States of Asia and Europe, with the goal of creating an economic and humanitarian space based on the principle of the indivisibility of security. It goes without saying that equal rights for all, individuals and States, would be a universal requirement, as stated in the Charter of the United Nations. Those just and equitable principles form the foundation for the activities of various organizations in which Russia actively participates, including the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Collective Security Treaty Organization, the Eurasian Economic Union, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the BRICS group of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. We also continue to build relations with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the African Union, the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States and other associations of Asian, African and Latin American countries. Through our joint efforts we have achieved a more balanced approach in the work of organizations such as the Group of 20, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.",UNGD
RUS,2017,"We believe in the vitality of this Organization and would like the Secretary-General to play an active role in facilitating the full realization of its potential based on the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, while respecting the prerogatives of its intergovernmental bodies. Peacekeeping reform in particular requires a carefully tailored approach, without abrupt shifts or abandoning decades of invaluable accumulated experience.",UNGD
RUS,2017,"Two thousand years ago, the Roman philosopher Seneca wrote, “We are born to live together”. The founding fathers of the United Nations understood that better than anyone. They believed — and enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations — that our God-given existence on a single planet should compel all of us to unite in order to prevent the scourge of new wars. If we are to do that today, we badly need to revive the culture of diplomacy and dialogue and the quest for a balance of our interests, rather than making rash, instinctive decisions in our desire to punish those who disobey us. What this is really about is preserving humankind in all its richness and diversity. Russia has always been, and always will be, open to working together with all those who show that they are ready to meet halfway and cooperate on a basis of equality and mutual respect. We will continue to uphold those principles in the work of the United Nations in the interests of improving global governance and genuinely democratizating international relations.",UNGD
