USA,1970,"1.	 It is my privilege to extend to you once again the warm congratulations of the United States delegation on your election to the Presidency of the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Your country has few peers in the contributions it has made to the work of this Organization. Your father was a leader in the League of Nations, and now, in this session of the General Assembly, you are adding a new chapter in the family tradition. In the United Nations community we have long known you as an able spokesman of your country, as a participant in the life of the United Nations from its very beginning and an authority on the Charter, as a leading scholar and practitioner in international law, and as one whose personal outlook is strongly humanitarian and imbued with hope and determination for a better future. We are indeed fortunate to have you to lead us in this session devoted to the strengthening and improvement of the United Nations.",UNGD
USA,1970,"2.	During this session we shall commemorate with fitting ceremony one of the most creative and hopeful events of this century, the founding of the United Nations twenty-five years ago. It is right that this commemoration should be held. It is far more important, however, that the nations gathered at this session should so act together as to strengthen the United Nations for the future, to ensure that we are closer to ""peace, justice and progress"" five, ten and twenty- five years hence than we are today. The world is unlikely to care much what we say about the past. It will care a great deal what we do about the future.",UNGD
USA,1970,"3.	The problems the world faces today are no less grave than those it faced twenty-five years ago. Indeed they are in many respects far graver. Unless and until the Members of the United Nations demonstrate their willingness to deal effectively with these problems, the confidence of the world's peoples in the United Nations will remain uncertain and precarious.",UNGD
USA,1970,"4.	In the view of the United States, the most critical international problem today is the same as that which faced the founders of the United Nations: the need to build a reliable framework for peace and security among nations. As President Nixon said in this Assembly a year ago: ""... there is no nobler destiny, nor any greater gift that one age could make to the ages that follow, than to forge the key to a lasting peace"". [1755th meeting, para. 45.]",UNGD
USA,1970,"5.	In this conviction the United States has sought in the last two years to frame foreign policies which would help to make the international scene less destructively competitive, less strident, more cooperative and orderly. We have sought, in the spirit of the Charter, to pursue peaceful settlement of all conflicts and confrontations, and we have urged others to do likewise.",UNGD
USA,1970,"6.	The most significant of these efforts has been the strategic arms limitation discussions between my country and the Soviet Union. If at last we can check the nuclear arms race, the world will have been helped to move away from its gravest danger and toward new and more rational relationships.",UNGD
USA,1970,"7.	The United States also seeks, through a process of serious negotiation, to ease the tensions that arise from the division of Europe. We have welcomed the efforts of the Federal Republic of Germany to normalize relations with its eastern neighbors; we are seeking in fourPower talks to assure the security and wellbeing of the residents of Berlin; we have joined our NATO allies in proposing exploratory talks on the reduction of forces in central Europe. We hope these efforts will find the Soviet Union and its allies forthcoming.",UNGD
USA,1970,"8.	In VietNam, over eighteen months ago, the United States reversed the trend in American involvement in the war. We began a steady, uninterrupted reduction in the number of our troops. We have made a negotiated peace our highest priority. Although North VietNam has as yet shown no serious intention to negotiate a solution under which the South VietNamese people can freely decide their own future, this remains our goal and we shall not be discouraged in seeking it.",UNGD
USA,1970,A/PV.1854,UNGD
USA,1970,"9.	My Government has likewise sought ways to move toward a constructive relationship with mainland China. To this end, we have taken a number of unilateral steps to ease tensions. We are ready at any time to resume the talks in Warsaw.",UNGD
USA,1970,"10.	Finally, nowhere in the world today is there more urgent need to move from confrontation to negotiation than in the Middle East. The legacy of bitterness, hatred and suspicion there contains the seeds of even greater tragedy not only for the Middle East but for the world, unless there is early progress toward reconciliation and peace based on the legitimate interests of all the States and peoples of the region.",UNGD
USA,1970,"11.	As the United Nations community well knows, the United States has made major diplomatic efforts in recent months and weeks to help bring about peace at long last in the Middle East. While recent developments in the area, including the tragic death of President Nasser, have cast a shadow over the high hopes of just a few weeks ago that a beginning toward that goal had been made, those hopes have not been extinguished. For the most part, the guns remain silent along the ceasefire lines. Security Council resolution 242 (1967) stands as a beacon pointing the way to peace, and the parties concerned, in accepting the United States initiative of June, have committed themselves to carry out that resolution in all its parts. Ambassador Jarring is ready to resume his mission whenever conditions permit. We earnestly hope that the parties themselves and all others concerned will now bend every effort to the task of building on the beginning that has already been made.",UNGD
USA,1970,"12.	This will require above all serious steps to restore and strengthen confidence in the integrity of the ceasefire and military standstill agreement along the Suez Canal. It will also require, if negotiations are to move forward, a willingness by the parties to move from their maximum positions on the elements of a realistic and equitable peace settlement. In this spirit, my Government is prepared to contribute to renewed efforts toward peace in the Middle East.",UNGD
USA,1970,"13.	In this anniversary year the United States, like many other Members, has given especially careful thought to means by which the United Nations can be better enabled to fulfill its purposes.",UNGD
USA,1970,"14.	My delegation has listened, and will continue to listen attentively, to the suggestions of others in this regard. In the same spirit the United States will offer proposals, or support the proposals of others, with these objectives among others: first, to put United Nations peacekeeping operations on a firmer and more reliable basis; second, to make the United Nations more effective in the peaceful settlement of disputes; third, to promote new steps in the field of disarmament; fourth, to move closer by peaceful means to the goals of decolonization and human equality; fifth, to support the Second Development Decade; sixth, to help slow down too rapid rates of population growth; seventh, to promote the exploitation of the seabeds and outer space for human benefit; eighth, to organize common action within the United Nations to safeguard the global environment; ninth, to encourage young people from all parts of the world to devote themselves to international service; tenth, to improve the organization, administration and procedures of the United Nations.",UNGD
USA,1970,"15.	If the twenty-fifth General Assembly were to move forward substantially in these directions, this session would indeed rank as one of the most fruitful in United Nations history.",UNGD
USA,1970,16.	Let me now comment briefly on these points.,UNGD
USA,1970,"17.	We shall all of us on this podium and in the First Committee have much to say during this session about strengthening international peace and security, and about the need to live up to the Charter. This is quite proper. However, what is needed most in this respect is not still more sweeping declarations that merely restate the purposes and principles of the Charter. What is needed is more effective United Nations action on the concrete issues before us, on the Middle East, on United Nations peacekeeping procedures, on means of pacific settlement. Until we demonstrate our willingness to take such effective action, world opinion will continue to be skeptical, no matter what ringing declarations we may make, as to whether the Members of the United Nations are really serious about strengthening international peace and security.",UNGD
USA,1970,18.	I now come to a subject which should be at the very center of our concern if we wish in fact to strengthen peace and security through the United Nations. I speak of United Nations peacekeeping.,UNGD
USA,1970,"19.	Because the world situation in the past twenty- five years developed differently from what the founders of the United Nations foresaw, it has not been found possible to create forces for the maintenance of international peace and security along the lines laid down in certain articles of Chapter VII. We would hope that at some point the provisions of the Charter designed for enforcement action can be implemented.",UNGD
USA,1970,"20.	In the meantime, however, a modus vivendi has been built up, entirely consistent with the Charter, which has carried out significant and successful peacekeeping operations, sometimes with observers, sometimes with substantial forces, in the Middle East, in Kashmir, in the Congo, in Cyprus and elsewhere. Still it is all too clear that these ad hoc and improvised arrangements need major improvement in several respects if future peacekeeping is to be effective.",UNGD
USA,1970,"21.	The Assembly's Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations, under the able and patient leadership of Ambassador Cuevas Cancino of Mexico, has been laboring for nearly two years at the task of developing peacekeeping guidelines. During the past year the United States has put forward concrete proposals for new procedures that would meet the political concerns of all and yet allow United Nations forces to move rapidly to carry out decisions of the Security Council. But the broad agreement that all desire is still lacking.",UNGD
USA,1970,"22.	It is high time however that the General Assembly, in this twenty-fifth anniversary year, demanded significant movement on this problem. It would be a mistake not to move at all until all are agreed to move all the way. There is strong reason and sufficient consensus for some forward movement at this Assembly. The United States will be prepared to join with others in concrete proposals to this effect.",UNGD
USA,1970,"23.	In this connexion we welcome the statement made at Lusaka in the Declaration of the nonaligned countries concerning the United Nations, that measures should be taken at this session of the General Assembly to strengthen United Nations peacekeeping, and we look forward with interest to proposals that may be made by those present at that meeting.",UNGD
USA,1970,"24.	Of course, peacekeeping without peaceful settlement is only an expedient, necessary but incomplete and inconclusive. The most potent preventive of conflict is not machinery but the will of disputing parties to show restraint and a spirit of conciliation, and to persist in peaceful methods until settlement is reached. This is a solemn obligation of every United Nations Member under the Charter, and no nation deserves more honor than those who have lived up to it in spite of every obstacle.",UNGD
USA,1970,"25.	In this past year such peaceful settlements, or major steps towards them, have been recorded in a number of situations which reflect great credit on the statesmanship of those involved. I have in mind, for example, the progress made, with the assistance of the Organization of American States, toward resolving the dispute between El Salvador and Honduras; and also the recent peaceful decision on the future of Bahrain, in which good offices provided by the Secretary General played a major role.",UNGD
USA,1970,"26.	As these cases show, where the will to settle exists, effective machinery can do much to help. This is true of regional organizations, and it is no less true of the relevant organs of the United Nations, above all the Security Council.",UNGD
USA,1970,"27.	In this connexion we have welcomed the Security Council's decision [see 1544th meeting] as proposed by Finland, to hold periodic high-level meetings under Article 28 of the Charter. My country looks forward to taking part in the first such meeting later this fall. We welcome likewise the valuable suggestion of Brazil committees of the Council, including the parties to a dispute, might be created to help settle particular disputes.",UNGD
USA,1970,"28.	To the same end, the United States would favor the reactivation of certain machinery for peaceful settlement which has long been dormant. Many years ago the General Assembly created a Panel on Inquiry and Conciliation [resolution 268 (III)], and more recently a register of fact-finding experts. My Government will soon nominate qualified individuals for both of these bodies. We believe fact-finders should be available to",UNGD
USA,1970,"1 Third Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non Aligned Countries, held at Lusaka, Zambia, from 8 to 10 September 1970.",UNGD
USA,1970,"the SecretaryGeneral or other organs of the United Nations, or directly to Member States, to report on the facts of situations of international concern at the request or with the consent of one or more of the parties.",UNGD
USA,1970,"29.	Finally, it is most important that we rejuvenate and strengthen the highest organ of judicial settlement, the International Court of Justice. The United States recently joined with others in the Security Council in referring to the Court for its advisory opinion certain aspects of the Namibia situation. We have also joined with others in submitting to this General Assembly an agenda item calling for a review of the role of the Court. We hope this review will suggest ways to enable the Court to make a more substantial contribution to the establishment of the rule of law among nations.",UNGD
USA,1970,"30.	The world has witnessed in recent weeks shocking examples of the consequences of failure to abide by this rule of law examples which have been alluded to by numerous previous speakers on this podium. Hundreds of innocent individuals engaged in peaceful international travel have been brutally seized as hostages in a conflict in which they were in no way involved. Not only their safety and convenience have been placed in jeopardy but their very lives. As President Nixon pointed out in this forum a year ago, this issue ""involves the interests of. . . every air passenger and the integrity of that structure of order upon which a world community depends"" [1755th meeting, para. 74].",UNGD
USA,1970,"31.	That this view is widely shared is evident from the almost universal condemnation of these most recent acts by Governments the world over and by the resolution on this matter adopted unanimously by the Security Council [286 (1970)]. But condemnation is not enough. It is time to act. The Tokyo Convention, providing for the prompt return of hijacked aircraft passengers and crew, requires the broadest international support. The same is true of the International Civil Aviation Organization's draft multilateral convention for the extradition and punishment of hijackers. In addition, the United States has submitted new proposals to the ICAO, for which I urge your most earnest consideration and support.",UNGD
USA,1970,"32.	The General Assembly's extensive annual debates and resolutions on many aspects of arms control and disarmament have long played, and continue to play, an important part in international negotiations on this most critical of all our problems. I need only mention the partial nuclear test-ban Treaty,  the outer space Treaty [resolution 2222 (XXI)] and the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)]. The disarmament conference at Geneva has this year registered significant progress by achieving wide consensus on a draft treaty to prohibit the emplacement of weapons of mass destruction on a vast area of the earth's surface the seabed beneath the oceans.  We hope this draft treaty will be supported by the General Assembly at this session and opened for signature shortly thereafter.",UNGD
USA,1970,"33.	I can assure the Assembly that the United States Government is unceasingly aware of the worldwide concern and need for an end to the arms race and the perilous burden of armaments in all its forms, and that we shall do whatever one negotiating partner can do to bring about new agreements on new steps toward the ultimate goal of general and complete disarmament.",UNGD
USA,1970,34.	Permit me to say a word about a matter of quite different but equally wide concern that of human rights throughout the world.,UNGD
USA,1970,"35.	In addition to the basic responsibility of Governments to maintain human rights for all their citizens, the United Nations under the Charter has a clear responsibility in this regard. To strengthen the implementation of that responsibility my Government hopes the General Assembly at this session will create a new post, that of High Commissioner for Human Rights, to advise United Nations organs in this field and to assist States, at their request, with human rights problems. This proposal has been thoroughly studied and fully justified. It deserves a high priority at the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly.",UNGD
USA,1970,"36.	A particular issue of human rights that is of acute concern to my Government, among others, is the protection of the rights of prisoners of war. While these rights have long since been internationally guaranteed, they are in practice still denied to many prisoners of war, as American wives and families of such prisoners know to their great sorrow. The United States strongly hopes that this Assembly will press for worldwide observance of the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, verified by impartial inspection. It is intolerable that the tragedy of armed conflict should be compounded by additional inhumanities in violation of international norms.",UNGD
USA,1970,37.	In no field have the aims of the United Nations found more dramatic fulfilment during its first quarter of a century than in the field of decolonization. Before the Second World War a third of mankind lived in colonial dependencies. Today the proportion is less than 1 per cent. A revolution of independence has created some sixty new nations and has been the main factor in increasing the membership of the United Nations from 51 to 126.,UNGD
USA,1970,"38.	However, the situation in much of southern Africa is still characterized by the denial of self-determination and of racial equality. The United Nations and its member States must continue to exert peaceful efforts to defend and advance these basic human rights of the peoples concerned. Their cause is just and must in time prevail.",UNGD
USA,1970,"39.	Against these evils the United States in recent months has taken further steps. We put into effect last May a new policy designed to discourage United States investment in, and trade with, Namibia so long as South Africa remains in unlawful occupation. We urge other Governments to join us in this policy. My Government continues strictly to observe resolutions in regard to sanctions against the illegal regime in Rhodesia and in regard to the sale of arms to South Africa. We have closed our consulate in Salisbury. We shall continue in every peaceful and practicable way to pursue the ends of justice, equality and self determination.",UNGD
USA,1970,"40.	High on the list of the United Nations contributions to human progress is its longstanding effort to assist in comprehensive global development. That effort is being continued and, we hope, improved and strengthened through the launching of the Second United Nations Development Decade.",UNGD
USA,1970,"41.	The success of the Decade will depend most of all on the policies of Member States, both developed and developing. To bring all these policies into effective focus is the ambitious aim of the development strategy. The United States strongly supports the strategy which is before this Assembly [A 17982, para. 16] and intends to participate fully in this common enterprise.",UNGD
USA,1970,"42.	I wish to leave no doubt of the serious commitment of the United States to the Second Development Decade. President Nixon, in a series of policy decisions and especially in his recent announcement on the new focus of United States economic assistance, has made clear our intention:",UNGD
USA,1970,(a)	To reverse the downward trend in United States development assistance;,UNGD
USA,1970,"(b)	To increase substantially United States contributions to multilateral development institutions including the World Bank, the International Development Association, the regional development banks and the United Nations Development program so that, as the capabilities of these institutions increase, we may be able to channel through them most of our official development assistance;",UNGD
USA,1970,"(c)	Further to encourage the efforts of donor nations to ""untie"" their bilateral aid to developing countries from the obligation to import products of the donor country;",UNGD
USA,1970,"(<d) To bring United States science and technology more effectively to bear on the problems of development, and for this purpose to create a new United States International Development Institute;",UNGD
USA,1970,(<?) To take new steps to stimulate American private investment in developing countries within the framework of the developing countries' plans.,UNGD
USA,1970,"43.	These approaches are already reflected in the new policies my country has announced toward Latin America and Africa, which stress continued assistance, greater multilateral participation, and increased trade and investment.",UNGD
USA,1970,"44.	Finally, bearing in mind the crucial connexion between trade and development, the United States is pressing for a liberalized system of generalized tariff preferences for products of developing countries, with preferential access to the American market, and we are urging that the developing countries receive similar access to the markets of all developed countries.",UNGD
USA,1970,"45.	I wish to add a particular comment on the role of the United Nations Development program. This program, in cooperation with the specialized agencies, has done important pioneering work in development assistance. Its machinery, however, was built for a smaller program and must be reorganized to meet its growing responsibilities. With the aid of last year's excellent ""capacity study"" ,  the program is now preparing to put the necessary reforms into effect. In planning our future contributions to this important program we in the United States will give major weight to the progress actually achieved m undertaking these reforms.",UNGD
USA,1970,"46.	In recent years people all over the world have suddenly awakened to the inexorable and tragic fact that excessive population growth can, if continued much longer, frustrate all our hopes for peace, justice and progress. There can be no progress for the majority of mankind if population growth outstrips all available means of development. There can be no justice for the majority of mankind where population expands faster than production and social services. There can be no peace for the majority of mankind where progress and justice are unattainable because of unrestrained population growth.",UNGD
USA,1970,"47.	This is not a problem confined to either developed or developing countries. In my own country, although our growth rate has recently slowed to about 1 per cent a year, we have adopted as a national goal the availability within five years of family planning services to every citizen.",UNGD
USA,1970,"48.	Clearly, the need is equally urgent in many nations striving for development whose annual population growth in some cases approaches 4 per cent which means a doubling of the number of people in less than twenty- years. The care and feeding of such enormous numbers of dependent children, their upbringing in conditions compatible with human dignity, could constitute such a burden as to nullify progress in economic development and to cause living standards to remain at past low levels or even to fall lower.",UNGD
USA,1970,"49.	The United States is convinced that the vigorous pursuit of family planning policies is an indispensable element in the strategy of development. In this conviction we have pledged this year $7.5 million to the recently established United Nations Fund for Population Activities, whose services to requesting Governments are rapidly growing.",UNGD
USA,1970,"50.	In the context of development I wish also to emphasize the enormous potential of the world's deep seabeds, whose exploitation is just now beginning to come within the reach of our technology.",UNGD
USA,1970,"51.	Last May President Nixon, in a farreaching announcement concerning the oceans, proposed that an international regime be established by treaty for the exploitation of seabed resources beyond the depth of 200 meters. He further proposed that this regime ""should provide for the collection of substantial mineral royalties to be used for international community purposes, particularly economic assistance to developing countries"". Early in August the United States circulated in the United Nations seabed Committee  a draft convention [A18021, annex V], embodying these and other important proposals in the President's announcement.",UNGD
USA,1970,"52.	These proposals, if carried out, will amount to a new departure in the history of nations. Never in history has the exploitation of resources of such great potential value been placed under the supervision and regulation of an effective international authority. Never in history has assurance been offered that the international community could have a substantial, independent source of revenue to be equitably divided to serve the interests of mankind as a whole.",UNGD
USA,1970,"53.	The United States hopes that the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly will advance this important enterprise so that a sound and workable international seabed regime, backed up by effective machinery, can come into being as soon as possible. To this end it is important that States refrain from making further claims to jurisdiction over the seabeds or over the waters of the oceans. We believe that a conference on subjects related to the law of the sea, including seabeds, should be called as soon as practicable and that preparatory steps should be initiated by this session of the General Assembly.",UNGD
USA,1970,"54.	I come now to an issue of critical and rapidly growing importance the protection of the human environment. Development and protection of the environment are not mutually contradictory; indeed, they must go hand in hand if the world is to be a fit place in which to live. The United Nations is in a key position to foster the necessary cooperation so that the needs of the environment, as well as those of development, receive the energetic attention they require.",UNGD
USA,1970,55.	Already the plans for the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in 1972 have begun to take shape and have helped to focus the attention of United Nations Member Governments on this worldwide challenge; but we should not wait for the Stockholm Conference before launching necessary initiatives.,UNGD
USA,1970,"56.	Therefore the United States urges that all of us here, representing both developed and developing countries, work together to enable the United Nations to take the following steps. Firstly, it should identify those environmental problems, especially those pollutants in the atmosphere and the oceans, which are or may be dangerous on a global scale. Second, it should make plans for a coordinated world monitoring network to keep track of these environmental dangers. This network should build on existing programs, particularly those of the agencies of the United Nations family, and should use the most advanced data processing and satellite technology, such as the earth resource survey satellites which my country has been developing. Third, it should collect and analyze the suggestions of governments concerning environmental guidelines for States, both developed and developing, as well as for international institutions engaged in development programs. Fourth, it should explore the possibility of establishing international air and water quality standards. The United States hopes the Assembly at this session will act to advance those important objectives.",UNGD
USA,1970,"51. A newly acute problem which threatens a growing number of societies is the epidemic spread of addiction to dangerous drugs, especially among young people. This phenomenon has mushroomed in a very few years, not only in my own country but in a number of others, both developed and developing. It creates untold misery, violence, lawlessness and economic and human loss.This menace must be stopped. To do so it will be necessary to reinforce existing international agreements and to strengthen the longstanding and excellent work of agencies in this field, especially those of the United Nations. We are glad to note that the Commission on Narcotic Drugs is meeting now to deal with the whole range of problems involved, from the poppy field through the international syndicate to the needle in the vein. My Government hopes that an adequate action program will emerge from this process and will command the energetic support of the community of nations. The United States has already offered, subject to Congressional approval, a contribution of $2 million to such a program.",UNGD
USA,1970,"58.	Finally, it is important that we make better use of the talents of young people in international service, especially the service of the United Nations. Many delegations to this session, including that of the United States, contain youthful members as suggested by the General Assembly a year ago. That is entirely fitting, because the fate of the United Nations and indeed of world peace will soon be in their hands.",UNGD
USA,1970,"59.	With that in mind President Nixon, in his address to this Assembly a year ago [1755th meeting], pledged the enthusiastic support of the United States for Iran's proposal to establish an international volunteer service corps [see 1695th meeting, para. 75], to work in the cause of development and to be recruited on an individual basis from the people, principally young people, of many countries. We hope that proposal will be given final approval in the current session. We hope also that the United Nations will seek new ways to encourage able young people to find careers in its Secretariat and those of the other agencies of the United Nations family.",UNGD
USA,1970,"60.	In these remarks I have discussed only a few of the major tasks facing the United Nations in the years ahead. Even those, however, are enough tc make it obvious that, if we indeed address ourselves to such tasks, the effectiveness of this Organization will be tested more severely than ever. To meet this test we shall have to be far more attentive than has been our habit to many matters of structure, organization and procedure. For example, I would mention the following.",UNGD
USA,1970,"61.	In considering applications for membership by very small States, we must make sure that they are not only willing but also, as the Charter stipulates, able to carry out the Charter's obligations. As the SecretaryGeneral has for years pointed out, many Territories now moving towards independence are too small, either in population or in resources or both, to carry out the minimum obligations which membership requires. Yet these very small entities need more than most the assistance that the United Nations system can provide. Where the burden of membership would be excessive, we should provide a form of association with the United Nations which would enable such States to enjoy the benefits without the burdens of the system.",UNGD
USA,1970,"62.	The persistence of the United Nations financial deficit undermines confidence in the Organization, threatens its capabilities in many fields and casts a cloud over its future. The United States welcomes the SecretaryGeneral's recent call for ""a concerted effort to restore the financial solvency of the Organization"". We hope that he will himself take a lead in such an effort, in which we shall certainly play our part.",UNGD
USA,1970,"63.	In the annual choice of non-permanent members of the Security Council, it would be well that, as the Charter requires, due regard be specially paid, in the first instance, to the prospective member's contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security, rather than merely to rotation among the members of geographic groups.",UNGD
USA,1970,"64.	The primary consideration in selecting individuals for posts in the Secretariat, above all for senior posts, should be fully to meet the Charter's ""paramount consideration"" namely ""the highest standards of efficiency, competence, and integrity"".",UNGD
USA,1970,"65.	We must at long last take decisive steps to streamline the excessively time-consuming organization and procedures of the General Assembly, as Canada has wisely proposed, or else we shall either ""drown in a sea of words"" or suffocate under an avalanche of paper.",UNGD
USA,1970,66.	We must take more effective measures to ensure that the entire United Nations system is so organized and managed that it responds efficiently to the directives of its governing organs and to the priority needs of the world. That will require much better administrative and budgetary coordination and control than we have yet achieved.,UNGD
USA,1970,"67.	The United States offers these suggestions in the spirit of the twenty-fifth anniversary session, which we understand to be a spirit of sober determination to make this Organization more effective, to make its future more responsive than its past to the imperative needs of men, women and children everywhere. Many other delegations have offered or will offer their proposals in the same spirit. The test of our seriousness and our success will be how much of this agenda of objectives we can begin to carry out.",UNGD
USA,1970,"68.	We are assembled from the four corners of the earth. The interests of the Governments we speak for often seem to be and sometimes are in contradiction. But by our presence here, by our commitment to the United Nations and its Charter, we have acknowledged that we also have interests in common, interests in peace, justice and progress, interests in the continued habitability of our planet, common interests which we are at last beginning to recognize are inescapable and overriding.",UNGD
USA,1970,"69.	The question now is, do we have the wit not only to perceive these common interests in some vague rhetorical way, but also to act upon them together realistically and decisively even at the cost sometimes of older and narrower interests? If we do not do so, history may sweep aside not only this Organization but also the nations that compose it.",UNGD
USA,1970,"70.	The SecretaryGeneral has said that we may have only ten years left to cope effectively with the problems of our times before they become so staggering as to be beyond our capacities. As we enter the Disarmament Decade and the Second Development Decade, let us keep that warning foremost in our minds and let us be determined to act together to avert catastrophe.",UNGD

USA,1971," Mr. President, I should like first of all to associate myself with the previous speakers who have congratulated you on your election to the high office of President of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly. The United States is confident that you will pursue the ideals of the Charter with the same dedication as your distinguished predecessors.",UNGD
USA,1971,,UNGD
USA,1971,2.	The United Nations is an important instrument of peace. It is also the repository of many of the world's hopes. We must ensure that it is true to those hopes; that we here assembled-the representatives of 130 nations- meet our high responsibilities not only to our own world but to the world of the future.,UNGD
USA,1971,"3.	Building a structure of peace-a structure that will stand-requires patience, dedication and realism. Working at peace working at it seriously means more than long hours of careful deliberation. It means putting aside preconceptions; it means weighing carefully what our real interests are, not only as citizens of our own countries, but also as citizens of the world. It means proceeding with urgency, but without impatience; steadfastly, but not stubbornly. And it means recognizing that differences exist, and will continue to exist-differences of view, differences of interests, different systems and different values-and that one of the functions of a structure of peace is to protect and accommodate those differences, not to destroy them.",UNGD
USA,1971,"4.	It is appropriate, I think, to take note of the fact that, by any objective standard, the world is a more peaceful place than it was just a few years ago.",UNGD
USA,1971,"5.	In Africa;, the conflict in Nigeria is now long over. Because of recent developments, prospects in the Far East seem more hopeful. Fighting in Indo-China, though it continues, has been substantially reduced. The cease-fire still holds in the Middle East. The division of Europe is less",UNGD

USA,1971,"threatening because the first stage of agreement has been reached on Berlin. Concrete agreements have been achieved on the periphery of the arms race, and encouraging progress is being made at its center.",UNGD
USA,1971,"6.	Yet there are areas-above all, in South Asia where political instability has tipped the balance toward greater tension. There, man's ancient, enemies-poverty, hunger and disease-gain headway, nurturing within themselves seeds of further unrest. And even in areas where recent progress has been made, tensions remain, and the threat of renewed or increased hostilities continues.",UNGD
USA,1971,"7.	That is why we must accelerate our efforts for peace. The achievement of a peaceful world will depend, not just, on the efforts of a handful of powers, but on the efforts of all Governments.",UNGD
USA,1971,"8.	In recent years we have seen a new diversification of power and influence among the nations of the world. Most colonial States have won their independence and now exert a marked impact on world affairs. Japan has found remarkable new strength. The movement towards cohesion in Western Europe has quickened. This diversified and interdependent world is clearly preferable to the bipolar world which emerged from the Second World War. Nevertheless, relations between the Soviet Union and the United States-both large, continental States, both nuclear States and both dynamic States-are of fundamental importance.",UNGD
USA,1971,9.	Nothing could better serve the cause of peace than a further relaxation of tension between our two countries and the elimination of its by-product-the arms race.,UNGD
USA,1971,"10.	The foreseeable future cannot, of course, be expected to bring an end to the differences between the Soviet and United States political systems or to the competition between us. But it can bring important and beneficial changes in our relations. Many agreements have been achieved in recent years between us. The success of those agreements has stimulated the effort to negotiate still others. Collectively they could promote not just ""coexistence"" but-if we proceed to build on durable foundations ""co-operation"" as well.",UNGD
USA,1971,"11.	Our desire to lay the foundations for such cooperation is in no way lessened by our policy of seeking to improve relations with the People's Republic of China. And we have taken due note of the Soviet Foreign Minister's statement that the Soviet Union regards the normalization or our relations with the People's Republic of China as a ""natural development"".",UNGD
USA,1971,12.	Though efforts at improvement in Soviet-United States and in Soviet-European relations have assumed many ,UNGD
USA,1971,"forms, the two most important have been the negotiations on strategic arms and on Berlin.",UNGD
USA,1971,"13.	A Berlin agreement will be a milestone along the road to a more peaceful and co-operative Europe. Pivotal in the portion already agreed to is the firm commitment to unrestricted transit traffic of civilian persons and goods between the Federal Republic of Germany and West Berlin. Particularly significant is the obligation the Soviet Union has undertaken to ensure that this traffic will be unimpeded, that it will be facilitated and that it will receive preferential treatment.",UNGD
USA,1971,"14.	The value of this agreement will depend, not on how the obligations have been formulated on paper, but on how they will be carried out on the ground. Truly unhindered movement to and from Berlin would greatly reduce tensions and remove one of Europe's most dangerous flash-points. Half-hearted or grudging implementation of the agreement would only perpetuate fears and suspicions, The willingness of the German Democratic Republic, in its discussions with the Federal Republic of Germany, to translate general obligations into specific commitments and subsequently to put those commitments into actual practice will be the crucial test.",UNGD
USA,1971,"15.	The achievement of a final Berlin agreement and its effective implementation could lead to broader progress. It would, for example, make more realistic the prospects of a European conference with United States and Canadian participation. It would accelerate the movement desired by the people of Eastern as well as of Western Europe-- towards the reduction of tensions on the continent.",UNGD
USA,1971,16.	It is to this end that the United States is pursuing the possibilities of negotiation on a mutual and balanced reduction of military forces in Europe.,UNGD
USA,1971,"17.	Two years ago President Nixon pledged to the General Assembly that the United States was determined to limit, and then reverse, the build-up of strategic arms. He said we intended to conduct our negotiations with the Soviet Union ""soberly and seriously... seeking to reach agreements rather than to make propaganda"" [1755th meeting, para. 69J.",UNGD
USA,1971,"18.	In May of this year the United States and the Soviet Union announced their intention to achieve agreement on both defensive and offensive strategic arms, initiating a new stage of intensive work. As a result, although no agreement has yet been reached, we have come closer together on the concepts and details of an agreement to limit anti-ballistic missile systems. On 20 May we made an announcement that contemplates that agreements to limit defensive and offensive weapons will be reached ""together"". When talks resume in Vienna next month it is therefore agreed that discussions in greater detail will be undertaken on the limitation of offensive weapons.",UNGD
USA,1971,"19.	Meanwhile, these negotiations have already produced two valuable agreements, one on preventing nuclear accidents from leading to war and the other on improving ""hot line"" communications between Washington and Moscow by use of satellites,",UNGD
USA,1971,"20.	There has also been encouraging movement in multi-lateral negotiations. Here, too, the United States intends to work constructively for further concrete results. In particular, we urge this session of the General Assembly to seek broad ratification of the draft convention on the prohibition of the development, production and stockpiling of bacteriological (biological) and toxin weapons and their destruction [A/8457-DC/234, annex A],",UNGD
USA,1971,"21.	The Soviet Union has suggested the creation of a periodic world disarmament conference to be established outside the United Nations [1942nd meeting, paras. 158' 159J. Frankly, we are skeptical that such a generalized approach would produce specific accomplishments. All post-war experience indicates that a concrete, step-by-step approach offers better prospects for success than more grandiose schemes, which tend to generate many words but few results.",UNGD
USA,1971,"22.	At a time when the prospects are promising for participation in the United Nations by the People's Republic of China, and perhaps others as well, there would seem to be no reason for establishing still more world disarmament machinery outside the United Nations framework.",UNGD
USA,1971,"23.	Accommodations among the stronger nations of the World are vital elements of a lasting peace. But the road to enduring peace is no short cut, passing only through the capitals of the strong. The road to peace must traverse every region where there are human beings who aspire to a better condition of life.",UNGD
USA,1971,"24.	In Africa, where the right to a freer existence is still denied to many, we are constant in our support of practical and peaceful means to achieve self-determination and end racial discrimination. That is the policy which President Nixon and I were pleased to confirm to the President of Mauritania and the distinguished delegation from the Organization of African Unity in Washington last week. Consistent with that objective ve have decided to accept the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the legal consequences for States of South Africa's continuing occupation of Namibia. .",UNGD
USA,1971,"25.	In South-East Asia, as we proceed with an orderly military withdrawal from Viet-Nam, we will continue to make substantial efforts to aid the region's economic progress.",UNGD
USA,1971,"26.	In this hemisphere, we are moving towards a relation-ship of equal partnership in which rights and responsibilities are shared. We are conscious that such a relationship requires economic growth, greater opportunities for trade, and closer economic co-operation among us.",UNGD
USA,1971,"27.	I especially wish to emphasize our undiminished concern for the economic health of the nations of Latin America and other nations of the developing world at a time when the new economic policy of the United States may have raised certain questions,",UNGD
USA,1971,"28.	Our objectives have not changed. We are not adopting a policy of economic nationalism. We have not abandoned our efforts to assist developing countries-through trade, through aid and through investment. Our faith in a free and open system of economic relations among States has not diminished.",UNGD
USA,1971,"29.	We seek a stronger economy at home. We seek also a more equitable international economic system which meets present-day conditions and thus gives even greater encouragement to the flow of goods and capital across borders. Such a system would contribute to the prosperity of all the world's people, in developing and developed countries alike.",UNGD
USA,1971,"30.	This Organization, during this session, faces a decision on the China question-a decision with major consequences for the United Nations.",UNGD
USA,1971,"31.	In our interdependent world, no significant segment of the world's population and of the world's power should be isolated. It was this consideration which led President Nixon to alter the China policy of the United States. To pursue a policy which did not respond to present realities would risk the future for the sake of the past . On the other hand, to seek to improve relations with the People's Republic of China, and to contribute to its greater contact with the international community, could foster prospects for a stable peace in years to come.",UNGD
USA,1971,"32.	Thus, President Nixon began over two years ago, unilaterally and at first without response, to improve bilateral relations. Recently, he resolved to move decisively into a new era of relations by accepting an invitation to visit Peking before 1 May 1972. And he decided to support the seating of the People's Republic of China in the General Assembly and as a permanent member of the Security Council.",UNGD
USA,1971,"33.	The United States wants to see the People's Republic of China come to the Assembly, take its seat, and participate. We want to see it assume, as a permanent member of the Security Council, the rights and responsibilities which go with that status. On the seating of the People's Republic of China there is widespread agreement in this body.",UNGD
USA,1971,"34.	This Assembly does, however, face a related and momentous issue. It could become the first Assembly in United Nations history to take action to expel a Member -an action which would have the effect of expelling 14 million people from its councils. The path of expulsion is perilous. To open it for one would be to open it for many.",UNGD
USA,1971,"35.	So the United States and 16 other countries have introduced a draft resolution [A/L.633] which would seat the People's Republic of China as a permanent member of the Security Council, while providing representation both for it and for the Republic of China in the General Assembly. That resolution is based on political reality and on basic equity.",UNGD
USA,1971,36.	It is only realistic to recognize a factual situation which has persisted for more than 20 years: that two Governments now exercise authority over territory and over people who were given representation in the United Nations when China ratified the Charter in 1945 as an original Member.,UNGD
USA,1971,37.	It is only realistic that all the Chinese people who were once represented there should again be represented and represented by those who actually govern them.,UNGD
USA,1971,"38.	It is only realistic that the Security Council seat should be filled by the People's Republic of China, which exercises control over the largest number of people of all the world's Governments.",UNGD
USA,1971,"39.	It would be unrealistic to expel from this body the Republic of China, which governs a population of Taiwan larger than the populations of two 'thirds of the 130 United Nations Members.",UNGD
USA,1971,"40.	Further, it would be unjust to expel a Member which has participated for over 25 years in the world of this Organization with unfailing devotion to the principles set forth in the Charter.",UNGD
USA,1971,41.	The proposal that both the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China should be represented in the United Nations should commend itself to Member States of varying national policies.,UNGD
USA,1971,42.	It would assure that the long-prevailing de facto situation in China is reflected in United Nations representation; but it does not ask Member States to alter their recognition policies or their bilateral relations.,UNGD
USA,1971,"43.	It would provide representation for the people concerned by those who actually govern them; but it does not divide China into two separate States; after all, we all know that Byelorussia and the Ukraine are not separate States.",UNGD
USA,1971,"44.	The dual representation draft resolution is founded on the reality of the current situation; but it does not seek to freeze that situation for the future, as it expressly provides that the present decision is without prejudice to a future settlement.",UNGD
USA,1971,"45.	In short, the dual representation draft resolution asks simply, and only, that the United Nations take account of the situation as it exists today, and give all the people of China representation in this Organization. As the Charter has accommodated practical solutions of other unusual situations in the past,, so it is flexible enough to accommodate the realities of this one.",UNGD
USA,1971,"46.	The other proposal before this Assembly the draft resolution advanced by A'bania and others [AjL.630 and Add. 1 ] -is punitive in substance and in intent. It does not seek to deal with facts, but to excoriate and condemn. Its essence is not to admit the People's Republic of China, but to expel the Republic of China and to expel it ""forthwith"". That draft resolution would exacerbate, not harmonize, relations in Asia. And it would weaken, not strengthen, the moral and political fiber of this Organization.",UNGD
USA,1971,"47.	The issue, then, before this body is the issue of expulsion. That is why we have proposed a draft resolution, which we refer to as the ""important question draft resolution"" but which more properly should be referred to as the ""non-expulsion draft resolution"" [AjL.632]. This draft resolution requires a two-thirds vote to expel a present Member of the United Nations. It is consistent with the letter and the spirit of the Charter,",UNGD
USA,1971,"48.	Some Members have argued that, whatever the equities and realism of our proposal to maintain the representation of the Republic of China, it should not be supported because they feel that the People's Republic of China would refuse to take its seat. Such predictions are hazardous. Certainly the People's Republic of China may be expected to oppose the proposal so long as there is any possibility for a draft resolution that meets its maximum demands. But just as certainly, after a General Assembly decision providing the People's Republic of China with the status of a permanent member of, and with a seat on, the Security Council but not expelling the Republic of China, a new situation would exist. In any event, I submit, in deciding how to vote we should look more to what the United Nations should do.",UNGD
USA,1971,"49.	It is ironic that, just as the sentiment for universality in the Assembly is growing, many of those who have long extolled it now seek to violate it. If the United Nations is to. embrace universality-as some have suggested then surely the admission of one Member should not be accompanied by the expulsion of another.",UNGD
USA,1971,"50.	Our task here, it seems to me, must be to make a decision that is reasonable, that accepts the realities of the existing situation, that does not prejudice the ultimate outcome and that provides for representation of all the people concerned. Thereafter, our efforts should be to convince those directly involved to take advantage of the decision we have made. The cause of peace has been greatly benefited in recent years by greater pragmatism in many capitals. It would be served by the same pragmatism on this issue.",UNGD
USA,1971,"51.	As the United Nations becomes a more universal body it will be better able to deal with the lengthening list of global issues confronting it: in conciliating political differences, in reducing the world's armaments, in curbing the epidemic spread of narcotics addiction, in protecting the environment, in assuring the exploitation of the oceans for the benefit of mankind.",UNGD
USA,1971,52.	In meeting those responsibilities the United Nations must during this session deal with two important matters.,UNGD
USA,1971,"53.	It must choose an outstanding successor to our most able and distinguished Secretary-General, UThant, to whose dedication and idealism we all pay a tribute. And, as I pay respects to the Secretary-General, I am sure my colleagues will understand if I also single out for special attention two United States citizens who are now retiring -Paul Hoffman, the Administrator of the United Nations Development Program, who has devoted himself so effectively to the economic welfare of the developing countries, and Ralph Bunche, Under-Secretary-General for Special Political Affairs, and a Nobel Prize winner, who has contributed so markedly to the cause of peace.",UNGD
USA,1971,"54.	The Assembly must also arrest the continuing deterioration of the United Nations financial position, which, as the Secretary-General has pointed out [A/8401/Add.lJ, has eroded its fiscal credit and undermined confidence in its potential. Responsibility for halting that decline rests primarily on those who fail to pay their share. Given assurances of adequate contributions by others, the United States will be prepared to assist towards an over-all solution. Meanwhile we find it hard to understand why the membership should continue to recommend and approve budget increases beyond those necessary to meet inescapable cost increases.",UNGD
USA,1971,55.	In two parts of the world in which the United Nations has been particularly active-South Asia and the Middle East urgent progress is needed.,UNGD
USA,1971,"56.	In South Asia, renewed and more widespread violence is an ever-present possibility. The events in East Pakistan are internal events with which the Government and people of Pakistan must deal. But their consequences the flight of refugees into India, the danger of famine, the threat to peace in South Asia-are of grave concern to all nations.",UNGD
USA,1971,57.	To restore peaceful conditions and to save human lives it is clear that restraint must be exercised in the subcontinent; that the international assistance Program must be expanded to avert famine and to create conditions to encourage the return of refugees; and that efforts towards an effective political settlement in East Pakistan must be actively pursued. We are working to those ends.,UNGD
USA,1971,"58.	The United States strongly supports the efforts of the United Nations to organize an effective international relief Program. We have made available over $200 million for relief in bast Pakistan and for emergency assistance for the refugees in India-well over 50 per cent of the total contributions from all foreign contributors, public and private. Last week, President Nixon asked Congress to appropriate an additional $250 million to sustain a high level of relief assistance. A much wider response from other countries is clearly required. We urge the major powers and others with substantial financial resources to contribute generously.",UNGD
USA,1971,59.	The other place where progress is urgently required is the Middle East. Over several years the United Nations has made determined and persistent efforts to achieve a lasting peace in that critical area. None the less the opportunities for success and the risks of failure remain in precarious balance.,UNGD
USA,1971,"60.	Security Council resolution 242 (1967), establishing the principles for a durable peace, was the first major step towards reason after 18 years of belligerency and a fragile, often violated, armistice.",UNGD
USA,1971,"61.	The cease-fire along the Suez Canal, now nearing its fifteenth month, was the second major step away from war.",UNGD
USA,1971,62.	It is time for a third major step towards peace.,UNGD
USA,1971,"63.	For four years Ambassador Jarring has worked diligently to secure the agreement called for in Security Council resolution 242 (1967). We support his efforts. We believe his mission remains the best path to an over-all settlement and to lasting peace. Our views on such a final peace settlement remain those expressed in President Nixon's foreign policy report earlier this year and in my statement of 9 December 1969,",UNGD
USA,1971,64.	Both sides to the conflict are committed to the fundamental and reciprocal principles to which the Jarring mission is dedicated: living in peace with each other and withdrawal from territories occupied in the 1967 conflict as set forth in Security Council resolution 242 (1967). Despite those commitments a deep gulf ot suspicion and distrust remains.,UNGD
USA,1971,65.	Each side is convinced of the justice of its cause. Each is concerned about its future security. A political settlement based on mutual accommodation could assure both. An attempt to achieve these ends by force will destroy all possibilities for either.,UNGD
USA,1971,66.	That is why we believe a third major step towards peace is essential -a step that can be taken now; a step that is practical; a step that could help create the confidence and trust which are now lacking; a step towards full and complete implementation of resolution 242 (1967).,UNGD
USA,1971,"67.	That step is an interim Suez Canal agreement. That is why the United States has welcomed the interest of both Egypt and Israel in such an agreement. That is why, at the request of the parties, the United States has undertaken to play a constructive role in the process of arriving at an agreement.",UNGD
USA,1971,"68.	In order to explore the positions of each side, we have discussed concrete and specific ideas designed to meet the legitimate needs and concerns of both sides. Those ideas, given willingness and good intentions on both sides, could become the basis for a breakthrough. They require further quiet discussions with the parties, an undertaking we now hope can be expedited along the following lines.",UNGD
USA,1971,69.	A first point is the relationship between an interim agreement and an over-all settlement. A fair approach should be founded on two basic principles:,UNGD
USA,1971,"-That a Suez Canal agreement is merely a step towards complete and full implementation of resolution 242 (1967) within a reasonable period of time, and not an end in itself-that has to be clearly established in any agreement; also",UNGD
USA,1971,"-That neither side can realistically expect \to achieve, as part of an interim agreement, complete agreement on the terms and conditions of an over-all settlement -if it could, there would be no necessity for an interim agreement.",UNGD
USA,1971,"Those final terms and conditions will have to be worked out through negotiations under Ambassador Jarring's auspices. And we would hope that if an interim agreement was reached, active negotiations under Ambassador Jarring's auspices could be renewed.",UNGD
USA,1971,"70.	A second point is the matter of the cease-fire. Its maintenance is in the interest of all of us, of everyone concerned, of everyone in this room, in fact in the interest of the whole world. The ultimate objective, of course, is a permanent end to belligerency, as part of a final, binding peace agreement. But such a commitment is not realizable in the context of an interim agreement. Neither would a cease-fire of short duration be realistic. With goodwill on both sides, it should be possible to find common under-standing between the parties on this issue.",UNGD
USA,1971,"71.	Third is the zone of withdrawal. There are, of course, very important strategic considerations involved in this key point. However, based on our discussions, we believe it should be possible to meet the principal concerns of both sides. Without going into the details, I would merely say that I believe that in the long run the most significant aspect of an interim agreement might prove to be that it established the principle of withdrawal looking to an over-all settlement as a fact rather than as a theory.",UNGD
USA,1971,72.	Fourth is the nature of the supervisory arrangements. Both sides must have confidence that the agreement will not be violated and that adequate machinery will be provided for prompt detection of any infractions. We are confident that ways reassuring to both Israel and Egypt can be found for altering and strengthening the supervisory mechanisms that have existed in the area for the past two decades.,UNGD
USA,1971,"73.	Fifth is the question of an Egyptian presence east of the Suez Canal. The reopening and operation of the Suez Canal would require Egyptian personnel east of the Canal. It is understandable, too, that normal activities should be pursued in as much of the zone evacuated as possible. The question of an Egyptian military presence east of the Canal is one on which the parties hold opposite views. But here too, based on our discussion, we believe that there are possibilities for compromise on this issue.",UNGD
USA,1971,"74.	Sixth is the use of the Suez Canal. The United States has long held that the Canal should be open to passage for all nations, without discrimination. This principle is clear in Security Council resolution 242 (1967). What is at present at issue in considering an interim agreement is principally the timing at which this right could be exercised. We believe an accommodation on this point is quite possible.",UNGD
USA,1971,"75.	With those six points in mind, let me say this: because the parties have asked us, we intend to continue our determined effort to assist them in arriving at an interim agreement. This effort, we believe, is imperative because  and I think it is important to keep this in mind there is no more realistic and hopeful alternative to pursue.",UNGD
USA,1971,"76.	There are risks to peace: but the greater risk is inaction, unwillingness to face up to the hard decisions. A practical step now-an interim agreement-would make the next step toward peace less difficult for all the parties to take. It would restore the use of the Suez Canal as a waterway for international shipping. It would re-establish Egypt's authority over a major national asset. It would separate the combatants. It would produce the first Israeli withdrawal. It would extend the cease-fire. It would diminish the risk of major-power involvement. It would be an important step toward the complete implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967).",UNGD
USA,1971,"77.	I submit that the logic for such an agreement is overwhelming. If the leaders of the area would grasp this opportunity, they would give new hope to their peoples for tranquility, for progress and for peace.",UNGD
USA,1971,"78.	In all of our efforts, both in the United Nations and elsewhere, we should recall that nothing we do matters so much as the legacy we leave to those who follow, the bridge that we build between the past and the future. There is a tendency, especially when tensions are high and tempers short, to regard the present as the focal point of all of man's history. But ours is only the latest generation, not the last generation; and nothing we leave to future generations will matter so much as a structure of enduring peace.",UNGD
USA,1971,"79.	Peace must be achieved and maintained, not by the decree of a few, but by accommodation among many. Each Government, in upholding its people's particular interests, must also advance the world interest in a peace which will endure.",UNGD
USA,1971,"80.	To that interest the United Nations, from its creation, has been dedicated.",UNGD
USA,1971,81.	To that interest the United States pledges anew its best efforts.,UNGD
USA,1971,,UNGD
USA,1971,,UNGD
USA,1971,,UNGD
USA,1972,During the past few years the world has made remarkable advances toward the Charter goal of practicing tolerance and living together in peace with one another as good neighbors.,UNGD
USA,1972,"45.	In 1972 alone, the United States and the Soviet Union have undertaken with each other to do their utmost to avoid military confrontations, to respect the sovereign equality of all countries and to promote conditions in which no country would be subject to outside interference in its internal affairs. The Soviet Union and the United States have also placed precise limitations on our defensive and, at least for the next five years, on our offensive strategic missile systems. The United States and the People's Republic of China have undertaken to broaden the understanding between our peoples, to improve relations between us in the conviction that this would be in the interests of all States, and to oppose any efforts to establish hegemony in Asia or toward division of the world into spheres of influence. The United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union and the United States have agreed on specific provisions to ensure unimpeded movement to and from Berlin by road, rail and waterways. The Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic have opened negotiations on a treaty to normalize their relations. And North and South Korea have intensified their talks on the plight of divided families and have agreed to establish a joint committee to examine problems of unification.",UNGD
USA,1972,"46.	There have been many other accomplishments in pursuance of the Charter's objectives in 1972. I mention these merely to illustrate how old patterns of hostility are being eroded. If continued, this process will in time find positive reflection within the United Nations itself.",UNGD
USA,1972,"47.	We are encouraged, too, by calls in both Eastern and Western capitals for a more secure and open Europe. A step toward realizing this goal would be the creation of a more stable military balance in central Europe through negotiation of mutual and balanced force reductions. We are currently in consultation with our allies, and we believe exploratory talks on this subject could begin within the next several months. We trust they will be productive.",UNGD
USA,1972,"48.	It is equally important to move toward more normal relationships in Europe relationships which have not existed since the end of the Second World War. Toward this objective, a conference on security and co-operation in Europe, if it is carefully and constructively prepared, could play a crucial role. A conference whose over-all effect was to put a stamp of approval upon the rigid divisions of Europe would only prolong the problems of today into yet another generation. On the other hand, a conference which promoted a more normal relationship among all of Europe's States and peoples would reinforce the trend toward better ",UNGD
USA,1972,"relations on other levels. That is why we believe that the conference must take practical steps to promote the freer movement of people, ideas and goods across the breadth of the continent.",UNGD
USA,1972,"49.	We are also now studying alternative approaches for the forthcoming Strategic Arms Limitation Talks. The United States will pursue the following general aims. First, our endeavor will be to negotiate on offensive weapons. In so doing we shall seek to expand the scope of strategic offensive weapons included in the limitations and to establish an equitable balance in the major delivery systems. Second, we shall wish to examine carefully qualitative limitations which could enhance stability. Third, we will aim to reduce levels of strategic arms. As President Nixon said to this General Assembly in 1969, our objective is "".. . not only to limit the build-up of strategic arms, but to reverse it.""",UNGD
USA,1972,"50.	Of course we also attach importance to the work of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament, which has now turned its attention to preventing the accumulation of chemical weapons for use in warfare. Work in that Committee has come a long way towards resolving some of the important and complex issues related to possible significant restraints in this area. The United States is intensifying its study of all proposals and we look forward to responding to them at an early date.",UNGD
USA,1972,51.	It is clear from what I have said that the United States believes that a practical step-by-step approach is the best way to achieve genuine progress m disarmament.,UNGD
USA,1972,52.	Let me take note of other areas in the world in which progress needs to be accelerated.,UNGD
USA,1972,"53.	In Africa, this Assembly must continue to champion the efforts of all peoples of all races to secure human dignity, self-determination and social justice. The United States will continue to lend its full support to all practical efforts to those ends.",UNGD
USA,1972,"54.	In Latin America, while growth rates in recent years have far exceeded Alliance for Progress targets, economic development is still a primary concern and a primary need. The United States Government remains committed to a substantial program of economic assistance, particularly through regional organizations. And, in recognition of the importance of trade to development, we are actively supporting the participation of Latin American and other developing countries in the coming negotiations on a new international monetary system.",UNGD
USA,1972,"55.	In Viet-Nam the United States has reduced its armed forces from about 550,000 to 35,000. President Nixon has proposed a cease-fire in all of IndoChina under international supervision, an exchange of prisoners of war, and a total withdrawal of United States forces. Under this proposal the political future of Viet-Nam could be negotiated by the VietNamese themselves. President Nixon has also pledged a major effort to assist both VietNamese States in post-war reconstruction. In such circumstances it is hard to understand why the other side persists in believing that the war should be continued.  ",UNGD
USA,1972, ,UNGD
USA,1972,"56.	And in the Middle East, the momentum towards a peace settlement must be regained. We should take note of two positive elements. First, the cease-fire is now in its twenty-sixth month. Second, the climate for a settlement seemed to improve very much as 1972 progressed. We must, however, recognize that the Munich killings have set off deplorable patterns of action and reaction and I emphasize that the United States believes that both action and reaction are deplorable-and that these patterns have seriously clouded the prospects for early progress. Nevertheless, neither side has permanently closed the door to future diplomatic efforts. We believe that the forces favoring a peaceful settlement still have the upper hand. Our task in this Assembly, our task individually as representatives of nations, is to do everything possible to see that the forces that favor a peaceful settlement are supported.",UNGD
USA,1972,"57.	The ""no war, no peace"" situation which prevails now in the Middle East does not and will not serve the interest of anyone in the area. Certainly a stable, just and durable peace agreement based on Security Council resolution 242 (1967) continues to be the objective of the United States. But this, we believe, cannot be achieved without the beginning of a genuine negotiating process between the parties concerned. No settlement imposed from the outside can long endure. Negotiation is not capitulation. Negotiating activity among long-standing antagonists across the world is occurring at present. Why should the Middle East be an exception? When North Korea can talk to South Korea, when East Germans can talk to West Germans, when Indians and Pakistanis can meet in the immediate aftermath of war and prior to the withdrawal of troops, then surely the Middle East should be no exception to the general rule that differences should be reconciled through an active dialog between the parties concerned.",UNGD
USA,1972,58.	Let me hasten to add that we do not hold that the process need necessarily begin through direct negotiations. We understand that other diplomatic avenues exist. Ambassador Jarring remains available to help the parties negotiate the terms of a peace settlement in accordance with Security Council resolution 242 (1967).,UNGD
USA,1972,"59.	Another-and in our view the most promising-first step would be proximity talks leading to an interim Suez Canal agreement. What would such an agreement do? It would separate the combatants, restore to Egypt operation of and authority over the Suez Canal, involve some Israeli withdrawal, preserve the cease-fire, and provide momentum for further efforts towards an over-all settlement.",UNGD
USA,1972,"60.	It is encouraging that both sides agree that such an interim agreement would be not an end in itself but rather the first step towards an over-all peace settlement. Such a practical test of peace on the ground would be in the interests of both sides, and the United States remains prepared to assist in achieving it, if that would be helpful to the parties. Moreover, an over-all settlement in accordance with Security Council resolution 242 (1967) must meet the legitimate aspirations and concerns of the Governments on both sides as well as of the Palestinian people.",UNGD
USA,1972,"61.	In considering some of the great political developments of the past few years, one cannot help but observe as the Brazilian Foreign Minister has just done- that the United Nations has not been directly involved. This fact has often been cited in attacks against it.",UNGD
USA,1972,"62.	We are all aware, of course, that the Charter does not intend the United Nations to be the center of all diplomacy. Still, as the Secretary-General puts it temperately in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization, . . in the political sphere the Organization's place is . . . uncertain"" [A/8701/Add.l, p. 1]. With that thought most of us would agree.",UNGD
USA,1972,"63.	As we look to the future, it is well to keep in mind that it is not so much in institutional reforms-and we are certainly not opposed to such reforms-as in national wills that the solutions to the problems must be sought. The future of this body, the future of the United Nations, depends on national wills, on the ability of nations to work together, accommodating themselves to each other's problems, if you will. Yet to the extent that better work methods and more realistic institutional arrangements will help, we also must bring them about.",UNGD
USA,1972,"64.	For example, we believe that for the Security Council to maintain its influence and authority, ways must be found to ensure the representation of States, other than the present permanent members and I am speaking about States whose resources and influence are of major importance in world affairs. The absence of Japan, for example, is notable in a body designed to engage the responsibilities of the world's principal Powers.",UNGD
USA,1972,"65.	We believe in greater recourse to fact-finding commissions, to good offices and to quiet preventive diplomacy.",UNGD
USA,1972,"66.	We believe that the increase in bloc voting, often without independent regard for the merits of the issue, is leading increasingly to unrealistic results.",UNGD
USA,1972,67.	The discussion of the United Nations weaknesses in dealing with political problems has reached its peak just at a time when its contribution to economic development and scientific and technological co-operation is making great strides.,UNGD
USA,1972,"68.	Long before economic development became a major matter of international concern, the United Nations initiated efforts to reduce the economic gap between developed and developing countries. From the start the United States has supported that effort. It is an encouraging fact that during each of the last three years the per capita growth in production has finally achieved a higher rate in the less developed than in the developed world. Still, as the recent World Bank report showed, there are serious problems of income distribution, high rates of infant mortality, low rates of literacy, serious malnutrition and widespread ill health.  The United States intends to continue to devote serious efforts to solving such problems through the improved United Nations Development Program, and through other channels of economic assistance. ",UNGD
USA,1972,69.	United Nations activities related to science and technology are also having an impact.,UNGD
USA,1972,"70.	The landmark United Nations Conference on the Human Environment has proposed a world monitoring of levels of pollution in water, air, earth and living beings, measuring levels of specific chemicals, such as hydrocarbons which poison the air of the world's cities. To launch this and other important programs without delay, we urge this Assembly to establish the secretariat and the proposed $100 million fund for the environment.",UNGD
USA,1972,"71.	The United Nations can also make a substantial contribution in the fight against drug traffic, particularly heroin traffic. A revised Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs will give the International Narcotics Control Board authority to reduce poppy cultivation and opium production in countries shown to be sources of that traffic. The United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control is helping States to improve their drug administrations, to train police and customs officials, to develop other means of livelihood for opium farmers, and to prevent and treat drug addiction. As President Nixon said last week, “Every Government which wants to move against narcotics should know that it can count on our country for our wholehearted support and assistance in doing so'.",UNGD
USA,1972,"72.	Just last week the Secretary-General announced that 1974 will be the World Population Year and the time, of a major United Nations population conference. It is our hope that the conference will lead to the setting of concrete goals of reduced population growth.",UNGD
USA,1972,73.	The General Assembly at this session will review the progress of its sea-bed Committee? in preparing for a conference on the law of the sea [item 36]. It is important for us to use this opportunity to help make the oceans an example of international co-operation rather than an area of future conflict.,UNGD
USA,1972,"74.	Such activities as pollution, narcotics, the sea-bed and population control-most of them connected with new applications of science and technology will increase in importance in the future. We believe that they must acquire a greater focus and priority in the United Nations.",UNGD
USA,1972,"75.	I have spoken today about some of the United Nations weaknesses as well as some of its strengths because I believe we must look at this Organization realistically so that we may contribute to its future prospects. In that spirit, the United States will continue to support the United Nations. We remain committed to making it stronger and more effective.",UNGD
USA,1972,"76.	During this session the United Nations will have an opportunity and an obligation to take action of vital importance to the international community. The United Nations must deal effectively with criminal acts of international terrorism which have so tragically touched the lives of people everywhere, without warning, without discrimination, without regard for the sanctity of human life. ",UNGD
USA,1972,"77.	Twenty-four years ago the United Nations, in its Universal Declaration of Human Rights, affirmed that every human being has the right to 'life, liberty, and the security of person'. Yet what is happening in the world today to that security?",UNGD
USA,1972,"78.	In Sweden, 90 people boarding an international flight are held hostage and held for ransom by Croatian terrorists.",UNGD
USA,1972,79.	In London an Israeli diplomat is killed by a bomb sent through the mail. In New York colleagues in the United Nations narrowly avert a similar fate.,UNGD

USA,1972,"85.	In this year alone 25 airliners from 13 countries have been successfully hijacked, and 26 other attempts have been frustrated. In this year alone 140 airplane passengers and crew have been killed-140 have been killed-and 97 wounded in acts of terrorism. In five years 27 diplomats from 11 countries have been kidnapped and three assassinated. In New York, Arab and other missions have been threatened with violence.",UNGD
USA,1972,"86.	Is there anyone here in this Assembly who has not had the occasion, as he has journeyed by plane from around the globe, to be concerned about his own personal safety? Is there any one of you here who has not wondered what terrorist might strike next, or where he might strike?",UNGD
USA,1972,"87.	The issue is not an issue of war-not war between States, not civil war or revolutionary war. The issue is not the strivings of people to achieve self-determination and independence. Rather, it is whether millions of air travelers can continue to fly in safety each year. It is whether a person who opens his mail can open it without fear of being blown up. It is whether diplomats can safely carry out their duties. It is whether international meetings, like the Olympics, like this General Assembly, can proceed without the ever-present threat of violence. In short, the issue is whether the vulnerable lines of international communications the airways and the mails, diplomatic discourse and international meetings can continue, without occupation, to bring nations and peoples together. All who have a stake in this have a stake in decisive action to suppress these demented acts of terrorism.",UNGD
USA,1972,"88.	We are all aware that, aside from the psychotic and the purely felonious, many criminal acts of terrorism derive from political origins. We all recognize that issues such as self-determination must continue to be addressed seriously by the international community. But political passion, however deeply held, cannot be a justification for criminal violence against innocent persons. Certainly the terrorist acts I have cited are totally unacceptable attacks against the very fabric of international order. They must be universally condemned, whether we consider the cause the terrorists invoke noble or ignoble, legitimate or illegitimate.",UNGD
USA,1972,89.	We must take effective steps to prevent the hijacking of international civil aircraft.,UNGD
USA,1972,90.	We must take effective steps to prevent murderous attacks and the kidnapping of diplomats.,UNGD
USA,1972,"91.	We must take effective steps to prevent terrorists from sending bombs through the mails, or murdering innocent civilians. Just a few hours ago, I am pleased to note, the International Criminal Police Organization [INTERPOL], by a vote of 58 to none, condemned such acts and decided to gear up its machinery to help cope with this very difficult problem.",UNGD
USA,1972,"92.	The United States welcomes the initiative the Secretary-General has taken to place this matter on the agenda [A/8791 and Add.l]. Two years ago, before the problem had reached its present dimensions, the General Assembly took the first step, the step that must guide us now. In the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations [resolution 2625 (XXV), annex], which so strongly-keep this in mind reaffirmed the right of self-determination, the General Assembly also unanimously declared that each nation has a duty to refrain from assisting or in any way participating in",UNGD
USA,1972,"""... terrorist acts in another State or acquiescing in organized activities within its territory directed towards the commission of such acts...""",UNGD
USA,1972,"93.	The time has come to make that obligation, which this General Assembly solemnly undertook, more specific and more meaningful. In the past two years the international community has taken certain steps in the field of hijacking. Conventions have been concluded prescribing severe penalties for the hijacking and sabotage of aircraft and requiring States to extradite or prosecute hijackers and saboteurs. We urge all States which have not ratified these conventions to do so.",UNGD
USA,1972,"94.	We are now faced with an urgent need to deter and punish international crimes of violence not only in the air but throughout our societies. The United States urges this Assembly to act, and act at once, to meet this challenge.",UNGD
USA,1972,"95.	First, the draft treaty to prosecute or extradite those who attack or kidnap diplomats or officials of foreign governments or international organizations should be completed and opened for signature at this session of the Assembly. The draft articles on the prevention and punishment of crimes against diplomatic agents and other internationally protected persons are already before the Assembly in the report of the International Law Commission [A/8710/Rev.l, chap. II, sect. C]. ",UNGD
USA,1972,"96.	Second, a treaty providing for suspension of all air service to countries which fail to punish or extradite hijackers or saboteurs of civil aircraft should be promptly completed and opened for signature. We repeat that such a treaty should provide for the suspension of all air service to countries which fail to prosecute or extradite hijackers or saboteurs of civil aircraft. It is our view that a nation which provides a safe haven for hijackers should be outlawed by the international community. A draft of a treaty to do this has already been considered by a sub-committee of the International Civil Aviation Organization. To achieve early action, the process of deliberation should be accelerated and a diplomatic conference to complete the treaty should be called without delay.",UNGD
USA,1972,"97.	Third, a new treaty on the export of international terrorism should be concluded and opened for signature as soon as possible. It should include universal condemnation of, and require the prosecution or extradition of, persons who kill, seriously injure or kidnap innocent civilians in a foreign State for the purpose of harming or forcing concessions from a State or from an international organization. To complete such a treaty, we believe a diplomatic conference should be convened as soon as possible. The United States Government is today circulating the first draft of such a treaty.  We urge all governments to give it their earnest consideration. We refer to this as a first draft, because we are sure that many suggestions for changes will be made. We are perfectly flexible on the form of the treaty, but we think this is a subject that deserves our earnest attention.",UNGD
USA,1972,98.	We have also embodied these various proposals in a draft resolution which we submitted to the Secretariat this morning for distribution. ,UNGD
USA,1972,"99.	These actions would mark a major advance in the struggle against international terrorism. Surely, it is in the collective interest of every nation represented in this hall to arrest the growing assault on international order with which we are all faced. Let this General Assembly be the driving force for the specific and vigorous steps that are required. Let it prove that the United Nations can meet this test. Let it show people everywhere that this Organization, here, now, is capable of the concrete action necessary to bring us closer to a world free of violence-the kind of world which is the great goal of the United Nations Charter.",UNGD
USA,1973,"35.	I should like to add my congratulations to those so well expressed by the Minister for External Relations of Brazil to our new President, Ambassador Benites of Ecuador, whose long experience at the United Nations and his many contributions to international law and to the inter-American system all ensure that this twenty-eighth session of the Assembly will have outstanding leadership.",UNGD
USA,1973,36.	I come before you today  —  confirmed in office but two days ago  —  as probably the world's most junior Foreign Minister. That President Nixon should ask me as my first official act to speak here for the United States reaffirms the importance that my country attaches to the values and the ideals of the United Nations.,UNGD
USA,1973,"37.	It would be idle to deny that the American people, like many others, have sometimes been disappointed because this Organization has not been more successful in translating its architects' hopes for universal peace into concrete accomplishments.",UNGD
USA,1973,"38.	But, despite our disappointments, my country remains committed to the goal of a world community. We will continue to work in this Parliament of Man to make it a reality.",UNGD
USA,1973,"39.	Two centuries ago, the philosopher Kant predicted that perpetual peace would come eventually — either as the creation of man's moral aspirations or as the consequence of physical necessity. What seemed Utopian then looms as tomorrow's reality; soon there will be no alternative. Our only choice is whether the world envisaged in the Charter will come about as the result of our vision or of a catastrophe invited by our short-sightedness.",UNGD
USA,1973,"40.	The United States has made its choice. My country seeks true peace, not simply an armistice. We strive for a world in which the rule of law governs and fundamental human rights are the birthright of all. Beyond the bilateral diplomacy, the pragmatic agreements and dramatic steps of recent years, we envisage a comprehensive, institutionalized peace encompassing all nations, large and small, a peace which this Organization is uniquely situated to foster and to anchor in the hearts of men. This will be the spirit of American foreign policy. This attitude will guide our work in this Organization.",UNGD
USA,1973,41.	We start from a bedrock of solid progress. Many of the crises that haunted past sessions of the General Assembly have been put behind us. Agreement has been reached on Berlin; there is a cease-fire in the Middle East; the VietNam war has been ended. The rigid confrontation that has dominated international life and weakened this Organization for a quarter of a century has been softened.,UNGD
USA,1973,42.	The United States and the Soviet Union have perceived a commonality of interests in avoiding nuclear holocaust and in establishing a broad web of constructive relationships. Talks on stretegic arms limitation have already produced historic accords aimed at slowing the arms race and ensuring strategic stability; we have today resumed negotiations on this subject. The positive results we hope for will enhance the security of all mankind.,UNGD
USA,1973,43.	Two decades of estrangement between the United States and the People's Republic of China have given way to constructive dialogue and productive exchanges. President Nixon has met with the leaders of that great nation; we have agreed to a historic communique  that honestly sets forth both our differences and our common principles; and we have each opened a liaison office in the capital of the other.,UNGD
USA,1973,"44.	Many other countries have seized the initiative and contributed, in substance and spirit, to the relaxation of tensions. The nations of Europe and North America are engaged in a conference to further security and cooperation. The two German States have taken their place in this Assembly. India, Pakistan and Bangladesh have begun to move towards a welcome reconciliation. North and South Korea are at last engaged in a dialogue which, we hope, will lead to a new era of peace and security between them.",UNGD
USA,1973,"45.	Yet these achievements, solid as they are, have only made less precarious the dangers and divisions inherited from the post-war era. We have ended many of the confrontations of the cold war; yet, even in this room, the vocabulary of suspicion persists. Relaxation of tensions is justified by some as merely a practical interlude before renewed struggle. Others suspect the emergence of a two- Power condominium. And as tension between the two original blocs has eased, a third grouping increasingly assumes the characteristics of a bloc of its own — the alignment of the non-aligned.",UNGD
USA,1973,"46.	So the world is uneasily suspended between old slogans and new realities, between a view of peace as but a pause in an unending struggle and a vision of peace as a promise of global co-operation.",UNGD
USA,1973,"47.	In 1946 James Byrnes, the first Secretary of State to address this Assembly, spoke of how the United Nations could ""help to break down habits of thinking in national isolation and go far to bring about understanding and tolerance."" ",UNGD
USA,1973,"48.	The United States will never be satisfied with a world of uneasy truces, of offsetting blocs, of accommodations of convenience. We know that power can enforce a resigned passivity, but only a sense of justice can enlist consensus. We strive for a peace whose stability rests not merely on a balance of forces, but on shared aspirations. We are convinced that a structure which ignores humane values will prove cold and empty and unfulfilling to most of mankind.",UNGD
USA,1973,"49.	The United States deeply believes that justice cannot be confined by national frontiers; that truth is universal, and not the peculiar possession of a single people or group or ideology; that compassion and humanity must ennoble all our endeavours.",UNGD
USA,1973,"50.	In this spirit we ask this Assembly to move with us from detente among the big Powers to co-operation among all nations, from coexistence to community.",UNGD
USA,1973,"51.	Our journey must begin with the world as it is and with the issues now before us. The United States will spare no effort to ease tensions further and to move towards greater stability. We shall continue, in the spirit of the Shanghai communique, our search for a new relationship with the People's Republic of China. We shall work to promote positive trends elsewhere in Asia. The uncertain peace in Indo-China must be strenghened; the world community cannot afford, or permit, a relapse into war in that region. We shall continue to pursue vigorously the building of constructive relationships with the Soviet Union. We shall strive to promote conciliation in Europe. In the negotiations beginning next month we shall seek a reduction of the military forces that have faced each other for so long across that divided continent. We shall give new vigour to our policy of partnership in the Western hemisphere. We shall honour our pledge to promote self- determination, economic development and human dignity across the continent of Africa. We shall press on with strategic arms limitations talks. We consider them crucial for security and stability in this period. We shall search for solutions to the world-wide problem of conventional weapons, which drain our resources and fuel the fires of local conflict.",UNGD
USA,1973,52.	In all these efforts the United States will be guided by certain fundamental principles.,UNGD
USA,1973,53.	We have no desire for domination. We will oppose — as we have consistently opposed throughout this century — any nation that chooses this path. We have not been asked to participate in a condominium; we would reject such an appeal if it were made.,UNGD
USA,1973,54.	We will never abandon our allies or our friends. The strengthening of our traditional ties is the essential foundation for the development of new relationships with old adversaries.,UNGD
USA,1973,55.	We will work for peace through the United Nations as well as through bilateral relationships.,UNGD
USA,1973,"56.	We recognize our special obligation, as a permanent member of the Security Council, to assist in the search for just solutions in those parts of the world now torn by strife, such as the Middle East. While we cannot substitute for the efforts of those most directly involved, we are prepared to use our influence to generate a spirit of accommodation and to urge the parties towards practical progress.",UNGD
USA,1973,"57.	But progress on the traditional agenda is not enough. The more we succeed in solving political problems, the more other and perhaps deeper challenges emerge. As the world grows more stable we must confront the question of the ends of detente. As the threat of war recedes, the problem of the quality of life takes on more urgent significance.",UNGD
USA,1973,"58.	We are, in fact, members of a community drawn by modern science, technology and new forms of communication into a proximity for which we are still politically unprepared. Technology daily outstrips the ability of our institutions to cope with its fruits. Our political imagination must catch up with our scientific vision. This is at the same time the greatest challenge and the greatest opportunity of this Organization.",UNGD
USA,1973,"59.	The pollution of the skies, the seas and the land is a global problem.",UNGD
USA,1973,60.	The increased consumption of cereals has reduced world food reserves to dangerously low levels.,UNGD
USA,1973,"61.	The demand for energy is outrunning supply, and the need for technological innovation is urgent.",UNGD
USA,1973,62.	The growth of the world's economy is inhibited by restrictive trading blocs and an insufficiently flexible international monetary system.,UNGD
USA,1973,"63.	The exploitation of the resources of the ocean beds, which is essential for the needs of burgeoning populations, requires global co-operation lest it degenerate into global contention.",UNGD
USA,1973,64.	Challenges of this magnitude cannot be solved by a world fragmented into self-contained nation States or rigid blocs.,UNGD
USA,1973,"65.	I do not intend, today, to cover the whole agenda of international co-operation. Rather, I shall speak briefly of some illustrative areas for common action. I pledge the readiness of the United States to solve these problems co-operatively and to submit proposals Jmed at their resolution.",UNGD
USA,1973,"66.	First, a world community requires the curbing of conflicts. The United Nations, in its 28-year history, has not always been idle in this sphere. In Indonesia, the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East, the Congo, and Cyprus, it has shown its ability for effective fact-finding, mediation and peace-keeping missions. This central aspect of the United Nations work must be strengthened. On a small planet, so bound together by technology and so interdependent economically, we can no longer afford the constant eruption of conflict and the danger of its spread.",UNGD
USA,1973,"67.	Yet, in recent years, we have found ourselves locked in fruitless debates about the inauguration of peace-keeping operations and over the degree of control the Security Council would exercise over peace-keeping machinery — an impasse which has ensured that permanent peace-keeping machinery would not come into being. Each peace-keeping unit we have formed has been an improvisation growing out of argument and controversy.",UNGD
USA,1973,"68.	We should delay no longer. The time has come to agree on peace-keeping guidelines so that this Organization can act swiftly, confidently and effectively in future crises. To break the deadlock, the United States is prepared to consider how the Security Council can play a more central role in the conduct of peace-keeping operations. If- all countries concerned approach this problem with a desire to achieve a co-operative solution, the United Nations can achieve a major step forward during this session.",UNGD
USA,1973,"69.	Secondly, a world community must have the widest possible membership. The exclusion of any qualified State denies representation not only to Governments, but to peoples. Membership in this body should be a step towards reconciliation, not a source of conflict. The time has come for North and South Korea to be offered their rightful place here without prejudice to a future evolution towards unification. In this spirit also, we support the permanent membership of Japan in the Security Council.",UNGD
USA,1973,"70.	Thirdly, a world community must assure that all its people are fed. The growing threat to the world's food supply deserves the urgent attention of this Assembly. Since 1969, global consumption of cereals has risen more rapidly than production; stocks are at the lowest levels in years. We now face the prospect that, even with bumper crops, the world may not rebuild its seriously depleted reserves in this decade.",UNGD
USA,1973,71.	No one country can cope with this problem. The United States therefore proposes that a world food conference should be organized under United Nations auspices in 1974 to discuss ways to maintain adequate food supplies and to harness the efforts of all nations to meet the hunger and malnutrition resulting from natural disasters and that nations in a position to do so offer technical assistance in the conservation of food. The United States is ready to join with others in providing such assistance.,UNGD
USA,1973,"72.	Fourthly, a world community cannot remain divided between the permanently rich and the permanently poor. Let us therefore resolve that this Assembly, this year, initiate a search, drawing on the world's best minds, for new and imaginative solutions to the problems of development. Our search must be candid and realistic, but it must also be free of peremptory demands, antagonistic propositions, ideological confrontation, or propagandistic rhetoric, or we will surely fail.",UNGD
USA,1973,"73.	The United States is prepared to join this new search, providing freely of the experience gained over two decades. We have learned not to exaggerate our capacity to transform nations, but we have also learned much about what progress is possible. We will participate without pre-conditions, with a conciliatory attitude and a co-operative commitment. We ask only that others adopt the same approach.",UNGD
USA,1973,"74.	In this spirit, the United States is willing to examine seriously the proposal by the distinguished President of Mexico for a charter of the economic rights and duties of States."" Such a document will make a significant and historic contribution if it reflects the true aspirations of all nations; it will accomplish nothing if it is turned into an indictment of one group of countries by another. To command general support, and to be implemented, the proposed rights and duties must be defined equitably and take into account the concerns of industrialized as well as of developing countries. The United States stands ready to define its responsibilities in a humane and co-operative spirit.",UNGD
USA,1973,"75.	Fifthly, a world community must harness science and technology for the benefit of all. We must begin to match our remarkable technological skills with our equally remarkable technological needs. We must find the means for the co-operative and judicious development of energy resources. We must responsibly confront the problems of population growth, which are fast pushing humanity towards the limits of what our earth can sustain. We must embark on a new scientific revolution to increase agricultural productivity in all lands. No field of human endeavour is so dependent upon an open world for its advancement, no field is so in need of international co-operation to cope with its potential dangers.",UNGD
USA,1973,76.	Are we prepared to accept the imperatives of a global society and infuse our labours with new vision? Or shall we content ourselves with a temporary pause in the turmoil that has racked our century? Shall we proceed with one-sided demands and sterile confrontation? Or shall we proceed in a spirit of compromise produced by a sense of common destiny? We are convinced that we must move from hesitant co-operation born of necessity to genuine collective effort based on common purpose.,UNGD
USA,1973,"77.	It is a choice no country can make alone. We can repeat old slogans or strive for new hope. We can fill the record of our proceedings with acrimony, or we can dedicate ourselves to dealing with man's deepest needs. The ideal of a world community may be decried as unrealistic, but great constructions have always been ideals before they can become realities. Let us therefore dedicate ourselves to this noblest of all possible goals and achieve at last what has so long eluded us: true understanding and tolerance among mankind.",UNGD
USA,1974,"Last year, at the previous session [.2124th meeting], in my first address as Secretary of State, I spoke to this Assembly about American purposes. I said that the United States seeks a comprehensive, institutionalized peace, not an armistice. I asked other nations to join us in moving the world from detente to cooperation, from coexistence to community.",UNGD
USA,1974,41.	In the year that has passed some progress has been made in dealing with particular crises. But many fundamental issues persist and new issues threaten the very structure of world stability.,UNGD
USA,1974,42.	Our deepest problem going far beyond the items on the agenda is whether our vision can keep pace with our challenges. Will history recall the twentieth century as a time of mounting global conflict or as the beginning of a global conception? Will our age of interdependence spur joint progress or common disaster?,UNGD
USA,1974,"43.	The answer is not yet clear. New realities have not yet overcome old patterns of thought and action. Traditional concepts of national sovereignty, social struggle and the relation between the old and the new nations too often guide our course. And so we have managed but not advanced; we have endured but not prospered; and we have continued the luxury of political contention.",UNGD
USA,1974,44.	This condition has been dramatized in the brief period since the twenty-eighth session. War has ravaged the Middle East and Cyprus. The technology of nuclear explosives has resumed its dangerous spread. Inflation and the threat of global decline hang over the economies of rich and poor alike.,UNGD
USA,1974,"45.	We cannot permit this trend to continue. Conflict between nations once devastated continents; the struggle between blocs may destroy humanity, ideologies and doctrines drawn from the last century do not even address, let alone solve, the unprecedented problems of today. As a result, events challenge habits; a gulf grows between rhetoric and reality.",UNGD
USA,1974,"46.	The world has dealt with local conflicts as if they were perpetually manageable. We have permitted too many of the underlying causes to fester unattended, until the parties believed that their only recourse was war. And because each crisis ultimately has been contained we have remained complacent. But tolerance of local conflict tempts world holocaust. We have no guarantee that some local crisis perhaps the next will not explode beyond control.",UNGD
USA,1974,"47.	The world has dealt with nuclear weapons as if restraint were automatic. Their very awesomeness has chained those weapons for almost three decades; their sophistication and expense have helped to keep constant for a decade the number of States which possess them. Now, as was quite foreseeable, political inhibitions are in danger of crumbling. Nuclear catastrophe looms more plausible, whether through design or miscalculation, accident, theft or blackmail.",UNGD
USA,1974,"48.	The world has dealt with the economy as if its constant advance were inexorable. While postwar growth has been uneven and some parts of the world have lagged, our attention has been focused on how to increase participation in a general advance. We continue to deal with economic issues on a national, regional or bloc basis at the precise moment that our interdependence is multiplying. Strains on the fabric and institutions of the world economy threaten to engulf us all in a general depression.",UNGD
USA,1974,"49.	The delicate structure of international cooperation, so laboriously constructed over the last quarter century, can hardly survive, and certainly cannot be strengthened, if it is continually subjected to the shocks of political conflict, war and economic crisis.",UNGD
USA,1974,"50.	The time has come, then, for the nations assembled here to act together in the recognition that continued reliance on old slogans and traditional rivalries will lead us towards a world ever more torn between rich and poor. East and West, producer and consumer; a world where local crises threaten global confrontation and where the spreading atom threatens global peril; a world of rising costs and dwindling supplies, of growing populations and declining production.",UNGD
USA,1974,"51.	There is another course. Last week before this Assembly [2234th meeting] President Ford dedicated our country to a cooperative,, open approach to build a more secure and more prosperous world. The United States will assume the obligations that our values and strength impose upon us. But the building of a cooperative world is beyond the grasp of any one nation. An interdependent world requires not merely the resources but the vision and creativity of us all. Nations cannot simultaneously confront and cooperate with one another.",UNGD
USA,1974,"52.	We must recognize that the common interest is the only valid test of the national interest. It is in the common interest, and thus in the interest of each nation, that local conflicts be resolved short of force and 'heir root causes be removed by political means; that the spread of nuclear technology be achieved without the spread of nuclear weapons; that growing economic interdependence lift all nations and not drag them down together.",UNGD
USA,1974,"53.	We will not solve these problems during this session, or during any one session, of the General Assembly, but we must at least begin to remedy problems, not just manage them; to shape events, rather that endure them; to confront our challenges instead of one another.",UNGD
USA,1974,"54.	The urgent political responsibility of our era is to resolve conflicts without war. History is replete with examples of the tragedy that sweeps nations when ancient enmities and the inertia of habit freeze the scope for decision. Equally, history is marked by brief moments when an old order is giving way to a pattern new and unforeseen. Those are times of potential disorder and danger but also of opportunity for fresh creation.",UNGD
USA,1974,"55.	We face such a moment today. Together let us face its realities. First, a certain momentum towards peace has been created, in EastWest relations and in certain regional conflicts. It must be maintained. But we are only at the beginning of the process. If we do not continue to advance, we will slip back. Second, progress in the negotiation of difficult issues comes only through patience, perseverance and a recognition of the tolerable limits of the other side. Peace is a process, not a condition. It can be reached only in steps. Third, the failure to recognize and grasp the attainable will prevent the achievement of the ideal. Attempts to resolve all issues at one time are a certain prescription for stagnation. Progress towards peace can be thwarted by asking too much as surely as by asking too little. Fourth, the world community can help resolve chronic conflicts, but exaggerated expectations will prevent essential accommodation among the parties. This Assembly can help or hinder the negotiating process. It can seek a scapegoat or a solution. It can offer the parties an excuse to escape reality or sturdy support in search of a compromise. It can decide on propaganda or contribute to realistic approaches responsive to man's yearning for peace.",UNGD
USA,1974,"56.	The Middle East starkly demonstrates those considerations. In the past year we have witnessed both the fourth ArabIsraeli war in a generation and the hopeful beginnings of a political process towards a lasting and just peace. We have achieved the respite of a ceasefire and two disengagement agreements, but the shadow of war remains. The legacy of hatred and suffering, the sense of irreconcilability have begun to yield however haltingly to the process of negotiation. But we still have a long road ahead.",UNGD
USA,1974,"57.	One side seeks the recovery of territory and justice for a displaced people. The other side seeks security and recognition by its neighbors of its legitimacy as a nation. In the end, the common goal of peace surely is broad enough to embrace all these aspirations.",UNGD
USA,1974,58.	Let us be realistic about what must be done. The art of negotiation is to set goals that can be achieved at a given time and to reach them with determination. Each step forward modifies old perceptions and brings about a new situation that improves the chances of a comprehensive settlement.,UNGD
USA,1974,"59.	Because these principles were followed in the Middle East, agreements have been reached in the past year which many thought impossible. They were achieved, above all, because of the wisdom of the leaders of the Middle East who decided that there had been enough stalemate and war, that more might be gained by testing each other in negotiation than by testing each other on the battlefield.",UNGD
USA,1974,"60.	The Members of this body, both collectively and individually, have a solemn responsibility to encourage and support the parties in the Middle East on their present course. We have as well an obligation to give our support to the United Nations peacekeeping forces in the Middle East and elsewhere. The United States applauds their indispensable role, as well as the outstanding contribution of SecretaryGeneral Waldheim in the cause of peace.",UNGD
USA,1974,61.	During the past year my country has made a major effort to promote peace in the Middle East. President Ford has asked me to reaffirm today that we are determined to press forward with these efforts. We will work closely with the parties and we will cooperate with all interested countries within the framework of the Geneve Conference.,UNGD
USA,1974,"62.	The tormented island of Cyprus is another area where peace requires a spirit of compromise, accommodation and justice. The United States is convinced that the sovereignty, political independence, and territorial integrity of Cyprus must be maintained. It will be up to the parties to decide on the form of government they believe best suited to the particular conditions of Cyprus. They must reach accommodation on the areas to be administered by the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities as well as on the conditions under which refugees can return to their homes and reside in safety. Finally, no lasting peace is possible unless provisions are agreed upon which will lead to the timely and phased reduction of armed forces and armaments and other war material.",UNGD
USA,1974,"63.	The United States is prepared to play an even more active role now than in the past in helping the parties find a solution to the centuries old problem of Cyprus. We will do all we can, but it is those most directly concerned whose effort is most crucial. Third parties should not be asked to produce miraculous outcomes not anchored in reality. Third parties can encourage those directly involved to perceive their broader interests; they can assist in the search for elements of agreement by interpreting each side's views and motives to the other. But no mediator can succeed unless the parties genuinely want mediation and are ready to make the difficult decisions needed for a settlement.",UNGD
USA,1974,"64.	The United States is already making a major contribution to help relieve the human suffering of the people of Cyprus. We urge the international community to continue and, if possible, to increase its own humanitarian relief effort.",UNGD
USA,1974,65.	The United States notes with particular satisfaction the continuing process of change in Africa. We welcome the positive demonstration of cooperation between old rulers and the new free. The United States shares and pledges its support for the aspiration of Africans to participate in the fruits of freedom and human dignity.,UNGD
USA,1974,66.	The second new dimension on our agenda concerns the problem of nuclear proliferation.,UNGD
USA,1974,67.	The world has grown so accustomed to the existence of nuclear weapons that it assumes they will never be used. But today technology is rapidly expanding the number of nuclear weapons in the hands of major Powers and threatens to put nuclear explosive technology at the disposal of. an increasing number of other countries.,UNGD
USA,1974,"68.	In a world where many nations possess nuclear weapons, dangers would be vastly compounded. It would be infinitely more difficult, if not impossible, to maintain stability among a large number of nuclear Powers. Local wars would take on a new dimension. Nuclear weapons would be introduced into regions where political conflict remains intense and the parties consider their vital interests overwhelmingly involved. There would, as well, be a vastly heightened risk of direct involvement by the major nuclear Powers.",UNGD
USA,1974,"69.	This problem does not concern one country, one region, or one bloc alone. No nation can be indifferent to the spread of nuclear technology; every nation's security is directly affected.",UNGD
USA,1974,70.	The challenge before the world is to realize the peaceful benefits of nuclear technology without contributing to the growth of nuclear weapons or to the number of States possessing them.,UNGD
USA,1974,"71.	As a major nuclear Power, the United States recognizes its special responsibility. We realize that we cannot expect others to show restraint if we do not ourselves practice restraint. Together with the Soviet Union we are seeking to negotiate new quantitative and qualitative limitations on strategic arms. Last week our delegations reconvened in Geneva, and we intend to pursue these negotiations with the seriousness of purpose they deserve. The United States has no higher priority than controlling and reducing the levels of nuclear arms.",UNGD
USA,1974,72.	Beyond the relations of the nuclear Powers to each other lies the need to curb the spread of nuclear explosives. We must take into account that plutonium is an essential ingredient of nuclear explosives and that in the immediate future the amount of plutonium generated by peaceful nuclear reactors will be multiplied many times. Heretofore the United States and a number of other countries have widely supplied nuclear fuels and other nuclear materials in order to promote the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. This policy cannot continue if it leads to the proliferation of nuclear explosives. Sales of these materials can no longer be treated by anyone as a purely commercial competitive enterprise.,UNGD
USA,1974,"73.	The world community, therefore, must work urgently towards a system of effective international safeguards against the diversion of plutonium or its byproducts. The United States is prepared to join with others in a comprehensive effort.",UNGD
USA,1974,"74.	Let us together agree on the practical steps which must be taken to assure the benefits of nuclear energy free of its terrors. The United States will shortly offer specific proposals to strengthen safeguards to the other principal supplier countries. We shall intensify our efforts to gain the broadest possible acceptance of IAEA safeguards, to establish practical controls on the transfer of nuclear materials, and to ensure the effectiveness of these procedures. The United States will urge IAEA to draft an international convention for enhancing physical security against theft or diversion of nuclear material. Such a convention should set forth specific standards and techniques for protecting materials while in use, storage arid transfer. The Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex], which this Assembly has endorsed, warrants continuing support. The Treaty contains not only a broad commitment to limit the spread of nuclear explosives but specific obligations to accept and implement IAEA safeguards and to control the transfer of nuclear materials.",UNGD
USA,1974,"75.	Whatever advantages seem to accrue from the acquisition of nuclear explosive technology will prove to be ephemeral. When Pandora's box has been opened, no country will be the beneficiary and all mankind will have lost. This is not inevitable.",UNGD
USA,1974,"If we act decisively now, we can still control the future.",UNGD
USA,1974,76.	Let me now turn to our economic problems.,UNGD
USA,1974,77.	Lord Keynes wrote:,UNGD
USA,1974,"""The power to become habituated to his surroundings is a marked characteristic of mankind. Very few of us realize with conviction the intensely unusual, unstable, complicated, unreliable, temporary nature of the economic organization.""",UNGD
USA,1974,"78.	The economic history of the postwar period has been one of sustained growth, for developing as well as developed nations. The universal expectation of our peoples, the foundation of our political institutions and the assumption underlying the evolving structure of peace are all based on the belief that this growth will continue.",UNGD
USA,1974,"79.	But will it? The increasingly open and cooperation global economic system that we have come to take tor granted is now under unprecedented attack. The world is poised on the brink of a return to the unrestrained economic nationalism which accompanied the collapse of economic order in the 1930s. And, should that occur, all would suffer: poor as well as rich, producer as well as consumer.",UNGD
USA,1974,80.	So let us so longer fear to confront in public the facts which have come to dominate bur private discussions and concerns.,UNGD
USA,1974,81.	The early warning signs of a major economic crisis are evident. Rates of inflation unprecedented in the past quarter century are sweeping developing and developed nations alike. The world's financial institutions are staggering under the most massive and rapid movements of reserves in history. And profound questions have arisen about meeting man's most fundamental needs for energy and food.,UNGD
USA,1974,"82.	While the present situation threatens every individual and nation, it is the poor who suffer the most. While the wealthier adjust their living standards, the poor see the hopes of a lifetime collapse around them. While others tighten their belts, the poor starve. While others can hope for a better future, the poor see only despair ahead.",UNGD
USA,1974,"83.	It can be in the interest of no country or group of countries to base policies on a test of strength, for a policy of confrontation would end in disaster for ail. Meeting man's basic needs for energy and food and assuring economic growth while mastering inflation require international cooperation to an unprecedented degree.",UNGD
USA,1974,84.	Let us apply these principles first to the energy situation. Oil producers seek a better life for their peoples and a just return for their diminishing resources. The developing nations less well endowed by nature face the disintegration of the results of decades of striving for development as the result of a price policy over which they have no control. The developed nations find the industrial civilization built over centuries in jeopardy.,UNGD
USA,1974,85.	Both producers and consumers have legitimate claims. The problem is to reconcile them for the common good. ,UNGD
USA,1974,86.	The United States is working closely with several oil producers to help diversify their economies. We have established commissions to facilitate the transfer of technology and to assist with industrialization. We are prepared to accept substantial investments in the United States and we welcome a greater role for the oil producers in the management of international economic institutions.,UNGD
USA,1974,"87.	The investment of surplus oil revenues presents a great challenge. The countries which most need these revenues are generally the least likely to receive them. The world's financial institutions have coped thus far, but ways must be found to assure assistance for those countries most in need of it. And the full brunt of the surplus revenues is yet to come.",UNGD
USA,1974,"88.	Despite our best efforts to meet the oil producers' legitimate needs and to channel their resources into constructive uses, the world cannot sustain even the present level of prices, much less continuing increases. The prices of other commodities will inevitably rise in a never-ending inflationary spiral. Nobody will benefit. The oil producers will be forced to spend more for their own imports. Many nations will not be able to withstand the pace, and the poorer could be overwhelmed. The complex, fragile structure of global economic cooperation required to sustain national economic growth stands in danger of being shattered.",UNGD
USA,1974,89.	The United States will work with other consumer nations on means of conservation and on ways to cushion the impact of massive investments from abroad. The preliminary agreement on a program of solidarity and cooperation signed a few days ago in Brussels by the major consumer countries is an encouraging first step.,UNGD
USA,1974,"90.	But the long range solution requires a new understanding between consumers and producers. Unlike food prices, the high cost of oil is not the result of economic factors, of an actual shortage of capacity or of the free play of supply and demand. Rather it is caused by deliberate decisions to restrict production and maintain an artificial price level. We recognize that the producers should have a fair share; the fact remains that the present price level even threatens the economic wellbeing of producers. Ultimately they depend upon the vitality of the world economy for the security of their markets and their investments. And it cannot be in the interest of any nation to magnify the despair of the least developed, which are uniquely vulnerable to exorbitant prices and have no recourse .but to pay.",UNGD
USA,1974,91.	What has gone up by political decision can be reduced by political decision.,UNGD
USA,1974,"92.	Last week President Ford called upon the oil producers to join with consumers in defining a strategy which will meet the world's longterm need for both energy and food at reasonable prices; he set forth the principles which should guide such a policy; and he announced to this Assembly America's determination to meet our responsibilities to help alleviate another grim reality world hunger. At a time of universal concern for justice and in an age of advanced technology, it is intolerable that millions are starving and hundreds of millions remain undernourished.",UNGD
USA,1974,"93.	The magnitude of the longterm problem is clear. At present rates of population growth, world food production must double by the end of this century to maintain even the present inadequate dietary level and an adequate diet for all would require that we triple world production. If we are true to our principles, we have an obligation to strive for an adequate supply of food to every man, woman and child in the world. This is a technical possibility, a political necessity and a moral imperative.",UNGD
USA,1974,"94.	The United States is prepared to join with all nations at the World Food Conference in Rome to launch the truly massive effort which is required. We will present a number of specific proposals: to help developing nations, which have the lowest yields and the largest amounts of unused land and water and whose potential in food production must be made to match their growing need; to increase substantially global fertilizer production, for we must end once and for all the world's chronic fertilizer shortage; to expand international, regional and national research programs because scientific and technical resources mus? hi mobilized now to meet the demands of the year 2030 and beyond; to rebuild the world's food reserves, as our capacity for dealing with famine must be freed from the vagaries of weather; and to provide a substantial level of concessionary food aid. The United States will in the coming year increase the value of our own food aid shipments to countries in need. We make this commitment despite great pressures on our economy and at a time when we are seeking to cut our own Government's budget, because we realize the dimensions of the tragedy with which we are faced. All of us here have a common obligation to prevent the poorest nations from being overwhelmed and to enable them to build the social, economic and political base for self-sufficiency.",UNGD
USA,1974,"95.	The hopes of every nation for a life of peace and plenty rest on an effective international resolution of the crises of inflation, fuel and food. We must act now and we must act together.",UNGD
USA,1974,96.	Let us never forget that all of our political endeavors are ultimately judged by one standard to translate our actions into human concerns.,UNGD
USA,1974,"97.	The United States will never be satisfied with a world where man's fears overshadow his hopes. We support the United Nations efforts in the fields of international law and human rights. We approve of the activities of the United Nations .in social, economic and humanitarian realms around the world. The United States considers the World Population Conference, held last month, the World Food Conference to be held a month from now and the continuing Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea of fundamental importance to our common future.",UNGD
USA,1974,"98.	In the coming months the United States will make specific proposals for the United Nations to initiate a major international effort to prohibit torture; a concerted campaign to control the disease which afflicts and debilitates over 200 million people in 70 countries schistosomiasis; and a substantial strengthening of the world's capacity to deal with natural disaster, especially the improvement of the Office of the United Nations Disaster Relief Coordinator.",UNGD
USA,1974,"99.	We have long lived in a world where the consequences of our failures were manageable a world where local conflicts were contained, nuclear weapons threatened primarily those nations which possessed them, and the cycle of economic growth and decline seemed principally a national concern. But that is no longer the case. It is no longer possible to imagine that conflicts, weapons and recession will not spread.",UNGD
USA,1974,100.	We must now decide. The problems we face will be with .us the greater part of the century. But will they be with us as challenges to be overcome or as adversaries that have vanquished us?,UNGD
USA,1974,"101.	It is easy to agree to yet another set of principles or to actions other nations should take. But the needs of the poor will not be met by slogans; the needs of an expanding global economy will not be met by new restrictions; the search for peace cannot be conducted on the basis of confrontation. So each nation must ask what it can do, what contribution it is finally prepared to make to the common good.",UNGD
USA,1974,"102.	Beyond peace, beyond prosperity, lie man's deepest aspirations to a life of dignity and justice. And beyond our pride, beyond our concern for the national purpose we are called upon to serve, there must be a concern for the betterment of the human condition. White we cannot, in the brief span allowed to each of us, undo the accumulated problems of centuries, we dare not do less than try. So let us now get on with our tasks.",UNGD
USA,1974,"103.	Let us act in the spirit of Thucydides that ""the bravest are surely those who have the clearest vision of what is before them, glory and danger alike, and yet notwithstanding go out to meet it"".",UNGD
USA,1975,"At the outset, let me say how pleased we are that our deliberations this year take place under the presidency of the Prime Minister of Luxembourg. His contribution to European co-operation, his diplomatic skills,",UNGD
USA,1975,"' his devotion to democracy, give us confidence that this thirtieth session will be marked by a constructive and creative spirit.",UNGD
USA,1975,"63.	I want also to pay a tribute to the Secretary- General, whose fairness, leadership and tireless efforts are dedicated to carrying this Organization forward into a new era of co-operation for world peace.",UNGD
USA,1975,"64.	This century has seen war and cataclysm on an unprecedented scale. It has witnessed the breakdown of established patterns of order and practices of international conduct. It has suffered global economic depression and cycles of famine. It has experienced the birth of thermonuclear weapons, and the proliferation of armaments around the planet.",UNGD
USA,1975,"65.	But this century has also seen the triumph of the principle of self-determination and national independence. A truly global community has begun to evolve, and this development is reflected in a multitude of institutions of international co-operation. We have shaped new methods of peaceful settlement and of arms limitation, and new institutions to promote economic development and to combat hunger and disease world-wide.",UNGD
USA,1975,"66.	As we deliberate the future, an event of potentially vast implications has just been achieved in this Organization: the unanimous agreement produced by the seventh special session of the General Assembly on measures to improve the economic condition of mankind [resolution 3362 (S-VII)].",UNGD
USA,1975,"67.	Despite differences of ideology and of approaches to economic development, the nations assembled here began the move towards the recognition that our interdependence spells either common progress or common disaster; that in our age no nation or group of nations can achieve its aims by pressure or by confrontation and that the attempt to do so would damage everyone. They agreed to transcend the stereotypes of the past in the search for a co-operative future. The seventh special session forged a sense of common purpose based on the equality and co-operation of States. Now we must dedicate ourselves to the implementation of this consensus.",UNGD
USA,1975,68.	Let us carry forward the spirit of conciliation into the deliberaDigitiZed by Dag HammarSkjoid LibraryLet us address the issues of world peace the foundation of all we do on this planet with this same consciousness of our common destiny. It is our duty to avoid empty slogans and endless recrimination.,UNGD
USA,1975,"69.	Only in a structure of co-operation can disputes be settled and clashes contained. Only in an atmosphere of conciliation can the insecurity of nations, out of which so much conflict arises, be eased, and habits of compromise and accommodation be nurtured. Social progress, justice and human rights can thrive only in an atmosphere of reduced international tension.",UNGD
USA,1975,"70.	The United States stands ready to dedicate itself to co-operative efforts to harmonize the different perspectives of the world community in creating a new sense of security and well-being. We do so, not out of fear, for we are better able to sustain ourselves in situations of confrontation than most other nations. Nor do we do so out of a sense of guilt, for we believe that on the whole we have used our power for constructive ends.",UNGD
USA,1975,"71.	We affirm our common destiny because of our recognition of global interdependence and because global peace requires it. Indeed there is no realistic alternative to shared responsibility in dealing with the international agenda of peace, security, economic well-being and justice.",UNGD
USA,1975,72.	Let me set forth the views of the United States on the work we face in each of these areas.,UNGD
USA,1975,"73.	Our first and transcendent concern is for peace in the world. Peace is never automatic. It is more than the absence of war. And it is inseparable from security, A world in which the survival of nations is at the mercy of a few would spell oppression and injustice and fear. There can be no security without equilibrium and no safety without restraint.",UNGD
USA,1975,"74.	Only when the rights of nations are respected, when accommodation supplants force, can man's energies be devoted to the realization of his deepest aspirations.",UNGD
USA,1975,75.	The United States will pursue the cause of peace with patience and an attitude of conciliation in many spheres. We shall nurture and deepen the ties of co-operation with our friends and allies. We shall strive to improve relations with countries of different ideology or political conviction. We shall always stand ready to assist in the settlement of regional disputes. We shall intensify our efforts to halt the spiral of nuclear armaments. We shall strive to improve man's economic and social condition and to strengthen the collaboration between developed and developing nations. And we shall struggle for the realization of fundamental human rights.,UNGD
USA,1975,"76.	America's close ties with the industrial democracies of North America, Western Europe and Japan have been the corner-stone of world stability and peace for three decades. Today, looking beyond immediate security and defence, we are working together on a range of new issues. Through our consultations, we have begun joint efforts to ease inter-national tensions; to co-ordinate our national policies for economic recovery; to work together on common challenges such as energy and the environment; and to address the great issues that concern the developing countries.",UNGD
USA,1975,"77.	In the same spirit, the United States has opened a new dialog with its neighbors in Central and Latin America. We have taken important steps towards resolving major political problems; we have begun close consultations for co-operation in promoting economic and social development. Alliance relations in the Western Hemisphere have a long history and great promise for the future. With imagination and dedication, we can make inter-American co-operation on the tasks of development an example to and a pillar of the global community.",UNGD
USA,1975,"78.	Peace, to be secure, must place on a more durable and reliable basis the relations between the nations possessing the means to destroy our planet.",UNGD
USA,1975,"79.	In recent years, the bipolar confrontation of the last generation has given way to the beginning of dialog and an easing of direct conflict. In this body, of all organizations, there is surely an appreciation of the global importance of lessened tension between the nuclear super-Powers. All nations have a stake in its success. When weapons of mass destruction can span continents in minutes, nuclear conflict threatens the survival of all mankind.",UNGD
USA,1975,80.	We recognize that the suspicion and rivalry of a generation will not be swept away with a document or a conference. Real ideological and political differences exist. We shall firmly defend our vital interests and those of our friends. But we shall also never lose sight of the fact that in our age peace is a practical necessity and a moral imperative. We shall pursue the relaxation of tensions on the basis of strict reciprocity. We know the difference between posturing and policy; we will not encourage the belief that anyone can benefit from artificial tensions. We are deeply conscious that we owe it to future generations not to be swayed by momentary passions.,UNGD
USA,1975,"81.	The state of United States-Soviet relations today and just a decade ago presents a dramatic contrast. The world is no longer continually shaken by chronic and bitter confrontations. Periodic consultations including those held at the highest level encourage restraint and amplify areas of mutual interest. The forthcoming meeting between the President of the United States, Mr. Ford, and the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Mr. Brezhnev, should strengthen this process.",UNGD
USA,1975,"82.	Principles of mutual restraint have been enunciated at various summit meetings; they were reaffirmed by the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe two months ago. These principles provide a standard of behavior by which our actions will be tested. If they are observed as we insist and if neither side seeks unilateral advantage, the specter of general war will be lifted not only from our own peoples but from all nations. There can be no more important task before us.",UNGD
USA,1975,83.	We have likewise pursued more constructive and beneficial relationships with the countries of Eastern Europe. The United States has many traditional and deep-rooted bonds of friendship with the proud peoples of that region. We see widening possibilities for practical co-operation as the barriers between East and West in Europe diminish.,UNGD
USA,1975,,UNGD
USA,1975,84.	There is no relationship to which the United States assigns greater significance than its new ties with the People's Republic of China. We believe that the well-being and progress of a quarter of humanity is an important element in global stability. The hostility of decades between our two nations has been replaced by a relationship of mutual respect which is now a durable feature of the world scene. It serves not only the interest of our two countries but also the broader interests of peace and stability in Asia and around the world. President Ford plans to visit the People's Republic of China later this year to confirm the vitality of our relationship and to advance the ties between us on the basis of the strict implementation of the Shanghai Communique. We take seriously the process of normalizing our relationship. We are dedicated to pursuing it.,UNGD
USA,1975,85.	The world community must find a way to contain or resolve regional conflicts before they spread into global confrontation. Nowhere has the danger been greater than in the Middle East. Nowhere has the need for persistent and imaginative negotiation between suspicious rivals been more evident. Nowhere is there greater promise of moving from perennial crisis towards peace. Nowhere has the Security Council established a clearer framework than in its resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).,UNGD
USA,1975,86.	The road towards a lasting peace stretches long and hard before us. The Middle East has seen more than its share of dashed hopes and disappointment. But the conclusion of the recent Sinai agreement1 marks a major step forward. It is the first agreement in the long and tragic history of the Arab-Israeli conflict which is not the immediate consequence of hostilities. It could mark a turning-point.,UNGD
USA,1975,87.	The agreement deserves the support of all the countries assembled here because every nation here has an interest in progress towards peace in the Middle East. It is another step in the process launched by Security Council resolution 338 (1973). The alternative was a continuing stalemate which would have led over time to another war creating a serious threat to world peace and the prospect of global economic confrontations.,UNGD
USA,1975,"88.	Neither fear of the future nor pride should obscure the fact that an unusual opportunity for further progress on all issues now exists. But opportunities must be seized or they will disappear. I want to emphasize that the United States did not help negotiate this agreement in order to put an end to the process of peace, but to give it new impetus.",UNGD
USA,1975,89.	President Ford has stated that we will not accept stalemate or stagnation in the Middle East. That was true before the Sinai agreement was signed; it remains true today. The objective of our policy is not merely to create another temporary truce but to sustain the momentum of negotiations. The United States is determined to take every feasible step to help promote further practical progress towards final peace.,UNGD
USA,1975,"90.	As a first step, it is essential that the Sinai agreement be carried out impeccably, within the terms and the time-frame that are stipulated.",UNGD
USA,1975,"91.	In the improved atmosphere thus created, the United States stands ready to participate in any promising initiative towards peace at the request of the parties concerned.",UNGD
USA,1975,92.	We have made clear that we are prepared to make a serious effort to encourage negotiations between Syria and Israel.,UNGD
USA,1975,"93.	We also intend to consult over the coming weeks with all concerned regarding the reopening of the Geneva Conference which met at an early crucial phase. As co-Chairmen of the Geneva Conference together with the Soviet Union, our two countries have special responsibilities in this regard.",UNGD
USA,1975,94.	We are prepared also to explore possibilities for perhaps a more informal multilateral meeting to assess conditions and to discuss the future.,UNGD
USA,1975,95.	The United States seeks no special benefit; we do not attempt to exclude any country. We will cooperate with any nation that is willing to make a contribution. We have no preference for any particular procedure. We will support whatever process seems most promising. Our approach will continue to be both flexible and determined.,UNGD
USA,1975,"96.	The search for final peace must be conducted on a wide basis. We are in frequent touch with Governments in the Middle East. We have begun discussions with the Soviet Union with a view to assessing the current situation and weighing possible diplomatic approaches to bring about a just and durable peace in accordance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). While we have had important differences with the Soviet Union, our two countries have held parallel views that the situation in the Middle East poses grave dangers and that partial steps must be part of and contribute to progress towards a comprehensive settlement.",UNGD
USA,1975,"97.	The role of the world Organization remains essential. If this Organization had no other accomplishment than its effective peace-keeping role in this troubled area, it would have well justified itself. These soldiers of peace, wearing the blue beret of the United Nations, as members of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization in Palestine, the United Nations Emergency Force, and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force have become indispensable to the maintenance of the two 1974 disengagement accords as well as the Sinai agreement. I want to take this occasion to salute the Secretary- General, Mr. Waldheim, and his staff, and General Siilasvuo, the Chief Coordinator of the United Nations peace-keeping missions in the Middle East, and all the men and women from many countries who have served in these forces which have no enemy.",UNGD
USA,1975,"98.	The deliberations of this Assembly regarding the Middle East also play a central role. They can encourage progress or exacerbate tensions. Procedural decisions can be based on the recognition that dialog requires universality of membership, or they can fuel a futile, self-defeating effort to discriminate in violation of the Charter against a Member State whose participation is vital for a solution.",UNGD
USA,1975,"99.	The Middle East will continue to be an area of anguish, turmoil, and peril until a just and durable peace is achieved. Such a peace must meet the principal concerns and interests of all in the area; among and security and the legitimate interests of the Palestinians.",UNGD
USA,1975,"100.	In the Middle East today here is a yearning for peace surpassing any known for three decades. Let us not doom the region to another generation of futile struggle. Instead, let the world community seize the historic opportunity before it. The suffering of all the peoples of the Middle East cry out for it; the hopes and interests of all the world's peoples demand it. The United States promises its full dedication to further progress towards peace.",UNGD
USA,1975,101.	The contribution of the United Nations to the process of peace is essential in Cyprus as well. The Secretary-General has the responsibilities of organizing the peace-keeping forces on the island and of facilitating the talks between the leaders of the Greek and Turkish communities.,UNGD
USA,1975,102.	Strict maintenance of the cease-fire is imperative. For this we look to the restraint of the parties and the efficacy of the United Nations peace-keeping forces.,UNGD
USA,1975,103.	We know that the world community shares our sense of urgency that the negotiating process be resumed and that the parties demonstrate flexibility and statesmanship. The status quo on the island must not become permanent; a rapid and equitable solution is essential. The Secretary-General has worked tirelessly and imaginatively under the most difficult circumstances to narrow the differences. He deserves the full support of the parties and of every nation here.,UNGD
USA,1975,"104.	The details of a Cyprus settlement are for the two communities themselves to decide. However, in keeping with United Nations resolutions which the United States has fully supported, the following principles are believed by my Government to be essential:",UNGD
USA,1975,"(a)	A settlement must preserve the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus. It must ensure that both the Greek Cypriot and the Turkish Cypriot communities can live in freedom and have a large voice in their own affairs.",UNGD
USA,1975,(b)	The present dividing lines cannot be permanent. There must be movement from these lines to agreed territorial arrangements which reflect the economic requirements of the Greek Cypriot community and take account of its self-respect.,UNGD
USA,1975,(t ) There must be provision for the withdrawal of foreign military forces other than those present under the authority of international agreements.,UNGD
USA,1975,(id) There must be security for all Cypriots; the needs and wishes of the refugees who have been the principal victims and whose tragic plight touches us all must be dealt with speedily and with compassion.,UNGD
USA,1975,"105.	Another area where this Organization will be called upon to take responsible actions is the Korean peninsula. This requires, above all, maintenance of the armistice, pending agreement by all of the parties most directly concerned to replace it with a new arrangement. The existing Armistice Agreement is the only legal instrument committing the parties to maintain the peace. It is a carefully designed structure for monitoring and policing the military demarcation line.",UNGD
USA,1975,106.	The United Nations Commander-in-Chief is a signatory to that Agreement. The armistice machinery functions daily. None of the signatories has repudiated it. Nor could they do so without serious risks to the peace of the world.,UNGD
USA,1975,"107.	Since 1972, South and North Korea have pledged themselves to enter into a dialog and to seek unification without resort to arms. This Assembly in 1973 and 1974 encouraged this process first in a consensus supporting talks between the two sides, then in a resolution [resolution 3333 (XXIX)] which looked towards termination of the United Nations Command. The United States agrees that 20 years after the end of the Korean war it is timely to terminate the United Nations Command. We have, in fact, sponsored a draft resolution to that effect which is now before you.",UNGD
USA,1975,"108.	It would be foolhardy, however, to terminate the United Nations Command without new arrangements to preserve the integrity of the Armistice Agreement. In the interest of peace, the United States cannot accept any solution which fails to provide for the continuing validity of the Armistice Agreement.",UNGD
USA,1975,109.	The Republic of Korea and the United States have stated their general readiness to meet with representatives of the other side and with other members of the Security Council to discuss the termination of the United Nations Command while preserving the Armistice Agreement.,UNGD
USA,1975,"110.	Today I can be more specific. The United States and the Republic of Korea, looking forward to the time when a lasting solution of the Korean problem can be achieved, are herewith proposing to the parties to the Armistice Agreement the convening of a conference to discuss ways to preserve it. At such a meeting we would also be prepared to explore other measures to reduce tensions on the Korean peninsula, including the possibility of a larger conference to negotiate a more fundamental arrangement.",UNGD
USA,1975,"111.	It would be in keeping with this spirit of dialog for this body to open its doors to full membership for the two Korean Governments. The United States supports the dual entry of both South and North Korea into the United Nations without prejudice to their eventual reunification. For our part, if North Korea and its allies would move to improve their relations with the Republic of Korea we would be prepared to take similar reciprocal action. It goes without saying that no proposal for security arrangements on the Korean peninsula which attempts to exclude the Republic of Korea from the discussions can be accepted by the United States.",UNGD
USA,1975,112.	The United Nations can contribute significantly to the process of peace on the Korean peninsula by supporting a responsible approach.,UNGD
USA,1975,113.	Over the past year the United States has followed carefully and with great sympathy the efforts to reach peaceful settlements in southern Africa.,UNGD
USA,1975,"114.	We welcome the statesmanlike efforts of both black and white African leader: who are seeking to prevent violence and bloodshed and to promote a negotiated settlement in Rhodesia. The differences between the two communities in that country, while substantial, have been narrowed in the last decade. Both sides in Rhodesia, and Rhodesia's neighbors,",UNGD
USA,1975,Digitized by Dag Hammarskjold Library,UNGD
USA,1975,war. The United States will support all efforts to bring about a peaceful settlement.,UNGD
USA,1975,"115.	In underlining our goal of peaceful change for southern Africa, I want to emphasize the importance of an early settlement in Namibia. My Government's opposition to South Africa's continuing occupation of Namibia and our rejection of South Africa's apartheid system are well known. The United States has consistently conveyed our position on this subject to South Africa. We will continue to do so.",UNGD
USA,1975,"116.	We believe that the people of Namibia should be given the opportunity, within a short time, to express their views on the political future and constitutional structure of their country, freely and under United Nations supervision.",UNGD
USA,1975,"117.	Peace in the world will be fragile and tenuous without a curb and, eventually, an end to the arms race. This is why the United States has embarked, with the Soviet Union, upon the difficult and complex negotiation to limit strategic arms. Our objectives are to prevent unchecked destabilizing competition in strategic armaments; to achieve reduction of these arms; to lessen further the likelihood of hasty decisions in times of crisis; and to ease the economic burden of the nuclear arms race.",UNGD
USA,1975,"118.	The Vladivostok accord of last autumn marked a major step towards achieving these goals. When this agreement in principle is translated into a treaty, agreed ceilings will be placed on strategic force levels for a 10-year period. This unprecedented step will slow the pace of new arms programs, especially those driven by fear of major deployments by the other side.",UNGD
USA,1975,"119.	The United States is actively engaged in other amis control negotiations. Together with the Soviet Union, we have made progress towards establishing a regime for peaceful nuclear explosions, and we have agreed to set a threshold on the underground testing of nuclear weapons. These are significant steps towards a. verifiable comprehensive test ban.",UNGD
USA,1975,"120.	In addition, the United States and the Soviet Union have presented to the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament identical drafts of a convention on the prohibition of military or any other hostile use of environmental modification techniques [A/10027, annex II, documents CCDI47I and CCD/472]. Misuse of this knowledge might open new avenues of military competition and wreak untold and irreversible harm upon all humanity. We urge the Conference to complete its consideration rapidly.",UNGD
USA,1975,121.	Another urgent task is a substantia] reduction in the high levels of military forces now confronting each other in various parts of the world. The United States believes that the time has come to give new impetus to the negotiations on mutual and balanced force reductions in central Europe. The significance of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe depends to an important extent on whether we can achieve progress in this area. An agreement that enhances mutual security in central Europe is feasible and essential. We will work towards that goal.,UNGD
USA,1975,"122.	The world faces a paradox with respect to the proliferation of nuclear energy. Men have fashioned from the atom weapons which can in minuter end the civilization of centuries. Simultaneously, the atom is fast becoming a more and more essential source of energy. It is clear that the cost and eventual scarcity of oil and other fossil fuels will increasingly spread nuclear power around the world in the decades ahead.",UNGD
USA,1975,"123.	But the spreading of nuclear power poses starkly the danger of proliferating nuclear weapons capabilities and the related risks of the theft of nuclear materials, blackmail by terrorists, accidents or the injection of the nuclear threat into regional political conflicts. Now is the time to act. If we fail to restrain nuclear proliferation, future generations will live on a planet shadowed by nuclear catastrophe.",UNGD
USA,1975,"124.	Over the past year the United States has repeatedly urged new efforts among the supplier States to strengthen and standardize safeguards and controls on the export of nuclear materials. We must not allow these safeguards to be eroded by commercial competition. We must ensure the broad availability of peaceful nuclear energy under safe, economical and reliable conditions.",UNGD
USA,1975,"125.	The United States has intensified its efforts within the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA ] and with other nations to broaden and strengthen international standards and safeguards, and has proposed an international convention setting standards to protect the physical security of nuclear materials in use, storage and transfer.",UNGD
USA,1975,"126.	The United States continues to urge the widest possible adherence to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex] and the associated safeguard measures of the IAEA.",UNGD
USA,1975,"127.	The greatest single danger of unrestrained nuclear proliferation resides in the spread, under national control, of reprocessing facilities for the atomic materials in nuclear power plants. The United States therefore proposes, as a major step to reinforce all other measures, the establishment of multinational regional nuclear fuel-cycle centers. These centers would serve energy needs on a commercially sound basis and encourage regional energy co-operation. Their existence would reduce the incentive for small and inefficient reprocessing facilities, limit the possibility of diverting peaceful nuclear materials to national military use, and create a better framework for applying effective international safeguards.",UNGD
USA,1975,128.	We urge that groups of nations begin now to explore this concept and that all States support the work of the IAEA in this field.,UNGD
USA,1975,"129.	In the last two years the world community has been reminded dramatically to what extent economic relations are an essential foundation of the economic order. It would be one of history's most tragic ironies if, at a time when .. i are putting behind us the tensions of the cold war, we were to enter a new period of conflict between North and South, rich and poor. At the recently concluded seventh special session, the United States called for an end to the sterile confrontations of the past. We stated that, when the ancient dream of mankind, a world without poverty, becomes a possibility, our moral convictions also make it a duty. And we emphasized that only co-operation, not extortion, can achieve gives us ground for hope that, at least for the immediate future, a choice has been made to turn away from confrontation towards co-operation. The United States is proud to support the final document [resolution 3362 (S-VII)], which is the product of the arduous effort and dedication of so many in this chamber.",UNGD
USA,1975,"130.	The United States considers the achievements of the seventh special session a beginning, not an end. As recommended in the final report, we must now move forward in available forums to give reality and content to the objectives on which we have agreed. In the difficult negotiations ahead my Government will participate energetically, in a co-operative and conciliatory spirit.",UNGD
USA,1975,"131.	Beyond peace, security and prosperity lies a deeper universal aspiration to dignity and equal opportunity. Mankind will never be spared all the tragedies inherent in the cycle of life and death. But we do have it in our power to eliminate or to ease the burden of social tragedy and of organized injustice.",UNGD
USA,1975,132.	The United States has traditionally been an advocate of extending the reach of international law in international affairs. We have offered our help to the victims of disease and natural disaster. There is no longer any dispute that international human rights are on the agenda of international diplomacy.,UNGD
USA,1975,"133.	The reach of international law must extend to the last frontiers of our planet, the oceans. They are the common heritage of mankind, but they can turn into arenas of conflict unless governed by law. They hold untapped sources of energy, minerals and proteins; their environmental integrity is crucial to our survival.",UNGD
USA,1975,134.	The United States welcomes the United Nations mandate for a comprehensive treaty governing the use of the oceans and their resources. Last month at Montreal I set forth our approach to this negotiation and urged that next year's session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea move matters to a rapid and successful conclusion. No international negotiation is more vital for long-term political and economic stability and the prosperity of our globe.,UNGD
USA,1975,"135.	International law must also come to grips with international terrorism. Innumerable innocent lives have been lost as a consequence of the lack of internationally accepted standards specifically designed to avert unlawful and dangerous interference with civil aviation. The hijacking of aircraft, the kidnapping and murder of innocent civilian victims for presumed political gain remain a plague on civilized man. This remains one of the under-developed areas of international law which merits the most urgent attention of this Organization.",UNGD
USA,1975,"136.	Compassion for our fellow men requires also that we mobilize international resources to combat the age-old scourges of mankind: disease, famine and natural disaster.",UNGD
USA,1975,"137.	The great human rights must be recognized, respected and given reality in the affairs of nations. The earliest United Nations declarations and the recent Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe leave no doubt that these are matters of international concern. The United States will support these principles. Throughout the world, in all continents, violations of human rights must be opposed whether they are inflicted by one race upon another or upon members of the same race. Human rights must be cherished regardless of race, sex or religion. There can be no double standard.",UNGD
USA,1975,138.	The United Nations Commission on Human Rights has taken its first steps against gross violations of human rights where serious and reliable allegations are submitted by individuals. We support those steps. The organized concern of the world community can be a potent weapon in the war against degradation of human values.,UNGD
USA,1975,"139.	One of the most persistent and serious problems is torture, a practice which all nations should abhor. It is an absolute debasement of the function of government with  its overwhelming power is used not for people's welfare but as an instrument of their suffering.",UNGD
USA,1975,"140.	The United States urges this Assembly to adopt the draft Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Being Subjected to Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, recommended for adoption by the Assembly by the Fifth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, held at Geneva recently.4 In addition, we propose that this General Assembly establish a group of experts, to be appointed by the Secretary-General, to study the nature and extent of torture in the world today and to report back to the next session of our Assembly.",UNGD
USA,1975,"141.	This Organization was created in the belief that the universality of the human race can be reflected in the conduct of international affairs. This Chamber symbolizes the hope that mankind places in the force of nations working together in the common interest, with reason, responsibility and mutual respect.",UNGD
USA,1975,"142.	The problems we face are complex and perilous. The sterile slogans of yesterday, the solutions of the past, the dwelling upon old resentments, can only widen the gaps between us and allow the dangers to peace and the well-being of our peoples to fester and to grow.",UNGD
USA,1975,"143.	We have it in our power to prove to future generations that the last quarter of the twentieth century was not an era of violence and conflict, but one of the creative epochs of world history.",UNGD
USA,1975,"144.	My country's history tells us that it is possible to fashion unity while cherishing diversity; that common action is possible despite the variety of races, interests and beliefs we see here in this Chamber. Progress and peace and justice are attainable.",UNGD
USA,1975,145.	So we say to all peoples and all Governments: let us fashion together a new world order. Let its arrangements be just. Let the new nations help shape it and feel it is theirs. Let the old nations use their strengths and skills for the benefit of all mankind. Let us all work together to enrich the spirit and to ennoble mankind.,UNGD
USA,1976,"Let me first congratulate this body for electing Ambassador Amerasinghe of Sri Lanka to preside over this thirty-first session of the General Assembly.

USA,1976,"145.	The United Nations was born of the conviction that peace is both indivisible and more than mere stability, that for peace to be lasting it must fulfill mankind's aspirations for justice, freedom, economic well-being, the rule of law and the promotion of human rights. But the history of this Organization has been, in considerable measure, the gradual awareness that humanity would not inevitably share a single approach to these goals.",UNGD
USA,1976,"146.	The United Nations has survived-and helped to manage-30 years of vast change in the international system. It has come through the bitterness of the cold war. It has played a vital role in the dismantling of colonial empires. It has helped to moderate conflicts, and is even now manning truce lines in critical parts of the world. It has carried out unprecedented efforts in such areas as public health, development assistance and technical co-operation.",UNGD
USA,1976,147.	But the most important challenge for this Organization still lies ahead: to vindicate mankind's positive and nobler goals and help nations to achieve a new understanding of community.,UNGD
USA,1976,"148.	With modern communications, human endeavor has become a single experience for peoples in every part of the globe. We share the wonders of science and technology, the trials of industrialization and social change, and a constant awareness of the fate and the dreams of our fellow men.",UNGD
USA,1976,"149.	The world has shrunk, but the nations of the world have not come closer together. Paradoxically, nationalism has been on the rise at the precise time when the most serious issues we all face can only be resolved through a recognition of our interdependence.",UNGD
USA,1976,"150.	Fragmentation has affected even this body. Nations have taken decisions on a bloc or regional basis, or by rigid ideologies, before even listening to the debate in these halls; on many issues positions have been predetermined by prior conferences containing more than half the membership of the United Nations. The tendency is widespread to come here for battle, rather than negotiation. If these trends continue, the hope for world community will dissipate and the moral influence of this Organization will progressively diminish.",UNGD
USA,1976,"151.	This would be a tragedy. Members of this Organization are today engaged in a multiplicity of endeavors to find just solutions for complex and explosive problems. There is a fragile tranquility, but beneath the surface it is challenged by fundamental forces of change -technological, economic and social. More than ever, this is a time for statecraft and restraint, for persistence but also for daring in the pursuit of peace and justice. The doctrines of perpetual strife produce only bloodshed and bitterness; they unleash the forces of destruction and repression and plant the seeds of future conflict. Appeals to hatred-  whether on the basis of race or class or color or nationality or ideology-will in the end rebound against those who launch them and will not advance the cause of freedom and justice in the world. ",UNGD
USA,1976,"152.	Let us never forget that the United Nations benefits the smaller and Weaker nations most of all; for without the rule of law, disputes will be settled as they hive been all too frequently and painfully in history: by tests of strength. It is not the weak that will prevail in s world of chaos.",UNGD
USA,1976,153.	The United States believes that this thirty-First session of the General Assembly must free itself of the ideological and confrontational tactics that marked some of its predecessors and dedicate itself to a program of common action.,UNGD
USA,1976,154.	The United States comes to the General Assembly prepared to work co-operatively on programs of common action. We will offer concrete proposals. We will listen carefully to the ideas of others. We will resist pressure and we shall seek co-operation.,UNGD
USA,1976,"155.	Let me, in this spirit, discuss the three principal challenges we face: the problem of peace, the challenge of economic well-being, and the agenda of global interdependence.",UNGD
USA,1976,"156.	The age of the United Nations has also been an age of frequent conflict. We have been spared a third world war, but we cannot assume that this condition will prevail forever or without exertion. Our generation must build out of the multitude of nations a structure of relations that frees the energies of nations and peoples for the positive endeavors of mankind, without die fear or the threat of war.",UNGD
USA,1976,"157.	Central to American foreign policy are our sister democracies, the industrial nations of North America, Western Europe, the southern Pacific and Japan, and our traditional friends in the Western Hemisphere. We are bound to these nations by ties of history, civilization, culture, shared principles and generations of common endeavors.",UNGD
USA,1976,"158.	Our alliances, founded on the bed-rock of mutual security, now reach beyond the common defense to a new range of issues: the social challenges shared by the advanced technological societies; common approaches to easing tensions with our adversaries; and shaping positive relations with the developing world. The common efforts of the industrial democracies are not directed at exclusive ends, but as a bridge to a broader, more secure and co-operative international system and to increasing freedom and prosperity for all nations.",UNGD
USA,1976,"159.	The United States is proud of its historical friendships in the Western Hemisphere. In the modern era these friendships must be, and they are, based on equality and mutual benefit. We have a unique advantage in this Hemisphere: the great dialog between the developed and the developing nations can find its most creative solution in the Hemisphere where modern democracy was born, and where co-operation between developed and developing, large and small, is a long-standing tradition.",UNGD
USA,1976,"160.	Throughout history, ideology and power have tempted nations to seek unilateral advantage. But the inescapable lesson of the nuclear age is that the politics of tests of strength has become incompatible with the survival of humanity. Traditional power politics becomes irrational when war can destroy civilized life and when neither side can gain a decisive strategic advantage.",UNGD
USA,1976,"161.	Accordingly, the great nuclear Powers have particular responsibilities for restraint and vision. They are in a position to know the full extent of the catastrophe which could overwhelm mankind. They must take care not to fuel disputes if they conduct their rivalries by traditional methods; if they turn local conflicts into aspects of a global competition, sooner or later their conflicts will grow out of control.",UNGD
USA,1976,"162.	The United States believes that the future of mankind requires coexistence with the Soviet Union. Tired slogans cannot obscure the necessity for a more constructive relationship. We will insist that restraint be reciprocal, not just in bilateral relations, but around the globe. There can be no selective detente. We will maintain our defenses and our vigilance. But we know also that tough rhetoric is not strength and that we owe future generations more hopeful prospects than a delicate equilibrium of awesome forces.",UNGD
USA,1976,163.	Peace requires a balance of strategic power. This the United States will maintain. But the United States is convinced that the goal of strategic balance is achievable more safely by agreement than through an arms race. The negotiations on the limitation of armaments are therefore at the heart of United States-Soviet relations.,UNGD
USA,1976,164.	Unprecedented agreements limiting and controlling nuclear weapons have been reached. An historic effort has been made to place a ceiling on the strategic arsenals of both sides in accordance with the Vladivostok communique of 24 November 1974. And once this is achieved we are ready to seek immediately to lower the levels of strategic arms.,UNGD
USA,1976,165.	The United States welcomes the recent progress that has been made in further curtailing nuclear-weapons testing and in establishing a regime for peaceful nuclear explosions for the first time. The two treaties now signed and awaiting ratification should be the basis for further progress in this field.,UNGD
USA,1976,"166.	Together with several of our European allies, we are continuing efforts to achieve a balanced reduction in the military forces facing each other in central Europe. In some respects this is the most complex negotiation on arms limitation yet undertaken. It is our hope that, through patient effort, reciprocal reductions will soon be achieved that enhance the security of all countries concerned.",UNGD
USA,1976,"167.	But coexistence and negotiations on the control of arms do not take place in a vacuum. We have been disturbed by the continuing accumulation of Soviet armaments and by recent instances of military intervention to tip the scales in local conflicts in distant continents. We have noted crude attempts to distort the purposes of peaceful diplomacy and to impede hopeful progress towards peaceful solutions to complex issues.

USA,1976,"169.	We came together out of necessity and a mutual belief that the world should remain free of military blackmail and the will to hegemony. We have set out a new path -in wide-ranging consultations, bilateral exchanges, the opening of offices in our respective capitals and an accelerating movement towards normalization. And we have derived reciprocal benefits- a clearer understanding of the aspirations of our peoples, better prospects for international equilibrium, reduced tensions in Asia and increased opportunities for parallel actions on global issues.",UNGD

The United States is committed to strengthen the bonds between us and to proceed towards the normalization of our relations in strict conformity with the principles of the Shanghai communique of 27 February 1972. As this process moves forward, each side must display restraint and respect for the interests and convictions of the other.

USA,1976,"177.	In recent months, the United States has vigorously sought to help the parties concerned speed up the process towards Namibian independence. The United States favors the following elements: the independence of Namibia within a fixed, short time-limit; the calling of a constitutional conference at a neutral location under the aegis of the United Nations; and the participation in that conference of all authentic national forces, including specifically the South West Africa People's Organization Progress has been made in achieving all those goals. We will exert our efforts to remove the remaining obstacles and bring into being a conference which can then fashion, with goodwill and wisdom, a design for the new State of Namibia and its relationship with its neighbors. We pledge our continued solicitude for the independence of Namibia so that it may, in the end, be a proud achievement of this Organization and a symbol of international co-operation.",UNGD

Less than a week ago the Rhodesian authorities announced that they were prepared to meet with the nationalist leaders of Zimbabwe to form an interim Government to bring about majority rule within two years. That is in itself an historic break from the past. The African Presidents, in calling for immediate negotiations, have shown that, they are prepared to seize this opportunity. And the Government of the United Kingdom, in expressing its willingness to assemble a conference, has shown its high sense of responsibility and concern for the rapid and just independence of Rhodesia.",UNGD
USA,1976,"179.	Inevitably, after a decade of strife, suspicions run deep; many obstacles remain. Magnanimity is never easy, and less so after a generation of bitterness and racial conflict. But let us not lose sight of what has been achieved: a commitment to majority rule within two years; a commitment to form immediately a transitional Government with an African majority in the cabinet and an African prime minister; and a readiness to follow that with a constitutional conference to define the legal framework of an independent Zimbabwe.",UNGD
USA,1976,"180.	The United States, together with other countries, has made major efforts; and we will continue to do what we can to support the hopeful process that is now possible.

USA,1976,"183.	As for the United States, we have become convinced that our values and our interests are best served by an Africa seeking its own destiny, free of outside intervention. Therefore we will back no faction, whether in Rhodesia or elsewhere; we will not seek to impose solutions anywhere.

USA,1976,"187.	At the request of the parties, the United States has been actively engaged in the search for peace in the Middle East. Since the 1973 war, statesmanship on all sides has produced unprecedented steps towards a resolution of that conflict. There have been three agreements that lessen the danger of war; and mutual commitments have been made to pursue the negotiating process with urgency until a final peace is achieved. As a result, we are closer to the goal of peace than at any time in a generation.",UNGD

USA,1976,"195.	Our own views on the problem of Korea are well known. We have called for a resumption of a serious dialog between North and South Korea. We are prepared to have the United Nations Command dissoJved so long as the Armistice Agreement is either preserved or replaced by more durable arrangements. We are willing to improve relations with North Korea, provided that its allies are ready to take similar steps towards the Republic of Korea. We are ready to talk with North Korea about the peninsula's future, but we will not do so without the participation of the Republic of Korea.",UNGD
USA,1976,"196.	Last fall the United States proposed a conference including all the parties most directly concerned- North and South Korea, the United States, and the People's Republic of China to discuss ways of adapting the Armistice Agreement to new conditions and replacing it with more permanent arrangements.  On 22 July, I stated our readiness to meet immediately with those parties. I reaffirm that readiness here today.",UNGD
USA,1976,"197.	If such a conference proves impracticable right now, the United States would support a phased approach. Preliminary talks between North and South Korea, including discussions on the venue and scope of the conference, could start immediately. In that phase the United States and the People's Republic of China could participate as observers or in an advisory role, if the parties so desired. If such discussions yielded concrete results, the United States and China could join the talks formally. This, in turn, could set the stage for a wider conference in which other countries could associate themselves with arrangements that guarantee a durable peace on the peninsula.",UNGD

On those few occasions when representatives of the two Cypriot communities have come together, they have fallen into inconclusive procedural disputes. The passage of time has served only to complicate domestic difficulties and to diminish the possibilities of constructive conciliation.",UNGD
USA,1976,201.	All concerned need to focus on committing themselves to achieving the overriding objectives: assuring the well-being of the suffering Cypriot people and ensuring peace in the eastern Mediterranean.,UNGD
USA,1976,"202.	A settlement must come from the Cypriot communities themselves. It is they who must decide how their island's economy, society and government shall be reconstructed. It is they who must decide the ultimate relationship of the two communities.",UNGD
USA,1976,"203.	The United States is ready to assist in restoring momentum to the negotiating process. We believe that agreeing to a set of principles might help the parties to resume negotiations. We would suggest some concepts along the following lines. A settlement should preserve the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus. The present dividing lines on Cyprus must be adjusted to reduce the area currently controlled by the Turkish side. The territorial arrangement should take into account the economic requirements and humanitarian concerns of the two Cypriot communities, including the plight of those who remain refugees. A constitutional arrangement should provide conditions under which the two Cypriot communities can live in freedom and have a large voice in their own affairs. Security arrangements should be agreed upon that would permit the withdrawal of foreign military forces other than those present under international agreement.",UNGD
USA,1976,"204.	I have discussed this approach with the Secretary- General and with several Western European colleagues. In the days ahead, the United States will consult along these lines with all interested parties. In the meantime, we urge the Secretary-General to continue his dedicated efforts.",UNGD
USA,1976,"205.	I shall now turn to the problems of economic development. The economic division of our planet between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, between the industrial and developing nations is a dominant issue of our time. Our mutual dependence for our prosperity is a reality, not a slogan. It should summon our best efforts to make common progress, to bring mankind's dreams of a better life to closer reality in our lifetime.",UNGD
USA,1976,"206.	There are many reasons why co-operation has not made greater strides. The industrial democracies have sometimes been more willing to pay lip service to the challenge of development than to match rhetoric with real resources. The countries with non-market economies are quite prepared to undertake verbal assaults, but their performance is in inverse ratio to their rhetoric. Their real contribution to development assistance has been minimal. Last year, for example, the non-market economies provided only about 4 per cent of the public aid flowing to the developing nations. The developing nations are understandably frustrated and impatient with poverty, illiteracy and disease. But often they have made demands for change that are as confrontational as they are unrealistic. They sometimes speak of new economic orders as if growth were a quick fix requiring only that the world's wealth be properly redistributed through tests of strength instead of a process of self-help extending over decades. Ultimately, such tactics lose more than they gain, for they undermine the popular support in the industrial democracies which is imperative to provide the resources and market access -available nowhere else- to sustain development.",UNGD
USA,1976,"207.	I believe that the objectives of the developing nations and the objectives of the industrial nations are complementary. Indeed they must be, for neither side can achieve its aims at the expense of the other. They can be realized only through co-operation.",UNGD
USA,1976,"208.	We took a major step forward together a year ago at the seventh special session of this Assembly, and we have since followed through on many fronts. We have taken steps to protect the economic security of developing nations against cyclical financial disaster. The newly expanded compensatory finance facility of the International Monetary Fund has disbursed over $2 billion to developing nations in this year alone. Replenishments of the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank and the Asian Development Bank will provide additional resources for development. World-wide food aid has been expanded. With a United States contribution of $200 million, we have brought the International Fund for Agricultural Development close to operation.",UNGD
USA,1976,"209.	The United States has continued this process by putting forward a number of new proposals at the fourth session of UNCTAD in May 1976. We committed ourselves to improvements in the quality of aid. We agreed to a serious effort to improve markets of 18 basic commodities. These measures, undertaken since we met here just a year ago, assist, not with rhetoric and promises, but in practical and concrete ways, the peoples of the world that are struggling to throw off the chains of poverty.",UNGD
USA,1976,"210.	Much remains to be done. First, the application of science and technology is at the very heart of the development process. The United States, conscious of its pioneering role in technology, has put forward three basic principles, which we shall support with funds aid talent: to train individuals who can identify, select and manage the future technology of the developing world; to build both national and international institutions to create indigenous technology; and to spur the private sector to make its maximum contribution to the development and transfer of technological progress. ",UNGD
USA,1976,"211.	To achieve these goals, we are today extending an invitation to the world conference on science and technology for development, now scheduled for 1979, to meet in this country. In preparation for that meeting, we have asked members of the industrial, academic and professional scientific communities throughout the United States to meet in Washington in November. They will review the important initiatives this country can take to expand the technological base for development and they will strive to develop new approaches.",UNGD
USA,1976,"212.	Secondly, the ministerial meeting of the Conference on International Economic Co-operation in Paris should be given new impetus. We are making several new proposals. We will seek to help nations facing severe debt burdens. We will advance new ideas for expanded co-operation in energy.",UNGD
USA,1976,"213.	Thirdly, the industrial democracies have been far too willing to wait for the demands of the developing countries rather than to advance their own proposals. Now, however, the countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development have, at the suggestion of the United States, agreed to examine long-range development planning and to develop a more coherent and comprehensive approach to global growth and economic justice.",UNGD
USA,1976,"214.	Fourthly, natural disasters each year take thousands of lives and cost billions of dollars. It strikes most those who can afford it least-the poorest peoples of the world. The United Nations has a unique capacity to address these global concerns and thus improve man's odds against nature. We urge this body to take the lead in strengthening international co-operation to prevent and alleviate natural calamity.",UNGD
USA,1976,215.	Our dream is that all the children of the world can live with hope and widening opportunity. No nation can accomplish this alone; no group of nations can achieve it through confrontation. But together there is a chance for major progress-and in our generation.,UNGD
USA,1976,216.	It is an irony of our time that an age of ideological and nationalistic rivalry has spawned as well a host of challenges that no nation can possibly solve by itself: the proliferation of nuclear weapons technology; the problems posed by the law of the sea; and the horrible new tool of tenor that cJiims innocent victims on every continent.,UNGD
USA,1976,"217.	The growing danger of the proliferation of nuclear weapons raises stark questions about man's ability to ensure his very existence. We have lived through three perilous decades hi which the catastrophe of nuclear war has been avoided, despite ? strategic rivalry between a relatively few nations.",UNGD
USA,1976,"218.	But now a wholly new situation impends. Many nations have the potential to build nuclear weapons. If this potential were to materialize, threats to use nuclear weapons, fed by mutually reinforcing misconceptions, could become a recurrent feature of local conflicts in every' quarter of the globe. And there will be growing dangers of accidents, blackmail and nuclear terrorism.",UNGD
USA,1976,"219.	Unless current trends are altered rapidly, the likelihood of nuclear devastation could grow steadily in the years ahead. We must look to the roots of the problem. Since the 1973 energy crisis and drastic rise in oil prices, both developed and developing nations have seen in nuclear energy a means both of lowering the cost of electricity and of reducing reliance upon imported petroleum. In an age of growing nationalism some see the acquisition and expansion of nuclear power as symbols of enhanced national prestige, and, let us be frank, as a means to provide themselves a future option to acquire nuclear weapons.",UNGD
USA,1976,"220.	A nation that acquires the potential for a nuclear weapons capability must accept the consequences of its action. It is bound to trigger offsetting actions by its neighbors and stimulate broader proliferation, thereby accelerating a process that ultimately will undermine its own security. And it is disingenuous to label as ""peaceful"" nuclear devices which obviously are capable of massive military destruction.",UNGD
USA,1976,221.	Time is of the essence. In no area of international concern does the future of this planet depend more directly upon what this generation can do or fails to do. We must move on the following three broad fronts.,UNGD
USA,1976,"222.	First, international safeguards must be strengthened and strictly enforced. The supply and use of nuclear materials associated with civilian nuclear energy programs must be carefully safeguarded so that they will not be diverted. The physical security of nuclear materials must be increased. The International Atomic Energy Agency must receive the full support of all nations in making its safeguards effective. Any violator of these safeguards must face immediate and drastic penalties.",UNGD
USA,1976,"223.	Secondly, adherence to safeguards, while of prime importance, is no guarantee against future proliferation. We must continue our efforts to forge international restraints against the acquisition or transfer of reprocessing facilities and of enrichment facilities which produce highly enriched uranium.",UNGD
USA,1976,"224.	Thirdly, we must recognize that one of the principal incentives for seeking sensitive reprocessing and enrichment technology is the fear that essential non-sensitive materials will not be made available on a reliable basis. Nations that show their sense of international responsibility by accepting effective restraints have a right to expect a reliable. economical supply of peaceful nuclear reactors and associated non-sensitive fuel. The United States, as a principal supplier of these items, is prepared to be responsive in this regard.",UNGD
USA,1976,"225.	In the near future President Ford will announce a comprehensive American program for international action on non-proliferation that reconciles global aspirations for assured nuclear supply with global requirements for nuclear control. In that way we hope that the 9.tom can be seen once again as a boon, and not as a menace, to mankind.",UNGD
USA,1976,"226.	Another issue of vast global consequence is the law of the sea. The negotiations which have just recessed in New York represent one of the most important, complex",UNGD
USA,1976,and ambitious diplomatic undertakings in history.,UNGD
USA,1976,,UNGD
USA,1976,"227.	We have traveled an extraordinary distance in these negotiations in recent years, thanks in no small part to the skill and dedication of the distinguished President of this Assembly. Agreement exists on key concepts: a 12-mile territorial sea; free passage over and through straits; a 200-mile economic zone; and important pollution controls. In many fields we have replaced ideological debates with serious efforts to find concrete solutions. And there is growing consensus that the outstanding problems must be solved at the next session.",UNGD
USA,1976,"228.	But there is hardly room for complacency. Important issues remain which, if not settled, could cause us to forfeit all our hard-won progress. The Conference has yet to agree on the balance between coastal-State and international rights in the economic zone; on the freedom of marine scientific research; on arrangements for dispute settlement; and, most crucially, on the regime for exploitation of the deep sea-beds.",UNGD
USA,1976,"229.	The United States has made major proposals to resolve the deep sea-bed issue. We have agreed that the sea-beds are the common heritage of all mankind We have proposed a dual system for the exploitation of sea-bed minerals by which half of the mining sites would be reserved for the International Authority and half could be developed by individual nations and their nationals on the basis of technical capacity. We have offered to find financing and to transfer the technology needed to make international mining a practical reality. And in light of the many uncertainties that lie ahead, we have proposed that there be a review-for example after 25 years-to determine whether the provisions on sea-bed mining are working equitably.",UNGD
USA,1976,"230.	In response, some nations have escalated their demands and the stridency with which they advocate them.",UNGD
USA,1976,"231.	I must say candidly that there are limits beyond which no American administration can, or will, go. If attempts are made to compel concessions which exceed those limits, unilateralism will become inevitable. Countries which have no technological capacity for mining the sea-beds in the foreseeable future should not seek to impose a doctrine of total internationalization on nations which alone have this capacity and which have voluntarily offered to share it. The United States has an interest in the progressive development of international law, stable order and global co-operation. We are prepared to make significant sacrifices for this- but these sacrifices cannot go beyond equitable bounds.",UNGD
USA,1976,"23*2. Let us therefore put aside delaying tactics and pressures and take the path of co-operation. If we have the vision to conclude a treaty considered fair and just by mankind, our labors will have profound meaning not only for the regimen of the oceans but for all efforts to build a peaceful, co-operative and prosperous international community. The United States will spend the interval between sessions of the Conference reviewing its positions and will approach other nations well in advance of the next session at the political level to establish the best possible conditions for success.",UNGD
USA,1976,"233.	A generation that dreams of world peace and economic progress is plagued by a new, brutal and indiscriminate form of violence: international terrorism. In the year since I last addressed this body there have been 11 hijackings, 19 kidnappings, 42 armed attacks and 112 bombings perpetrated by international terrorists. Over 70 people have lost their lives and over 200 have been injured.",UNGD
USA,1976,"234.	It is time this Organization said to the world that the vicious murder and abuse of innocents cannot be excused by the invocation of lofty motives. Criminal acts against humanity, whatever the professed objective, cannot be excused by any civilized nation.",UNGD
USA,1976,"235.	Hie threat of terrorism should be dealt with through the co-operative efforts of all countries. More stringent steps must be taken now to deny skyjackers and terrorists a safe haven. Additional measures are required to protect passengers in both transit and terminal areas, as well as in flight.",UNGD
USA,1976,"236.	The United States will support new initiatives which will ensure the safety of the innocent. The proposal of the Foreign Minister of the Federal Republic of Germany against the taking of hostages [7th meeting, para.,113] deserves the most serious and sympathetic consideration of this Assembly.",UNGD
USA,1976,"237.	The United States will do everything within its power to work co-operatively in the United Nations and in other international bodies to put an end to terrorism. But we have an obligation to protect the lives of our citizens as they travel at home or abroad, and we intend to meet that obligation. If multilateral efforts are blocked, then the United States will be forced to act through its own legislative processes and in conjunction with others willing to join us.",UNGD
USA,1976,238.	Terrorism is an international problem. It is inconceivable that an organization of the world's nations would fail to take effective action against it.,UNGD
USA,1976,"239.	The final measure of all we do together, of course, is man himself. Our common efforts to define, preserve and enhance respect for the rights of man thus represent an ultimate test of international co-operation.",UNGD
USA,1976,"240.	We Americans, in the year of our bicentennial, are conscious -and proud of our own traditions. Our founders wrote 200 years ago of the equality and inalienable rights of all men. Since then the ideals of liberty and democracy have become the universal and indestructible goals of mankind. But the plain truth -of tragic proportions-is that human rights are in jeopardy over most of the globe. Arbitrary arrest, denial of fundamental procedural rights, slave labor, the stifling of freedom of religion, racial injustice, political repression, the use of torture, and restraints on communications and expression these abuses are far too prevalent.",UNGD
USA,1976,"241.	The performance of the United Nations system in protecting human rights has fallen far short of what was envisaged when the Organization was founded. The principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are clear debates of this body and in other forums have been marred by hypocrisy, double standards and discrimination. Flagrant and consistent deprivation of human rights is no less grave in one country or one social system than in another. Nor is it more acceptable when practiced upon members of the same race than when inflicted by one race upon another.",UNGD
USA,1976,242.	The international community has a unique role to play. The application of the standards of the Universal Declaration should be entrusted to fair and capable international bodies. But at the same time let us ensure that those bodies do not become platforms from which nations which are the worst transgressors pass judgment on the alleged shortcomings of others.,UNGD
USA,1976,"243.	Let us together pursue practical approaches: to build on the foundations already laid at previous sessions of the General Assembly and in the Commission on Human Rights to lessen the abominable practice of officially sanctioned torture; to promote acceptance of procedures for protecting the rights of people subject to detention, such as access to courts, counsel and families,-and their prompt release or fair and public trial; to improve the working procedures of international bodies concerned with human rights, so that they may function fairly and effectively; to strengthen the capability of the United Nations to meet the tragic problems of the ever growing number of refugees whose human rights have been stripped away by conflict in almost every continent. The United States pledges its firm support to these efforts.",UNGD

USA,1976,"244.	The challenge to statesmanship in this generation is to advance from the management of crises to the building of a stable and just international order, an order resting not on power but on restraint of power, not on the strength of arms but on the strength of the human spirit.",UNGD
USA,1976,245.	Global forces of change now shape our future. Order will come in one of two ways: through its imposition by the strong and the ruthless or by the wise and far-sighted use of international institutions through which we enlarge the sphere of Common interests and enhance the sense of community.,UNGD
USA,1976,246.	It is easy and tempting to press relentlessly for national advantage. It is infinitely more difficult to act in recognition of the rights of others.,UNGD
USA,1976,"247.	Throughout history the greatness of men and nations has been measured by their actions in times of acute peril. Today there is no single crisis to conquer. There is, Instead, a persisting challenge of staggering complexity: the need to create a universal community based on co-operation, peace and justice.",UNGD

USA,1977,"1.	 Mr. President, I wish to offer you my congratulations on your election as President of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly.

We pledge our co-operation and we will depend heavily on your experience and skill in guiding these discussions which we are beginning.",UNGD

USA,1977,"3.	Thirty-two years ago, in the cold dawn of the atomic age, this Organization came into being. Its first and most urgent purpose has been to tenure peace for an exhausted and ravaged world.",UNGD
USA,1977,"4.	Present conditions in some respects appear quite hopeful, yet the assurance of peace continues to elude us. Before the end of this century a score of nations could possess nuclear weapons. If this should happen the world we leave our children will mock our own hopes for peace.",UNGD
USA,1977,"5.	The level of nuclear armaments could grow by tens of thousands and the same situation could well occur with advanced conventional weapons, The temptation to use those weapons, or fear that someone else might do it first, would be almost irresistible. The ever-growing trade in conventional arms subverts international commerce from a force for peace to a caterer for war.",UNGD
USA,1977,"6.	Violence, terrorism, assassination and undeclared wars all threaten to destroy the restraint and the moderation that must become the dominant characteristic of our age. Unless we establish a code of international behaviour in which the resort to violence becomes increasingly irrelevant to the pursuit of national interests we will crush the world's dreams for human development and the full flowering of human freedom.",UNGD
USA,1977,"7.	We have already become a global community, but only in the sense that we face common problems and share, for good or evil, a common future. In this community, the power to solve the world's problems, particularly economic and political power, no longer lies solely in the hands of a few nations. Power is now widely shared among many nations with different cultures, different histories and different aspirations. The question is whether we will allow our differences to defeat us or whether we will work together to realize our common hopes for peace.",UNGD
USA,1977,"8.	Today I want to address the major dimensions of peace and the role the United States intends to play in limiting and reducing all armaments, controlling nuclear technology, restricting the arms trade and settling disputes by peaceful means.",UNGD
USA,1977,"9.	When atomic weapons were used for the first time Winston Churchill described the power of the atom as  a revelation long mercifully withheld from man . Since then we have learned, in Durrenmatt’s chilling words, that  what has once been thought can never be unthought .",UNGD
USA,1977,10.	If we are to have any assurance that our children will live out their lives in a world which satisfies our hope—or that they will have a chance to live at all-we must finally come to terms with this enormous nuclear force and turn it to exclusively beneficial ends. Peace will not be assured until the weapons of war are finally put away. While we work towards that goal nations will want sufficient arms to preserve their security. The United States purpose is to ensure peace. It is for that reason that our military posture and our alliances will remain as strong as necessary to deter attack.,UNGD
USA,1977,"11.	However, the security of the global community cannot for ever rest on a balance of terror. In the past, war has been accepted as the ultimate arbiter of disputes among nations, but in the nuclear era we can no longer think of war as merely a continuation of diplomacy by other means. Nuclear war cannot be  measured by the archaic standards of  victory  or  defeat . This stark reality imposes on the ",UNGD

USA,1977,United States and the Soviet Union an awesome and special responsibility.,UNGD
USA,1977,"12.	The United States is engaged along with other nations in a broad range of negotiations. In Strategic Arms Limitation Talks [SALT], we and the Soviets are within sight of a significant agreement in limiting the total numbers of weapons and in restricting certain categories of weapons of special concern to each of us. We can also start the crucial process of curbing the relentless march of technological development which makes nuclear weapons ever more difficult to control.",UNGD
USA,1977,"13.	We must look beyond the present, and work to prevent the critical threats and instabilities of the future. If the principles of self-restraint, reciprocity and mutual accommodation of interests are observed, then the United States and the Soviet Union not only will succeed in limiting weapons but also will create r foundation for better relations in other spheres of interest.",UNGD
USA,1977,"14.	The United States is willing to go as far as possible, consistent with our security interests, in limiting and reducing our nuclear weapons. On a reciprocal basis we are willing now to reduce them by 10 per cent, 20 percent or even 50 per cent, Then we will work for further reductions with a view to a world truly free of nuclear weapons.",UNGD
USA,1977,15.	The United States also recognize the threat of continued testing of nuclear explosives.,UNGD
USA,1977,"16.	Negotiations for a comprehensive ban on nuclear explosions are now being conducted by the United States, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. As in other areas where vital nation J security interests are engaged, agreements must be verifiable and fair. They must be seen by all the parties as serving a longer-term interest that justifies the restraints of the moment. The longer-term interest in this instance is to close one more avenue of nuclear competition and thereby demonstrate to all the world that the major nuclear Powers take seriously our obligations to reduce the threat of nuclear catastrophe.",UNGD
USA,1977,"17.	My country believes that the time has come to end all explosions of nuclear devices, no matter what their claimed justification—peaceful or military-and we appreciate the efforts of other nations to reach this same goal.",UNGD
USA,1977,"18.	During the past nine months, I have expressed the special importance we attach to controlling nuclear proliferation; but I fear that many do not understand why the United States feels as it does. Why is it so important to avoid the chance that one or two or 10 other nations might acquire one or two or 10 nuclear weapons of their own? Let me try to explain, for I deeply believe that this is one of the greatest challenges that we face in the next quarter of a century.",UNGD
USA,1977,19.	It is a truism that nuclear weapons are a powerful deterrent. They are a deterrent because they threaten. They could be used for terrorism or blackmail as well as for war. But they threaten not just the intended enemy; they threaten every nation—combatant and non-combatant alike. That is why all of us must be concerned.,UNGD
USA,1977,"20.	Let me be frank. The existence of nuclear weapons in the United States and the Soviet Union, and in the United Kingdom, France and China, is something we cannot undo except by the painstaking process of negotiation. But the existence of these weapons does not mean that other nations need to develop their own weapons, any more than it provides a reason for those of us who have them to share them with others. Rather it imposes two solemn obligations on the nations which have the capacity to export nuclear fuels and nuclear technologies-the obligation to meet legitimate energy needs and, in doing so, the obligation to ensure that nothing we export contributes, directly or indirectly, to the production of nuclear explosives. That is why the supplier nations arc seeking a common policy, and that is why the United States and the Soviet Unions even as we struggle to find common ground in the SALT talks, have already moved closer towards agreement and co-operation in our efforts to limit nuclear proliferation.",UNGD
USA,1977,"22. I believe that the London suppliers group must conclude its work as it is presently constituted, so that world security will be safeguarded from the pressures of commercial competition. We have learned that it is not enough to safeguard just some facilities or some materials. Full-scope, comprehensive safeguard ire necessary.",UNGD
USA,1977,"23 . Two weeks from now, in our own country, more than SO supplier and consuming nations will convene in Washington for the Conference on International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation which we proposed last spring. For the next several years experts will work together on every facet of the nuclear fuel cycle. The scientists and the policy-makers of these nations will face a tremendous challenge.  We know that, by the year 2000, nuclear power reactors could be producing enough plutonium to make tens of thousands of bombs every year. I believe, from my own personal knowledge of this issue, that there are ways to solve the problems we face. I believe that there are alternative fuel cycles that can be managed safely on global basis. I hope, therefore, that the Conference on the international Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation will have the support and encouragement of every nation.",UNGD
USA,1977,"24.	I have heard it said that efforts to control nuclear proliferation are facile  that thing is already out of the bottle. I do not believe this to be true. It should not be forgotten that for 25 years the nuclear club did not expand its membership., By genuine co-operation we can make certain that this terrible club expands no further.",UNGD
USA,1977,"25.	I have talked about the special problems of nuclear arms control' and nuclear proliferation at length. Let me turn to the problem of conventional arms control, which affects potentially or directly every nation represented in this great hall. This is not a matter for the future-even the near future-but one for the immediate present. World-wide military expenditures are. now in the neighborhood of $300 billion a year. Last year the nations of the world spent more than 60 times as much equipping each soldier as we spent educating each child. The industrialized nations spend the most money, but the rate of growth in military spending is faster in the developing world. While only a handful of states produce sophisticated weapons, the number of nations which seek to purchase these weapons is increasing rapidly.",UNGD
USA,1977,26.	The conventional arms race both causes and feeds on the threat of larger and more deadly wars. It levies an enormous burden on an already troubled world economy.,UNGD
USA,1977,"27.	.For its part, the United States has now begun to reduce its arms exports. Our aim is to reduce both the quantity and the deadliness of the weapons we sell. We have already taken the first few steps, but we cannot go very far alone. Nations whose neighbours are purchasing large quantities of arms feel constrained to do the same. Supplier nations that practise restraint in arms sales sometimes find that they simply lose valuable commercial markets to other suppliers.",UNGD
USA,1977,28.	We hope to work with other supplier nations to cut back on the flow of arms and to reduce the rate at which the most advanced and sophisticated weapon technologies spread around the world. We do not expect this task to be easy or to produce instant results. But we are committed to stop the spiral of the increasing sale of weapons.,UNGD
USA,1977,"29.	Equally important, we hope that purchaser nations, individually and through regional organizations, will limit their arms imports. We are ready to provide to some nations the necessary means for legitimate self-defence, but we are also eager to work with any nation or region in order to decrease the need for more numerous, more deadly and ever more expensive weapons.",UNGD
USA,1977,"30.	Fourteen years ago, one of my predecessors spoke in this hall under circumstances that in certain ways resembled these. It was a time, he said, of comparative calm and there was art atmosphere of rising hope about the prospect of controlling nuclear energy. The first specific step had been taken to limit the nuclear arms race-a test-ban treaty signed by nearly a hundred nations.",UNGD
USA,1977,"31.	But the succeeding years did not live up to the optimistic prospect John F. Kennedy placed before this Assembly because, as a community of nations, we failed to address the deepest sources of potential conflict among us.",UNGD
USA,1977,"32.	As we seek to establish the principles of detente among the major nuclear Powers, we believe that these principles must also apply in regional conflicts. The United States is committed to the peaceful settlement of differences. We are committed to the strengthening of the peace-making capabilities of the United Nations and regional organizations, such as the Organization of African Unity and the Organization of American States.",UNGD
USA,1977,"33.	The United States supports the United Kingdom's efforts to bring about a peaceful, rapid transition to majority rule and independence in Zimbabwe. We joined .other members of the Security Council last week and also the Secretary-General in efforts to bring about independence and democratic rule in Namibia. We are pleased with the level of co-operation we have achieved with the leaders of the nations in the area, as well as with those peoples who are struggling for independence. We urge South Africa and other nations to support the proposed solution to the problems in Zimbabwe, and to co-operate still more closely in providing for a smooth and prompt transition in Namibia.",UNGD
USA,1977,"34.	But it is essential that all outside nations exercise restraint in their actions in Zimbabwe and Namibia, so that we can bring about that majority rule and avoid a widening war that could engulf the southern half of the African continent.",UNGD
USA,1977,"35.	Of all the regional conflicts in the world, none holds more menace than the Middle East. War there has already carried the world to the edge of nuclear confrontation. It has already disrupted the world economy and imposed severe hardships on the people in the developed and the developing nations alike. So true peace-peace embodied in binding treaties—is essential. It will be in the interest of the Israelis and the Arabs. It is in the interest of the American people. It is in the interest of the entire world.",UNGD
USA,1977,"36.	The United Nations Security Council has provided the basis for peace in resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), but negotiations in good faith by all parties is needed to give substance to peace.",UNGD
USA,1977,"37.	Such negotiations in good faith must be inspired by a recognition that all nations in the area-Israel and the Arab countries-have a right to exist in peace, with the early establishment of economic and cultural exchanges and of normal diplomatic relations. Peace must include a process in which the bitter divisions o: generations, even centuries- hatreds and suspicions—can be overcome. Negotiations cannot be successful if any of the parties harbours the deceitful view that peace is simply an interlude in which to prepare for war.",UNGD
USA,1977,38.	Negotiations in good faith will also require acceptance by all sides of the fundamental rights and interest of everyone involved.,UNGD
USA,1977,"39.	For Israel, this means borders that are recognized and secure. Security arrangements are crucial to a nation that has fought for its survival in each of the last four decades. The commitment of the United States to Israel's security is unquestionable.",UNGD
USA,1977,"40.	For the Arabs, the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people must be recognized. One of the things that binds the American people to Israel is our shared respect for human rights and the courage with which Israel has defended such rights. It is clear that a true and lasting peace in the Middle East must also respect the rights of all the peoples of the area. How these rights are to be defined and implemented is, of course; for the interested parties to decide in detailed negotiations, and not for us to dictate.",UNGD
USA,1977,41.	We do not intend to impose from the outside a settlement on the nations of the Middle East.,UNGD
USA,1977,"42.	The United States has been meeting with the Foreign Ministers of Israel and the Arab nations involved in the search for peace. We are staying in close contact with the Soviet Union, with which we share responsibility for reconvening the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East. As a result of these consultations, the Soviet Union and the United States have agreed to call for the resumption of the Geneva Conference before the end of this year. While a number of procedural questions remain, if the parties continue to act in good faith, I believe that these questions can be answered.",UNGD
USA,1977,310,UNGD
USA,1977,"43.	The major Powers have a special responsibility to act with restraint in areas of the world where they have competing interests because the association of these interests with local rivalries and conflicts can lead to serious confrontation. In the Indian Ocean area neither we nor the Soviet Union has a large military presence, nor is there a rapidly mounting competition between us. Restraint in the area may well begin with a mutual effort to stabilize our presence and to avoid an escalation in military competition. Then both sides can consider how our military activities in the Indian Ocean area might be even further-reduced.",UNGD
USA,1977,"44.	The peaceful settlement of differences is, of course, essential. The United States is willing to abide by that principle, as in the case of the recently signed Panama Canal treaties. Once ratified, these treaties can transform the United States-Panama relationship into one that permanently protects the interests and respects the sovereignty of both our countries.",UNGD
USA,1977,"45.	We have all survived and surmounted major challenges since the United Nations was founded, but we can accelerate progress even in a world of ever-increasing diversity. A commitment to strengthen international institutions is vital, but progress lies also in our own national policies. We can work together to form a community of peace if we accept the kind of obligations that I have suggested today.",UNGD
USA,1977,"46.	To summarize: first, there is an obligation to remove the threat of nuclear weaponry, to reverse the build-up of armaments and the trade in them, and to conclude bilateral and multilateral arms control agreements that can bring security to all of us.",UNGD
USA,1977,"47.	In order to reduce the reliance of nations on nuclear weaponry, 1 hereby solemnly declare, on behalf of the United States, that we will not use nuclear weapons except in self-defence; that is, in circumstances of an actual nuclear or conventional attack on the United States, our territories or armed forces, or such an attack on our allies.",UNGD
USA,1977,"48.	In addition, we hope that initiatives by the Western nations to secure mutual and balanced force reductions in Europe will be met by equal response from the Warsaw Pact countries.",UNGD
USA,1977,"49.	Secondly, an obligation to show restraint in areas of tension, to negotiate disputes and settle them peacefully, and to strengthen the peace-making capabilities of the United Nations and regional organizations.",UNGD
USA,1977,"50.	And, finally, an effort by all nations, East as well as West, North as well as South, to fulfil mankind's aspirations for human development and human freedom. It is to meet these basic demands that we build Governments and seek peace.",UNGD
USA,1977,51.	We must share these obligations for our own mutual survival and our own mutual prosperity.,UNGD
USA,1977,52.	We can see a world at peace. We can work for a world without want. We can build a global community dedicated to these purposes and to human dignity.,UNGD
USA,1977,"53.	The view that I have sketched for you today is that of only one leader in only one nation. However wealthy and powerful the United States may be, however capable of leadership, this power is increasingly only relative. The leadership increasingly is in need of being shared. No nation has a monopoly of vision, of creativity or of ideas. Bringing these together from many nations is our common responsibility and our common challenge. For only in these ways can the idea of a peaceful global community grow and prosper.",UNGD

USA,1978,"103.	Mr. President, I congratulate you on your election to this important office.",UNGD
USA,1978,104.	We all learned this morning with shock and sadness of the sudden death of Pope John Paul I. His passing deprives the world of a wise and compassionate leader whose brief ministry had already given promise of greatness.,UNGD
USA,1978,"106.	A generation ago the United Nations was created by men and women who shared a vision. They saw the need in the wake of war to create stronger international institutions that could dampen the flames of conflict and life nations and people to a new level of material well-being; they saw the need to afford self-determination to millions; and they saw the need for the world community to take a compelling stand against repression, discrimination and the denial of the rights of man.",UNGD
USA,1978,107. The men and women who gathered in San Francisco in 1945 raised their sights above the differences and divisions of the moment. They dared to see the world as it could be—a world where- those who are hungry are fed; where those who are poor have escaped the degradation of poverty; where diplomacy among nations is a pervasive substitute for violence among nations; and where the resources of the world are used effectively and shared equitably.,UNGD
USA,1978,"108.	In the years since, the record of the United Nations in working towards that vision has been one of accomplishment. It has played an indispensable part in the process of peaceful decolonization, in defusing tensions among nations through its peace-keeping missions, and in promoting , genuine economic and social progress.",UNGD
USA,1978,109.	Today the Members of this body still share that common vision. And we understand far better than ever before our common destiny: that no nation acting alone can assure for its people peace and economic security; that the future of each of our nations depends upon the future of all of our nations.,UNGD
USA,1978,"110.	Our challenge today is to summon the political, will to act in concert towards the goals we share, to go beyond the rhetoric of interdependence and to begin to recognize its inescapable implications for the national interests of each of us.",UNGD
USA,1978,111.	We must build a new consensus on this proposition: that in this new era each nation must weigh more carefully than ever before its long-term interest in a healthy global community when making decisions about its immediate concerns. For only through co-operation and compromise in the short run can we assure our longer-term future.,UNGD
USA,1978,"112.	On crucial issues, the coming months will present turning-points of incalculable importance. In negotiations on the Middle East, on southern Africa, on trade, on arms control and on many other pressing problems, genuine progress has been made. Without continued progress, the gains we have already made can be lost.",UNGD
USA,1978,"113.	This point applies not to any single nation nor any group of nations but to every nation, including my own.",UNGD
USA,1978,"114.	The resolution of dangerous regional disputes and progress in limiting weaponry must always be at the top of the immediate international agenda. I shall return to these issues later. But we cannot so concentrate our energies on the political diplomacy of international peace, essential as it is, that we discover too late that international inequities and poverty and injustice within nations make peace among nations impossible.",UNGD
USA,1978,"115.	So let me concentrate my comments today on those issues that so centrally touch people's lives around the globe-economic security, the equitable development of the earth's resources and individual freedom.",UNGD
USA,1978,"116.	Shared economic progress requires a global consensus on the benefits of co-operation among nations. Cooperation and compromise are often difficult. The economic problems we share require long-term efforts, but we are all constrained by domestic concerns which call for immediate attention; the problems we share are so widespread in their impact that solutions cannot be found by a single nation or group of nations; and these problems require more than general agreements. The application of substantial technical and financial resources is necessary. Debate over sterile texts will neither feed the hungry nor create new jobs for the unemployed. Only common action can be effective. And each must contribute if all are to benefit.",UNGD
USA,1978,"117.	Only three or four years ago there was extraordinary tension between North and South. Each side was deeply suspicious of the other's motives. Each held sharply different perceptions of global needs and priorities. But these differences have been narrowed. From the seventh special session of the General Assembly through the fourth session of UNCTAD, the Conference on International Economic Co-operation and the meetings of this Assembly, and through other serious efforts in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and the economic summits, agreement has been achieved on several basic issues relating to a new international economic order.",UNGD
USA,1978,118.	We are agreed on the need to work towards the elimination of poverty in all countries. Concessional aid flows have been increased. More attention is being devoted to food production. Satisfying basic economic needs is becoming a greater priority of the international community.,UNGD
USA,1978,"119.	We are agreed on the urgent need to accelerate equitable non-inflationary growth. The round of multilateral trade negotiations within the framework of GATT now proceeding at Geneva are in their final stages. We are discussing guidelines for international investment. Private capital flows are increasing. The facilities of IMF have been expanded, and discussions are under way to expand the facilities of the multilateral development banks.",UNGD
USA,1978,"120.	We are agreed on the need to reduce economic instability and uncertainty. The IMF is playing a major role in providing balance-of-payments financing to those most severely affected by recent disruptions in the world economy. We are engaged in serious discussions on a variety of commodity arrangements, including a system of internationally co-ordinated national grain reserves.",UNGD
USA,1978,121.	And we are agreed on the need to facilitate smooth adjustment for workers and businesses that have borne the brunt of changing economic circumstances. The Bonn Economic Summit Conference this year made clear that we must intensify our efforts in this area.,UNGD
USA,1978,"122.	Because we have come far, the road ahead will be even more challenging, for the most difficult issues remain. To maintain our progress, we should be guided by three fundamental principles in the North-South discussions over the coming months. First, every nation must resist the temptation to solve its own economic problems at the expense of others. We must fashion our domestic policies on the basis of global as well as national needs. Secondly, all nations which bear their fair share of responsibility should benefit from a healthy world economy. And, thirdly, all nations must enter international economic negotiations in a spirit of accommodation.",UNGD
USA,1978,"123.	These principles will not by themselves solve the problems we face. But without their general acceptance, there can be no genuine progress. Adherence to them will prevent critical negotiations from turning into polarizing and self-defeating tests of will.",UNGD
USA,1978,124.	Let me discuss several major issues where the application of these principles can make the difference between success and failure.,UNGD
USA,1978,"125.	First I shall speak of the ""Committee of the Whole"" that is, the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174. One of our most recent collective efforts to address the economic challenges we share was the establishment of that Committee. The Committee has the potential to look at economic issues comprehensively and to identify longer-term priorities. The United States strongly supports that forum. At its meeting in May it made progress in identifying some important areas of agreement between the industrial and the developing countries. Substantive discussions in the Committee had an important impact on the Ministerial Meeting of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, held on 14 and 15 June, and on the Bonn Economic Summit Conference. We of course shared the disappointment of other representatives that a procedural impasse earlier this month interrupted the Committee's work.",UNGD
USA,1978,"126.	Since the September meeting, we have carefully examined the statements made by others on this issue. We have noted in particular statements made by the Chairman to the Committee on 8 September and to the press on 11 September, and have taken into account subsequent consultations. It is now generally agreed that the Committee would not seek to provide specific solutions to problems outstanding in other bodies. Rather, it would achieve agreed conclusions on fundamental or crucial underlying issues, and only to the extent that all members agreed to decide on them.",UNGD
USA,1978,"127.	We are satisfied that on the basis of these statements sufficient procedural agreement now exists to resume substantive work in the manner suggested by the Chairman at the end of the informal consultations on 6 September [see A[33/34, part two, annex A].",UNGD
USA,1978,"128.	I turn now to the question of trade. The spirit which must guide our work in the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174 applies as well to our policies on trade. The developing world is no longer on the periphery of world trade. Increasingly, growth in the developing countries is important to the health of the industrial countries.",UNGD
USA,1978,"129.	Commitment to open trade, however, is extremely fragile. It is tempting for one nation to use trade restrictions to export its economic difficulties. It is often easy to avoid adjustments which are beneficial in the long run, but which in the short run present difficult problems for workers and for industry.",UNGD
USA,1978,"130.	We must be concerned about rising protectionist pressures, but we should also recognize that world trade has expanded remarkably well in recent; years. Despite a deep recession in the early 1970s, we not only avoided the trading wars of the 1930s, but we continued negotiations to liberalize and to improve the world trading system. Our ability to conclude these trade negotiations successfully this year is a critical test of our commitment to an open trading system. An agreement will stimulate production, it will provide jobs, and it will help reduce inflation.",UNGD
USA,1978,"131.	Beyond our efforts to expand trade, the United States will fulfil our commitment to assist developing nations through differential measures, including, where appropriate, special and more favourable treatment. We, in turn, expect those developing countries which can do so to contribute to trade liberalization by improving access to their markets. Improved access will not only benefit the industrial countries; it will be even more important to many developing countries.",UNGD
USA,1978,"132.	Finally, we believe that in trade, as elsewhere, the developing countries should have a voice in determining the policies which affect them. We have encouraged their full involvement in the Geneva multilateral trade negotiations. We urge developing countries, especially those which play a large role in international trade, to participate actively in",UNGD
USA,1978,GATT and in the agreements that result from the Geneva negotiations so that their interests are fully represented.,UNGD
USA,1978,"133.	I turn now to the question of commodities. An essential element of trade for most developing nations is their export of basic commodities. At the fourth session of UNCTAD we agreed to intensify our collective effort to address commodity problems. Progress has not always been as fast as we all would like, but this has generally reflected the technical complexity of commodity issues rather than the lack of political will or good faith. We will continue to work for stabilization agreements and other measures that strengthen commodity markets.",UNGD
USA,1978,134.	Let me affirm that we believe a soundly designed common fund could play a useful role in alleviating commodity problems. A well-structured fund will provide economic benefits to participating countries. We also recognize that the establishment of a fund is of major political importance to the general North-South dialogue.,UNGD
USA,1978,"135.	We will co-operate with others to bring the common fund negotiations to a successful conclusion. Recent consultations have identified a convergence of views on some issues. All agree that a fund could play a useful role in reducing the over-all financial costs of supporting buffer stocks, which effectively stabilize prices.",UNGD
USA,1978,"136.	In addition, there is a growing recognition of the importance of encouraging improved productivity and more effective marketing of many commodities. A separate ""second window"" of the common fund, based on voluntary contributions and operating under agreed guidelines, might be an appropriate mechanism. We are-prepared to negotiate flexibly on this issue, as on others, if there is a similar approach on all sides.",UNGD
USA,1978,"137.	While progress has been made on some issues, important differences still remain. Movement on all sides of the conference table will be necessary. But we are convinced that with mutual accommodation a workable agreement can be achieved.",UNGD
USA,1978,"138.	As with trade, increased resource flows to the developing world must be part of an international system of shared responsibility.",UNGD
USA,1978,"139.	We ought not to think of resource transfers as a sacrifice for donors or a unilateral benefit for recipients They are an economic investment in the future of all countries. They will contribute to global economic growth, greater trade and enhanced prosperity for us all.",UNGD
USA,1978,"140.	My country is committed to increasing our contributions to both multilateral and bilateral development efforts. We have"" done so in the past year: our multilateral commitments increased by 31 per cent and our bilateral programme expanded by 20 per cent. And, because we are determined that United States aid funds will be used effectively, we will concentrate our efforts in countries where programmes are aimed most directly at meeting the essential needs of their people.",UNGD
USA,1978,"141.	The United States believes strongly that a key objective of foreign assistance should be to help meet basic human needs. We recognize that nations will have different development priorities in approaching this goal. Whether emphasis is on enhancing the productivity of the poor, increasing food production, improving health or expanding industry which creates jobs, the critical ingredient in every nation is to have all its citizens—men and women—as active participants in and beneficiaries of their nation's growth.",UNGD
USA,1978,"142.	Finally, we recognize the debt problems that many of the least developed countries face. We will soon have authority from our Congress for retroactive adjustment of certain aid terms which would permit us to help those most in need.",UNGD
USA,1978,"143.	As we work together to promote economic development, we must also ensure an equitable sharing of the world's resources. Four issues demand our immediate attention. Our first urgent priority is ensuring adequate food and stable agricultural prices for all people. Four years have now passed since the World Food Conference, where we agreed on measures we must take for the future.5 But despite our efforts the fundamental problems remain: food production is hardly keeping pace with the growth in population; food deficits in many countries are increasing; and negotiations on grain reserves have dragged on without success. We believe progress must be made.",UNGD
USA,1978,144.	The United States has created a 9-million-ton farmer-held grain reserve. We have proposed to our Congress the establishment of an international emergency wheat reserve of 6 million tons to provide food for emergency needs in developing countries. We intend to maintain our food aid level at a fair share of the target set at the World Food Conference.,UNGD
USA,1978,145.	We will continue to support the activities of international organizations devoted to food production such as the International Fund for Agricultural Development. And we intend to make food aid a more effective tool in support of development.,UNGD
USA,1978,146.	I propose that this Assembly review the world food situation to identify the current obstacles to progress and to restore a sense of urgency in meeting mankind's most basic need. We must not be lulled by good weather and plentiful harvests. Another tragedy is inevitable unless we act now.,UNGD
USA,1978,"147.	Secondly, we must act now to develop new energy resources so that we may avoid a harsh transition to the time when fossil fuels will no longer be plentiful. This task has several dimensions.",UNGD
USA,1978,"148.	There must be an expansion of oil and gas production, and we need to improve our conservation of these energy resources, especially in my country, the United States. The World Bank has expanded its lending to help developing countries increase their fossil fuel supplies. We welcome this, and we also encourage the regional development banks to assist.",UNGD
USA,1978,,UNGD
USA,1978,"149.	The development of nuclear energy will also be central to the future of many countries. We hope the' International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation will provide a consensus on nuclear technologies free from the serious risk of nuclear-weapon proliferation. My Government supports the development of safeguardable nuclear power, including assured nuclear fuel supplies. The developing nations should, of course, participate in the design and management of the institutions which form the basis of an international nuclear energy regime.",UNGD
USA,1978,"150.	Priority attention must be given to the development of renewable energy resources. Many technologies already exist for harnessing solar, wind and geothermal power. All of us can benefit from these technologies, but a special effort should be made to meet the needs of the poorer countries.",UNGD
USA,1978,"151.	Two opportunities now exist for the United Nations to continue to play an important role. The United States supports the proposed United Nations conference on new and renewable sources of energy.  Such a conference could result in a more co-ordinated United Nations energy effort and clearer priorities. It could also provide up-to-date information on renewable energy technology, and examine the role of the private sector in energy development. UNDP might also expand its efforts to help nations assess their own renewable energy possibilities, finance the testing of new technologies and provide training and technical assistance for effective energy management.",UNGD
USA,1978,"152.	The United States is willing to contribute to a major global effort to develop new energy resources. We will intensify our assistance programmes in this area. We will increase domestic research, which can benefit all nations. And we will expand co-operative energy programmes from which we, too, stand to benefit.",UNGD
USA,1978,"153.	Thirdly, we must strive to conclude successfully the negotiations on the law of the sea. At stake is whether that vast expanse of the globe will be an arena of conflict or of co-operation. Considerable progress has been made on a number of issues in these negotiations. These achievements have been obscured, however, by continued stalemate over sea-bed mining. The basis for an equitable solution already exists and is widely accepted. It permits all sides to benefit fully from sea-bed mining, with- private firms as well as an international enterprise being allowed to mine on a competitive basis. A mutually acceptable solution is imperative, and it is, we believe, possible. Time is running out for reaching an agreed solution. Without it, sea-bed mining will inevitably take place, but in the absence of an international agreed framework. That would be less satisfactory than a widely supported international regime.",UNGD
USA,1978,"154.	Fourthly, and finally, there is the critical question of how best to harness technology and science for the benefit of mankind. We hope that the United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development, to be held next year in Vienna, will focus attention on how all countries can contribute their knowledge to global development. It will be particularly important to find ways for developing nations to enhance their capacity to generate, select and apply technology for their own development priorities. We will contribute to the work of the Conference, and we hope to benefit from it.",UNGD
USA,1978,"155.	Furthermore, to help mobilize the technical talents and knowledge of our nation on behalf of the development of others, we intend to establish during the coming year a new foundation for international technical co-operation.",UNGD
USA,1978,"156.	The ultimate purpose of all our policies is the enhancement of human dignity. The rights to food, to shelter, to a decent education, to adequate health—the' rights which lie at the heart of our approach to economic issues—are hollow without political and civil freedoms: freedom from torture and government mistreatment, freedom to worship, to travel and to speak without fear, freedom to participate in the affairs of one's Government. There is no incompatibility among economic, political and civil rights; no choice that must be made among them. They reinforce one another.",UNGD
USA,1978,"157.	We commemorate in this Assembly the thirtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Dag Hammarskjold described the Declaration as a living document. We have a continuing obligation to keep that document alive in our own nations. And as Members of the United Nations we must strengthen the international machinery that serves to promote the full range of human rights, including political and economic rights.",UNGD
USA,1978,"158.	We have made significant progress in the past year. Concern for human rights is more central to international discourse today than ever before. But more needs to be done. This Assembly should review the activities of the various United Nations human rights institutions. We must resolve in this Assembly to make torture alien to the experience of every nation and to conclude an international agreement to outlaw it. We need to ensure that we are doing all we can to end conditions which are tantamount to genocide. And we must ask what more each of us can do to ensure the vitality of the Universal Declaration, to provide amnesty to prisoners of conscience, to ensure due process for all and to advance social justice and equity for our people.",UNGD
USA,1978,"159.	In addition, the plight of one group of individuals, refugees, demands our special compassion. We urge all nations to increase their support for the vital humanitarian work of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.",UNGD
USA,1978,"160.	The refugee problem is not confined to any single region. In Africa alone, some 2 million individuals are now outside their native lands. We must do more to offer them sustenance, security and a realistic hope of resettlement or return to their homelands.",UNGD
USA,1978,"161.	In South-East Asia hundreds of new refugees from Indo-China appear daily, some risking their lives to cross borders, others challenging the sea in every form of vessel. We urgently need greater efforts to provide them with sanctuary. We hope that the High Commissioner will consider convening an international conference in the very near future to seek humane solutions to the desperate plight of these refugees.",UNGD
USA,1978,162.	We propose that consideration also be given at a later date to a general conference on the world-wide refugee problem.,UNGD
USA,1978,163.	Let me now turn to international peace-keeping. Too often the anguish of the uprooted is grim testimony to our collective failure to achieve international peace. War and strife are the enemies of the fundamental rights I have discussed. Today my Government and many of those assembled here are actively pursuing the path of peace in troubled areas of the world.,UNGD
USA,1978,"164.	The accords achieved at Camp David  offer hope that at long last a turning-point has been reached in the Middle East. The agreements achieved between Egypt and Israel, with active American participation, constitute a framework for a comprehensive peace settlement. Much remains to be done in the ensuing stages of negotiations, but a major step has been taken in resolving the difficult issues that lie at the heart of 30 years of Arab-Israel hostility. As negotiations are pursued on the basis of the Camp David framework a dynamic process will be set in motion that can profoundly change attitudes on the issues that remain to be resolved. That process will significantly advance legitimate Arab objectives while protecting Israel's security. It is our hope that the Members of this body will lend their full support to the task of building a just and lasting peace upon this framework.",UNGD
USA,1978,"165.	In his address before Congress on 18 September  President Carter reviewed the main elements of the Camp David agreements. As the President said, our historic position on settlements in occupied territory has remained constant. As he further said, no peace agreement will be either just or secure if it does not 'resolve the problem of the Palestinians in the broadest sense. We believe that the Palestinian people must be assured that they and their descendants can live with dignity and freedom and have the opportunity for economic fulfilment and political expression. The Camp David accords state that the negotiated solution must recognize the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.",UNGD
USA,1978,"166.	The Camp David accords make a solid start towards achieving these goals for the Palestinians in real terms. In the West Bank and Gaza, the framework provides that Israeli occupation shall end and a self-governing authority shall be instituted. This can be achieved within a few months. Thus, for the first time the Palestinians have the prospect of governing themselves within the framework that has been agreed.",UNGD
USA,1978,"167.	The Camp David framework also gives the Palestinians a vital role in shaping their destiny by recognizing them as participants in all aspects of the negotiations that determine their future. The Palestinians will participate in the negotiations to set up their self-governing authority, in those to determine the final status of the West Bank and "" Gaza, and in those leading to a Jordan-Israel peace treaty. Finally, the agreement on the final status of the West Bank",UNGD
USA,1978,and Gaza will be submitted to a vote of representatives of the inhabitants for either ratification or rejection. These steps set in motion a political process of the utmost importance to all Palestinians.,UNGD
USA,1978,"168.	The Camp David accords concentrate on the means by which self-government can be established for the Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza, but there was also clear recognition by all three leaders at Camp David that the problem of the Palestinians living outside these areas must also be addressed. We recognize that this problem has political as well as humanitarian dimensions which must be resolved as an integral part of a durable peace settlement. When the Camp David accords call for the resolution of the Palestinian problem in all its aspects, they acknowledge and embrace that central fact. As the political institutions of self-government take shape, West Bank and Gaza through negotiations among parties, the relationship between those institutions and the Palestinians living outside the area should be defined, including the question of admission of Palestinian refugees to the West Bank and Gaza.",UNGD
USA,1978,"169.	The framework provides for the establishment of a committee to decide on the modalities of admission to the West Bank and Gaza of persons displaced in the 1967 war. For the first time the parties to the conflict, Egypt and Israel, have agreed to work with each other and with other interested parties to establish agreed procedures for a prompt, just and permanent resolution of the refugee problem.",UNGD
USA,1978,"170.	As President Carter stated in his address to Congress, the United States is irrevocably committed to bringing about a satisfactory solution to the problem of the Palestinian refugees. We will play an active role in the resolution of this problem. A solution must reflect the relevant United Nations resolutions relating to the refugees. We urge the international community to support Egypt and Israel in establishing procedures urgently to address this issue in all its aspects. And the international community should contribute to a programme to promote economic development in the West Bank and Gaza, as well as to assist those refugees residing elsewhere.",UNGD
USA,1978,171. We are determined to achieve a fair and just,UNGD
USA,1978,"settlement of the Middle East question in all its parts, and",UNGD
USA,1978,we hope the Palestinian people will seize this historic,UNGD
USA,1978,opportunity. It is our hope that the people of the Middle,UNGD
USA,1978,East will agree that it is imperative to begin the negotiating,UNGD
USA,1978,process now and not to stand still until every last issue is,UNGD
USA,1978,resolved. We urge the other interested parties to join the,UNGD
USA,1978,negotiations without delay.,UNGD
USA,1978,"172. As the Middle East peace process moves forward, it is",UNGD
USA,1978,vital to maintain the effectiveness of the United Nations,UNGD
USA,1978,peace-keeping role there. It is critical that the mandates of,UNGD
USA,1978,the United Nations Peace-keeping Forces in the Golan,UNGD
USA,1978,Heights [UNDOF] and Sinai [UNEF] be renewed this fall.,UNGD
USA,1978,Those Forces have thus far helped all sides avoid renewed,UNGD
USA,1978,hostilities; they must now remain to help achieve a stable,UNGD
USA,1978,peace.,UNGD
USA,1978,173. Let me briefly review several other regional disputes,UNGD
USA,1978,of major importance. ,UNGD
USA,1978,"174. In Lebanon, the fighting and tragic loss of life",UNGD
USA,1978,continue. UNIFIL in southern Lebanon has done much to,UNGD
USA,1978,"stabilize the situation in that part of the country, and we",UNGD
USA,1978,call on all to support this effort to help reassert Lebanese,UNGD
USA,1978,authority. Elsewhere in Lebanon confrontation and tensions,UNGD
USA,1978,continue at a high pitch. President Carter made clear,UNGD
USA,1978,in his address to the joint session of Congress following the,UNGD
USA,1978,"Camp David summit meetings, and again yesterday, his",UNGD
USA,1978,determination to spare no effort to assist in finding a,UNGD
USA,1978,solution to the Lebanese tragedy. As the President said,UNGD
USA,1978,"yesterday, it is time for us to take joint action to call a",UNGD
USA,1978,conference of those who are involved and to try to reach,UNGD
USA,1978,some solution. It may involve a new charter for Lebanon.,UNGD
USA,1978,175. In Namibia the world community faces a fundamental,UNGD
USA,1978,challenge. I will be commenting on this more,UNGD
USA,1978,fully this afternoon in the Security Council. Let me,UNGD
USA,1978,"simply say now that ""the United States is determined to see",UNGD
USA,1978,Namibia achieve independence in accordance with the,UNGD
USA,1978,contact group proposal and Security Council resolution,UNGD
USA,1978,431 (1978). We call upon South Africa to co-operate fully,UNGD
USA,1978,with the United Nations so that this critical opportunity for,UNGD
USA,1978,a peaceful settlement will not be lost.,UNGD
USA,1978,"176. In Rhodesia, time may be running out for the",UNGD
USA,1978,possibilities of diplomacy. But we will continue to work,UNGD
USA,1978,"with the United Kingdom Government, the Governments in",UNGD
USA,1978,"the region and the parties to seek a negotiated solution, We",UNGD
USA,1978,condemn the murder of innocent civilians as a matter of,UNGD
USA,1978,both conscience and reason. The prospects for peace in,UNGD
USA,1978,Rhodesia will diminish if violence increases.,UNGD
USA,1978,"177. On Cyprus, an opportunity now exists to help the",UNGD
USA,1978,two communities narrow their differences and achieve a,UNGD
USA,1978,just and lasting solution to this long-standing problem. The,UNGD
USA,1978,United Nations has done a commendable job of nurturing,UNGD
USA,1978,an atmosphere which should now make possible productive,UNGD
USA,1978,"intercommunal negotiations. To grasp this opportunity, we",UNGD
USA,1978,would welcome and. actively support a renewed effort by,UNGD
USA,1978,Secretary-General Waldheim to help the parties reach,UNGD
USA,1978,"agreement on a sovereign, bicommunal, non-aligned federal",UNGD
USA,1978,Republic of Cyprus which would meet the concerns of the,UNGD
USA,1978,people of Cyprus.,UNGD
USA,1978,"178. In this Hemisphere, we must respond to the agony of",UNGD
USA,1978,those caught up in the violence and bloodshed of,UNGD
USA,1978,Nicaragua. We and several countries in Latin America have,UNGD
USA,1978,offered to assist in the mediation of Nicaragua's internal,UNGD
USA,1978,crisis. It is our hope and expectation that all parties,UNGD
USA,1978,concerned will accept these offers and 'agree to a fair,UNGD
USA,1978,mediation process in which all can have confidence. Only a,UNGD
USA,1978,democratic solution in Nicaragua-not repression or,UNGD
USA,1978,.violence-can lead to an enduring stability and to true,UNGD
USA,1978,peace.,UNGD
USA,1978,179. As we work together to find peaceful resolutions to,UNGD
USA,1978,"the most dangerous regional disputes, we must also seek in",UNGD
USA,1978,this Assembly to strengthen the United Nations peacekeeping,UNGD
USA,1978,capability.,UNGD
USA,1978,,UNGD
USA,1978,180. And while this Organization works to limit violence,UNGD
USA,1978,"among nations, we must not lose sight of the havoc",UNGD
USA,1978,wreaked by those who perpetrate terrorist acts on innocent,UNGD
USA,1978,"persons. No sin(;k' nation, acting alone, can deal adequately",UNGD
USA,1978,with this serious problem. Collective action is essential.,UNGD
USA,1978,,UNGD
USA,1978,,UNGD
USA,1978,,UNGD
USA,1978,181.	We are beginning to make some progress. Last year the General Assembly adopted a significant resolution on aircraft hijacking resolution 32/8. The Joint Statement on International Terrorism adopted on 17 July 1978 at the Bonn Economic Summit Conference  produced a much needed agreement on the harbouring of hijackers. We strongly urge all nations to subscribe to this Statement.,UNGD
USA,1978,182.	The pursuit of peace and security must go beyond resolving conflicts and preventing violence. The security of all is enhanced if nations limit the weapons of war through mutually negotiated arms control agreements.,UNGD
USA,1978,183.	We are engaged with the Soviet Union and other nations in a broad range of arms control negotiations.,UNGD
USA,1978,184.	The conclusion of a strategic arms limitation agreement with the Soviet Union is a fundamental goal of the United States. We hope that we may conclude an agreement as a result of the second series of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks before the end of this year.,UNGD
USA,1978,185.	The United States hopes that early progress can be made in concluding a comprehensive agreement to end the testing of nuclear weapons.,UNGD
USA,1978,"186.	Increased efforts are critically needed to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. It is important to prepare fully for the 1980 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons; to continue to make progress in the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation; and to recognize one of the important achievements of the tenth special session of the General Assembly, devoted to disarmament: the decision by several nuclear Powers to pledge, under specific circumstances, to refrain from use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear States. We suggest that the Security Council take note of these pledges.",UNGD
USA,1978,187.	The United States will also work to ensure compliance with the call in the Declaration of Principles and Programme of Action of the special session on disarmament [see resolution S-10/2] for restraint in the transfer of conventional arms. We are actively discussing with the Soviet Union how our two nations might encourage restraint in consistency with the legitimate right to self-defence and international obligations. We are encouraged by the new initiatives already being taken to promote restraint on a regional basis in Latin America and we stand ready to support similar efforts by countries in other regions.,UNGD
USA,1978,"188.	In conclusion, let me emphasize that on all the issues I have addressed today what we share is greater than how we differ. We share the same small planet. We share human aspirations—for better lives, for greater opportunity, for freedom and security. And because we share a common destiny, we are compelled to resolve our differences.",UNGD
USA,1978,"189.	If we focus on these common interests, we can begin to find the common ground for global progress. We can, as Jean Monnet said, ""put our problems on one side of the table and all of us on the other"".",UNGD
USA,1978,"190.	The measure of our progress will not be whether we achieve all our goals in this generation, for that will surely not be possible. It is whether we can now summon the will to move forward together so that our children may benefit from our efforts and our vision.",UNGD

USA,1979,"We meet in this General Assembly on the threshold of a new decade. It will be a time of complex challenge, a period in which, more than ever, co-operative endeavours among nations are a matter not only of idealism but also of direct self-interest.",UNGD
USA,1979,"39.	The decade now drawing to a close has been characterized by rapid, far-reaching and fundamental change. Awesome technological developments are all about us. The assertion of national independence has reshaped the political geography of our planet. Within nations we see an accelerating rise in individual economic, political and social expectations. The unrelenting hostility of the cold war has given way to a more complex relationship between East and West, with elements of both competition and co-operation. The simple notion of a bipolar world has become obsolete. Increasingly there is a profusion of different systems and allegiances and a diffusion of political and military power. The world economic order is also undergoing inexorable transformations. Many nations formerly among the disadvantaged are now achieving global economic power. Economic interdependence has become a daily reality for the citizens of every nation.",UNGD
USA,1979,"40.	These sweeping changes have for the most part worked in constructive directions, changing lives for the better and opening new possibilities for collective effort and creative diplomacy.",UNGD
USA,1979,"41.	But while these developments demonstrate that progress is possible, they by no means demonstrate that it is inevitable. I say this for two reasons.",UNGD
USA,1979,"42.	First, in a number of areas the pace of current progress is dwarfed by the scope of coming challenges. The next decade will decide whether we have the collective wisdom and the common will to surmount a series of imposing and interrelated problems which must be dealt with in a comprehensive manner.",UNGD
USA,1979,43.	The need to develop new forms of energy will pose a continuing challenge. We have entered the difficult transition from a petroleum economy to one based on other forms of energy.,UNGD
USA,1979,"44.	Even without this added burden, we face an imposing task in providing for the basic needs of people and in narrowing the combustible disparity between wealth and despair. The food shortage facing developing countries, for example, was 12 million tons in 1975. It could be 70 to 85 million tons by 1990, unless productivity rises sharply.",UNGD
USA,1979,45.	We must strike a decent balance between the burgeoning demands of more people for a better life and the inescapable reality of a fragile environment.,UNGD
USA,1979,"46.	Such prospects carry the seeds of future discord. As these seeds ripen, and the growth and spread of weapons continue, regional conflicts become all the more dangerous in their toll of lives and resources and in the heightened risk of wider confrontation.",UNGD
USA,1979,"47.	And despite our emergence from the days of unrelenting hostility, the East-West relationship can deteriorate dangerously whenever one side fails to respect the security interests of the other.",UNGD
USA,1979,"48.	Our ability to meet these tests depends on a second issue: will we confront such challenges together, and benefit together? Or will we let adversity divide us, and thus conquer?",UNGD
USA,1979,49.	I must be frank and say that I am not sure what the answer will be.,UNGD
USA,1979,"50.	There are some reasons for encouragement. In recent years the nations here represented have found it easier, in many different forums, to talk with each other rather than at each other. East and West have entered into the broadest arms control agenda in history. The Soviet Union and the United States have negotiated significant limitations on strategic arms in a treaty that now awaits ratification. North and South have made progress on financial, trade and commodity issues—far more progress than has been acknowledged. Agreement has been reached on a sharp increase in the resources of IMF. Lending by the multilateral development banks has increased. Expanded trade opportunities have been opened by the recently concluded trade negotiations. We have moved ahead on other matters, such as international debt and a common fund for commodities. We should recognize such progress and build on it. We have taken steps as well towards the resolution of some deeply embedded regional disputes.",UNGD
USA,1979,"51.	But I am concerned that there are also factors at work which could reverse this co-operative trend. The severity of the problems we face could drive nations to the pursuit of their own separate advantage at the expense of international co-operation. In times of economic trouble, even relatively prosperous countries find it more difficult to look beyond their internal concerns to meet international needs. Indeed, it is a vivid lesson of history that hardship can breed short-sighted insularity. It can arouse instincts for self-preservation at the expense of others. In such times, the voices of economic nationalism will be raised in all our countries. We must resist them. We must resist, as well, the voices of international confrontation. In a number of international negotiations, political as well as economic, we have worked our way through to the toughest issues involved. We must not react now in frustration, and unleash a spiral of rhetoric which could deepen rather than resolve our divisions.",UNGD
USA,1979,52.	The challenges of the 1980s can be met—if each of us here represented meets the responsibilities which we share.,UNGD
USA,1979,"53.	Our first responsibility is to persist in the search for peace, to reduce both the danger and the destructiveness of war. The future of two regions—the Middle East and southern Africa—depends on specific decisions that will be made in the coming months.",UNGD
USA,1979,54.	We believe that the 26 March Treaty between Egypt and Israel has reduced the dangers inherent in the Arab-Israeli conflict and has laid the foundation for a settlement that can be both durable and just.,UNGD
USA,1979,55.	But the dramatic achievement of peace between Israel and Egypt and the successful implementation of the first phases of the Treaty of peace have not obscured the necessity of moving toward peace between Israel and its other neighbours. Indeed it remains the resolute view of my Government that further progress towards an over-all peace is essential.,UNGD
USA,1979,56.	We know that an ultimate settlement must address the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. The Palestinian question must be resolved in all of its aspects.,UNGD
USA,1979,"57.	As the peace process continues to unfold, it is our deepest desire that representatives of the Palestinian people and the Governments of Jordan and Syria should join in this great quest. ",UNGD
USA,1979,"58.	This is consistent with—indeed it underscores— our unshakable commitment to Israel's security and well-being, now and in the future.",UNGD
USA,1979,59.	None of the parties involved in this difficult negotiation has any illusions that resolving the Palestinian issue will be easy. But the United States is convinced that progress will be made towards that goal.,UNGD
USA,1979,"60.	Preserving the integrity of Lebanon is also critical to peace in the Middle East. There has been a cease-fire in southern Lebanon, the fragility of which is underscored by the events of today. We need not only a temporary cease-fire, but a broader truce. We will be working towards such a goal in our discussions with other interested Governments here at this Assembly. Lebanon has suffered all too much.",UNGD
USA,1979,"61.	The desire for peace is shared by all the peoples of the Middle East. We recognize that there are disagreements about how best to reach that common goal. We believe the course on which we are embarked is the right one, indeed the only one that has shown practical results. We call on all who genuinely seek peace to join in this endeavour.",UNGD
USA,1979,"62.	A step towards peace has been taken as well on the Rhodesian conflict. The parties are now engaged in negotiation towards a solution that could combine true majority rule with essential minority rights. The United Kingdom Government, the Commonwealth nations, and the parties themselves deserve great credit for this new step. The deepening agony of war could be ended by agreement on a fair constitution and new elections, as called for in the final communique issued by the Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries, held at Lusaka from 1 to 7 August",UNGD
USA,1979,"63.	We have made substantial progress in Namibia. But obstacles remain. The contact group is working with the parties concerned to find ways to resolve the few outstanding issues. We do not underestimate the difficulties, but neither should any of us underestimate the opportunities that a settlement would bring for all of southern Africa.",UNGD
USA,1979,"64.	In most negotiations, we can best make progress by stages. A knot can never be untied from the inside. We must begin with the parts that we can grasp, and work our way through to the end of the problem.",UNGD
USA,1979,"65.	History will judge us severely if we let our opportunities for peace slip away. As negotiations proceed, the issues we address become progressively more difficult. But we must not let future fears or ambitions undermine the progress that has been made.",UNGD
USA,1979,"66.	As we work on these and other conflicts; let us also squarely face the fact that our planet is plagued by those who make war on innocents, as we saw just weeks ago in the tragic death of Lord Mountbatten. We must have greater international co-operation to combat the barbarous practices of the terrorist. The United States strongly supports the basic elements of the draft convention against the taking of hostages, the conclusion of this treaty will contribute to a growing consensus that terrorism will not be tolerated, regardless of the political cause its perpetrators claim to pursue.",UNGD
USA,1979,"67.	Finally, the requirement of peace carries with it an international responsibility to limit the spread and accumulation of arms. A particular obligation falls to the largest nuclear Powers—the United States and the Soviet Union—to contain the competition in strategic weapons. The treaty concluded after the second round of SALT can be a major step towards the fulfilment of that obligation.",UNGD
USA,1979,"68.	The goal of strategic stability will be further served if the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States are able to agree on a comprehensive ban, on nuclear tests. As the nuclear super-Powers seek the path towards mutual restraint, all nations must also recognize the direct threat to their security from the spread of nuclear weapons. Developments in recent years can bring new impetus to the non-proliferation effort—including progress in the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation—which can help us to find safer ways to develop nuclear energy for humanity; the strengthening of the IAEA safeguards; the substantial increase in the number of parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons; the entry into force of the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco), which now finally appears within grasp; and the pledge by a number of nuclear Powers, under specific circumstances, to refrain from the use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear States.",UNGD
USA,1979,"69.	But there have also been serious setbacks- further demonstrations of intent to acquire nuclear weapons, in disregard of the inherent dangers for regional and international security. The Second Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, to be held next year, will be a critical time for taking stock—and for redoubling our efforts to make progress on this urgent international priority.",UNGD
USA,1979,"70.	Beyond the search for peace, a second responsibility that we share is to be sensitive to the international consequences of our national economic decisions, and to resist the temptation to solve our economic problems at the expense of others.",UNGD
USA,1979,"71.	The imprudence of economic nationalism has been harshly demonstrated in the past. The world depression a half-century ago was spread, deepened and prolonged by a wave of protectionism. That memory has spurred us towards a new multilateral trade agreement intended to open markets and keep them open, even in a time of economic strain.",UNGD
USA,1979,"72.	Today, let me address one of those issues which most clearly reflects the direct connection between national decisions and global consequences. That issue is energy. In almost no area is the need for common action more apparent or more urgent. It is an issue which now threatens to divide us, economically and politically. In a future of greater scarcity, these divisions could weaken the fabric of international comity which this organisation embodies.",UNGD
USA,1979,"73.	All nations will suffer if all nations do not act responsibly in their consumption, of energy, in its pricing and in its production. Despite a difficult prognosis for our energy future, I believe the basis may exist for progress. ",UNGD
USA,1979,"74.	Until the 1970s modern industrial economies operated on two basic assumptions, which also governed relations between oil importers and exporters. These two assumptions were that oil is cheap, and that supplies are unlimited. Now all nations realize that these assumptions no longer hold.",UNGD
USA,1979,"75.	The commitments made by the major industrial countries at the Tokyo Economic Summit demonstrate this clearly. My Government is taking ambitious action to address the energy problem and is making efforts to exceed these commitments. President Carter has committed the United States not to import more than 8.2 million barrels of oil a day in 1979, and never to exceed the peak level of our imports reached in 1977. Total United States energy research and development this year is $3.2 billion. We are investing $528 million this year—and $600 million next year—in the development and use of solar energy. We are significantly expanding our development of synthetic fuels, to take advantage of the abundant coal and oil shale in our country.",UNGD
USA,1979,"76.	Much of this new energy technology will have application in other countries as well. We will seek to make it available to others under mutually satisfactory conditions. For we recognize that by helping others resolve their energy problems, we help resolve our own.",UNGD
USA,1979,77.	Let me indicate some of the ways in which we are prepared to work with others to meet our common energy needs.,UNGD
USA,1979,78.	We have joined other industrial nations in agreeing to establish a provisional international technology group which will recommend ways to broaden international participation in the commercial development of alternative fuels.,UNGD
USA,1979,79.	I pledged last year that the United States would do more to mobilize its technical talents on behalf of the development of others. I am pleased to report that next month we will establish an Institute for Scientific and Technological Cooperation. This Institute will work for the goals set by the United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development. It will help the people of developing nations to benefit from our technologies. The Institute's Policy Council will include experts from developing nations. Energy development will be among its highest priorities.,UNGD
USA,1979,80.	We will participate actively in preparations for the 1981 United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy.,UNGD
USA,1979,"81.	At the recent Tokyo Economic Summit, the World Bank was invited to take the lead in coordinating our assistance to developing nations in the field of energy. We suggest that the World Bank bring together a group of experts to review the question of energy research, development and training in detail. Specifically, that group could evaluate the work of existing energy research and training centres, both national and international, in developing countries. In addition, it could recommend how current institutions could be strengthened and whether new multilateral ones should be created. We are supporting the expansion of the World Bank's programme for the exploration and development of mineral fuels. The Bank is also considering whether local programmes of development finance are adequate to support the rapid application of solar, small hydroelectric and other renewable energy technologies in developing nations.",UNGD
USA,1979,82.	The Inter-American Development Bank has proposed creation of a facility to provide political risk insurance and loan guarantees for private investment in energy and minerals projects in its region. This could be an effective means of stimulating energy development there. We are willing to pursue with the Bank its initiative and work with other countries to develop an acceptable proposal.,UNGD
USA,1979,"83.	As the industrial countries make serious efforts to restrict oil demand, and to help the developing countries meet their energy challenges, the question increasingly becomes whether the oil-producing nations are prepared to stabilize prices, and, to the extent it is within their control, ensure adequate supplies. A failure to do so will continue to have harsh consequences for the world economy, especially the poorer nations.",UNGD
USA,1979,"84.	We understand the natural desire of oil-exporting nations to husband this valuable resource for future generations. And we accept the fact that oil prices must reflect not only the strength of demand, but also the long-term scarcity of supply—so long as scarcity is never contrived to manipulate price,",UNGD
USA,1979,"85.	But oil producers must understand that there is a limit to what the economies of the oil-consuming nations, and the global economy, can sustain.",UNGD
USA,1979,86.	We must all proceed with a responsible recognition that our national energy decisions will have profound global effects—and will return either to haunt or to help their makers.,UNGD
USA,1979,"87.	A third common responsibility is an intensified commitment to help improve the lives of our fellow human beings—to provide the necessities of life, to afford the chance to progress, to assure a voice in decisions which will determine their future.",UNGD
USA,1979,"88.	We have made progress in the field of human rights, but we must do more. In the past year, some nations have taken steps to restore legal protections and democratic institutions. And we have seen the inauguration of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, the forceful call of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] for the creation of regional human rights institutions on the continent of Africa, and the activation of UNESCO's human rights procedures. The growing concern for human rights is undeniable. Yet the sad truth is that, even as we sit here today, men and women face torture, death and oppression for daring to exercise rights set forth in the Charter of this body three decades ago. Our joint challenge is to advance the aspirations of all peoples for human dignity.",UNGD
USA,1979,"89.	Our commitment must be to economic as well as political and social rights—for all are indispensable to human dignity. Improvements in economic well-being, opportunities for participation in the political process, and a growing sense of both economic and political equity can do much to defuse the grievances which can lead to national convulsions and international tensions.",UNGD
USA,1979,"90.	To meet this commitment to a better life for all peoples, we must each strive to move the North-South dialogue beyond grand themes and on to specific cases—to priority areas in which practical development goals can be met. Let me discuss in this connexion our efforts towards a goal we should adopt as a matter of simple humanity—that by the end of this century no person on this bountiful earth should have to go hungry.",UNGD
USA,1979,"91.	Last year, I noted that we must not be lulled by good weather and plentiful harvests into losing our sense of urgency. Since then, poor harvests in a number of countries have substantially increased the international demand for food. This situation underscores the need to accumulate adequate stocks to support world food security. I assure Members that the United States will do all it can to prevent a global food crisis. The American harvest this year will be of record size. We have removed all restrictions on wheat production for next year. We have established farmer-owned grain reserves which, through the accumulation and release of stocks, have helped stabilize supplies.",UNGD
USA,1979,"92.	An international wheat agreement still eludes our grasp. We should not abandon this goal. But we should move immediately to complete negotiations for a new food aid convention. The World Food Council has urged an agreement by mid-1980. We support that recommendation. In the meantime, we are already implementing the higher food aid pledge the convention would entail.",UNGD
USA,1979,"93.	At the same time, major emphasis must be placed on improving global food production. Over half of American direct development aid is now devoted to agriculture. We will continue working to improve the yields of major food crops, to preserve croplands and to expand research on ways to increase the production of traditional and new crops, especially those grown by poor farmers.",UNGD
USA,1979,94.	These efforts have received effective support from the International Agricultural Research Centres. We support proposals to double the resources contributed to those centres and intend to increase our contribution. We hope additional countries will become contributors.,UNGD
USA,1979,"95.	We must be aware; however, that in the long run these efforts could be vitiated if the world's population growth is not slowed. Half the couples of child-bearing age still do not have adequate access to family planning services. We must strive to make family planning services—along with other elements of basic health care, adequate food supplies and clean water— available to all as rapidly as we can.",UNGD
USA,1979,"96.	And in the short run, we must be prepared to meet emergency needs wherever famine afflicts humanity or refugees seek haven—in Africa, in Latin America, in South-East Asia or elsewhere.",UNGD
USA,1979,97.	The proposal made by Vice-President Mondaleat the Geneva Meeting for a refugee resettlement fund reflects our belief that the international community should deal on a global basis with a global and grave refugee crisis. We urge broad participation in this fund.,UNGD
USA,1979,"98.	Vigorous and large-scale international action is required to bring relief to the starving in Kampuchea, now facing one of the great human tragedies of modern times. Tens of thousands of sick and hungry Khmer are already pressing on Thailand's border. Hundreds of thousands may soon follow them. Even more widespread famine and disease are in prospect, especially in view of recent reports of intensified fighting. To avert unthinkable catastrophe» an international programme of humanitarian relief must be established in Kampuchea as soon as possible. International organizations must be able to bring a co-ordinated, massive and adequately monitored programme of emergency relief to all needy Khmer. We would endorse such an effort.",UNGD
USA,1979,"99.	The food crisis in Kampuchea promises both to multiply the flow of refugees and to take a terrible toil among those who cannot escape. The flood of refugees from Viet Nam, Laos and Kampuchea already has brought great suffering to hundreds of thousands of innocent people, as well as imposed heavy burdens on countries of first asylum.",UNGD
USA,1979,100.	The international community has begun to respond. But humanitarian steps are not enough. The community of nations must make a more active effort to restore peace to the region and to resolve by non- military means the problems that developments in Indo-China have carried in their wake. They pose a threat to the stability of the region as a whole.,UNGD
USA,1979,101.	I believe we can meet the challenges before us. But let us not misjudge their magnitude.,UNGD
USA,1979,"102.	Resolution of regional disputes and placing new limits on the instruments of war will require new acts of national and international will. The 1980s could portend a prolonged energy crisis. It could be a decade of widespread famine. Unless the swelling deficits of developing countries can be managed, many of their economies may stagnate and some could be threatened with collapse. Global problems like these require global solutions.",UNGD
USA,1979,"103.	This Assembly will decide whether to launch a new round of negotiations on economic co-operation for development. Let me state today that the United States would participate, in the Committee of the Whole Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174, in consultations to decide on the most effective way of conducting such negotiations.",UNGD
USA,1979,"104.	If new global negotiations are to succeed, the participants must be realistic about each other's political and economic capabilities. We must assign priority to those issues on which concrete results are possible, and we should avoid duplicating the work of existing institutions. In this way, the negotiations could help build a global consensus for action.",UNGD
USA,1979,"105.	Many of the issues I have addressed are already prominent on the agenda of the United Nations. The need for co-operation in addressing them requires that we continue to strengthen this institution. Financial, procedural and management reforms are urgently necessary. As a first step, we urge that the Secretary-General's recommendations, now adopted by this Assembly, be fully implemented.",UNGD
USA,1979,106.	The urgency of the requirements I have described calls for something more on the part of all Members of the United Nations.,UNGD
USA,1979,"107.	The distinctions between North and South, like those between East and West, reflect differing interests. They have a role in defining the issues and in clarifying our choices. But we must commit ourselves to finding areas where our interests converge.",UNGD
USA,1979,"108.	Each of us has our special values to be nurtured, our particular goals to be served, and I do not suggest it can or should be otherwise. The United States believes in a world of diversity.",UNGD
USA,1979,"109.	But let us resolve—here, at this Assembly — to find in our common needs and common humanity a renewed dedication to the search for common ground.",UNGD
USA,1980,"Mr. President, I congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. It is a recognition of your extraordinary diplomatic skills, but, more important, your election is a tribute to your country and to its contribution to international cooperation and understanding.",UNGD
USA,1980,"52.	On behalf of the United States delegation to this Assembly, I come here today to express anew the United States commitment to the United Nations. I come also to express our hopes for its future at a moment when the world is deeply troubled by tension and uncertainty. Peace is threatened by smouldering regional conflicts and by assaults of the strong upon the weak. Nations large and small are buffeted by steeply rising oil prices and serious economic strains. Within many countries poverty and oppression form an explosive combination.",UNGD
USA,1980,"53.	A few weeks ago I spoke to this Assembly about the international economy.  I stressed the obligation of nations to cooperate in facing world economic problems: payments imbalances, energy inflation, slowed growth in many developing countries, the spectres of environmental decay and even famine.",UNGD
USA,1980,"54.	Our inability to reach a consensus on procedures for global negotiations is a pause in the process, not a failure in our objectives. I do not mean to say that the differences that have kept us from finding a formula for global negotiations can be glossed over. They are real. They are substantive. But we are prepared to use the span of this General Assembly to continue discussions that can lead to procedures, to an agenda and to a negotiating structure that will foster broad agreement among all the nations here represented.",UNGD
USA,1980,"55.	Today I want to look beyond economic problems to the one condition that is a prerequisite for all material progress: peace. If we truly care about building a world in which peace and justice prevail, the world's nations, and this Organization, cannot ignore certain political and legal obligations also—obligations every bit as compelling as the economic obligations I spoke of earlier.",UNGD
USA,1980,"56.	These responsibilities are not new. They are proclaimed in the Charter of the United Nations. But dangerous new circumstances require that we stress them anew, lest we betray the very purpose the United Nations is designed to serve.",UNGD
USA,1980,"57.	Our first obligation is to refrain from aggression and to deal with it vigorously. Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations provides for ""the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace"". Article 2 prohibits ""the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State"".",UNGD
USA,1980,"58.	Accordingly, the United Nations must confront the continuing assault upon Afghanistan. I raise this issue not to set off a rhetorical exchange, not in the interest of polemics, but in the interest of peace.",UNGD
USA,1980,"59.	Today, more than 1 million refugees attest to the human toll of the violence in Afghanistan. And more is at stake than the independence of one country. If this assault continues, the independence and integrity of every small defenceless nation will be called into question.",UNGD
USA,1980,"60.	Last January, at an emergency special session, this Assembly condemned by a large majority the assault upon Afghanistan. We strongly believe that at the thirty-fifth session also the General Assembly must work under the Charter to reinforce the principles of the United Nations. We must work for a total withdrawal of Soviet troops and a political settlement. We must support the principles of non-intervention, self-determination and non-alignment for Afghanistan.",UNGD
USA,1980,"61.	In Kampuchea as well, armed aggression continues. We welcome reports of some progress made under th4 leadership of the United Nations Secretary General and international organizations in relieving the conditions of deprivation and disease so prevalent a year ago. The threat of renewed starvation requires significant further contribution from the international community.",UNGD
USA,1980,"62.	Despite some improvement in Kampuchea's desperate human situation, no progress whatsoever has been made towards securing the withdrawal of occupying Vietnamese forces and the restoration of self-determination to the Kampuchea people, as called for in last year's resolution on Kampuchea, sponsored by the nonaligned nations. We strongly support the basis for a settlement, including the concept of an international conference, contained in that resolution, which was passed by a large majority.",UNGD
USA,1980,"63.	Above all, let us keep in mind two basic purposes for which this body exists: to oppose armed aggression and to assuage its consequences. No achievement could be more important to the future influence and effectiveness of the United Nations. No failure could be more damaging than a failure to deal firmly with these issues.",UNGD
USA,1980,"64.	Our second obligation, proclaimed by our Charter, is to settle international disputes by peaceful means. Achieving this goal remains urgently important in two key regions: the Middle East and southern Africa.",UNGD
USA,1980,"65.	In the Middle East, the United States is committed to a comprehensive peace—an enduring peace based on the principles of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). We are determined to pursue to a successful conclusion the peace process begun at Camp David two years ago this month.  Already that process has achieved something once thought impossible: peace between Egypt and Israel. Now the negotiations are focused upon, a second goal: taking a significant first step towards resolving the Palestinian problem. The current autonomy talks have as their goal arriving at interim arrangements to establish full autonomy for the people of the West Bank and Gaza. After that, the process will proceed to negotiations which will determine the final status of those areas.",UNGD
USA,1980,"66.	As we seek to resolve this conflict, we are committed to finding a solution to the Palestinian problem in all its aspects and, at the same time, to permanent security for the State of Israel. We have no illusions about the difficulties of this quest. We are dealing with a conflict of long duration and intense feelings. There can be no short cuts.",UNGD
USA,1980,"67.	So today I call on all members of this Assembly to lend their support to these negotiations. Camp David has proved so far, and remains for the future, the most hopeful and productive avenue to peace in the Middle East. There is no alternative to negotiations except further conflict. Let us remember that differences are rivers to be crossed, not reasons to turn back.",UNGD
USA,1980,"68.	That persistence can bear fruit—that negotiations can yield peace—has been reaffirmed in recent months in southern Africa. Through arduous negotiations, the new nation of Zimbabwe has been born in peace. Today we have reason to celebrate not only this accomplishment, but also the way in which nations worked together to achieve it. And for the future, the Zimbabwe settlement offers hope—and a model—for peaceful settlements in southern Africa and elsewhere.",UNGD
USA,1980,"69.	The United States will continue its strong efforts to advance the United Nations plan for Namibia. There are no major substantive issues left to be resolved. I am convinced that the United Nations plan would be implemented fairly. All that remains is for South Africa to act in its own interest, in the interest of peace in the region, and in the interest of the Namibian people: to accept implementation of the United Nations settlement. If that does not happen soon, this chance for peace could be lost, and we would face a bitter future of protracted conflict and tragic human suffering.",UNGD
USA,1980,"70.	The settlement in Zimbabwe can also provide a precedent for peaceful change in South Africa. We will continue to urge the Government of South Africa to abandon the repugnant policy of apartheid. We consider it urgent that talks among representative leaders begin on the issue of peaceful, orderly change in South Africa—while there is still time.",UNGD
USA,1980,"71.	We must continue our search for peace and restoration of respect for international law in other parts of the world as well. In Lebanon, in Cyprus and elsewhere, we will lend our full support to the peace making and peacekeeping efforts of the United Nations.",UNGD
USA,1980,"72.	And although the holding of American hostages in Iran is not an item on the agenda of this Assembly, it remains a matter of extreme urgency that this tragic impasse be resolved—resolved in a way that strengthens peace and restores respect for international law. The continuing situation in Iran contributes to uncertainty about security and stability in Southwest Asia. The security of Iran itself and the stability of the area depend on a united, strong and independent Iran living at peace with its neighbours.",UNGD
USA,1980,"73.	With the end of the former regime and the death of the late Shah, a chapter in Iran's history has closed. As a new chapter opens, we emphasize that we recognize the reality of the Iranian revolution, and we respect the right of the Iranian people to choose their own form of government without intervention of any kind. With the emergence of a new constitution and governmental structure and the gradual consolidation of authority, the Islamic Republic of Iran can assume its obligations and independent role in this community of nations.",UNGD
USA,1980,"74.	An indispensable step will be the safe return to their families of the American hostages in Iran. Throughout the 324 days of their captivity, the Member States and institutions of the United Nations have expressed their concern for the hostages in numberless ways and channels. With their safe release, repeatedly called for by the Security Council and the International Court of Justice, Iran could end its isolation from those nations that live in accordance with international law, and sanctions would be terminated.",UNGD
USA,1980,"75.	Today I urge the nation of Iran, its Parliament, and its people also, to consider the human face of the hostage problem. These innocent people and their families have experienced acute suffering. I ask this community of nations to join us in urging that their ordeal be brought to a safe, honourable and prompt end. We also know that in Iran, as in the United States, there are deep feelings as a result of grievances and suffering perceived in the past. We are prepared to do our part in resolving fairly the issues between us. The Iranian Parliament has announced that it will name a commission to deal with the hostage question. We hope that this positive step will bring the Government of Iran closer to a decision on release of the hostages.",UNGD
USA,1980,"76.	The United States shares many common values with the people of Iran. When the safe return of all the hostages to their families is assured, we are prepared to deal on a basis of mutual respect and equality with all the outstanding issues and misunderstandings between Iran and the United States and to reach understandings on the principles which will govern our relationship.",UNGD
USA,1980,"77.	As we look to the future, 1 urge the United Nations, as soon as possible, to take firm and effective measures to counter the global menace of attacks upon diplomats and others. The danger it poses to civilized international life is growing; no institution of peace can afford to ignore it. For our part, the United States seeks peace with all nations. Whether it be with Iran or with the Soviet Union, we are eager to reduce tensions and to restore productive relations as soon as their actions allow.",UNGD
USA,1980,"78.	In all cases our policies will reflect our commitment to non-interference in the internal affairs of other nations. As the President of the United States, Mr. Carter, has affirmed, we shall not interfere in Poland's affairs and we expect that others will also respect the right of the Polish nation to resolve its own problems in its own way.",UNGD
USA,1980,"79.	Another obligation of nations is the control and limitation of arms. A period of heightened tension in the world makes this obligation more difficult to fulfil, but also more urgently important.",UNGD
USA,1980,"80.	For that reason, let me underscore anew today the commitment of my Government to arms control, to practical measures that contribute to world peace and enhance international stability. President Carter voiced this basic commitment when lie was sworn in as President in January 1977. It remains equally valid today.",UNGD
USA,1980,"81.	Let me give several concrete illustrations of that commitment. Some of the arms control efforts I shall mention involve active participation by the United Nations; others involve negotiations outside the United Nations framework. But all are of intense concern to the international community, for an unrestrained arms race would darken the horizon for all humanity.",UNGD
USA,1980,"82.	First, it is President Carter's intention to move forward as speedily as possible towards ratification of the SALT II Treaty.  Accordingly, the President intends to consult with the leadership of the United States Senate soon after the election with a view to resuming the ratification process as soon as is feasible. We consider it of cardinal importance to ratify SALT II and to move forward with the SALT process. The Soviet Union, however, must recognize that for many Americans recent Soviet actions have called into question the Soviet Union's commitment to international peace and cooperation. Accordingly, we call upon the Soviet Union to act in ways that will enhance, not damage, the prospects for SALT II and for other arms control efforts.",UNGD
USA,1980,"83.	Secondly, we are committed to the pursuit of meaningful and equal limitations on theatre nuclear forces in the framework of the SALT III negotiations. We are ready to begin talks with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union this week to discuss this subject and to seek agreement on the arrangements for beginning these talks promptly.",UNGD
USA,1980,"84.	Thirdly, we are committed to seeking an effective and verifiable comprehensive test ban treaty. Substantial progress has been made towards this goal and we are determined to continue pursuing these efforts vigorously.",UNGD
USA,1980,"85.	Fourthly, the United States is committed m the Vienna talks to achieving mutual and balanced force reductions and limitations to diminish the risks inherent in the massive presence of military forces in central Europe.",UNGD
USA,1980,"86.	Fifthly, we are prepared to develop further the security aspects of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. If the international situation permits and if there is balanced progress in all areas, including the human rights area, at the second review session of the Conference, to be held at Madrid in November, we are prepared to consider a post Madrid European conference of the signatory States to the Final Act of the Conference on developing militarily significant confidence-building measures.",UNGD
USA,1980,"87.	Sixthly, we support the effort of the newly expanded Committee on Disarmament to develop the provisions of an international convention on radiological weapons We also support its work towards a comprehensive ban on chemical weapons and we continue to pursue our bilateral negotiations with the Soviet Union on an effective prohibition against chemical weapons.",UNGD
USA,1980,"88.	Finally, the further spread of nuclear weapons would constitute a serious threat to international peace and security. We firmly support efforts, therefore, to reduce the risk of nuclear proliferation. The Treaty on the Non Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is a cornerstone of those efforts; we strongly urge non-parties to embrace the Treaty, for it enhances the security of all nations, nuclear weapon and nonnuclear weapon States alike. At the second Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons there was unanimous agreement on the fundamental soundness of the Treaty and the desirability of universal adherence to it. For those nonnuclear weapon States that have not joined the Treaty, we attach particular importance to the goal of achieving comprehensive, full scope international safeguards coverage. We believe that acceptance of such coverage should become a condition of new nuclear supply commitments to such States. We shall continue to work for a world in which all nations can share in the peaceful use of nuclear energy without the danger of spreading nuclear weapons.",UNGD
USA,1980,"89.	Before I leave this subject, let me emphasize our deep concern over another arms control matter. If arms control is to be successful, agreements must be fully honoured. Questions such as those raised by persistent reports that chemical weapons have been used in Afghanistan, Laos and Kampuchea cannot be ignored by the international community. To do so would undermine both arms control and international law. The United States, therefore, welcomes the emphasis placed by the Committee on Disarmament at its most recent session on the need for international efforts to determine the facts behind those reports. We believe that an impartial investigation into those reports could most appropriately be launched under the auspices of the United Nations.",UNGD
USA,1980,"90.	Important as they are, the obligations I have mentioned by no means exhaust the responsibilities which rest upon us as nations, and as a community of nations, if we are to secure peace. By peace, I do not mean the fragile, artificial stability that comes with repression of a people by its Government; I mean the true stability of societies that are at peace with themselves because the rights of their citizens are protected and nurtured.",UNGD
USA,1980,91.	So let me close by underscoring another obligation of nations: our obligation to uphold human rights and to concern ourselves compassionately with fundamental human needs.,UNGD
USA,1980,"92.	In the Universal Declaration of Human Rights the community of nations has nobly defined the concepts of human rights and human dignity, just as in the Charter of the United Nations we have outlined the precepts of peaceful cooperation.",UNGD
USA,1980,"93.	The failure of nations to live up to those human rights obligations is a continuing tragedy, made painfully manifest in the waves of refugees now sweeping across the world.",UNGD
USA,1980,"94.	Those suffering people present a dramatic challenge to the international community represented by This Assembly. Over the past five years the United States has welcomed more than 600,000 refugees—from Africa, from Asia, from Europe, from the Middle Last and from the western hemisphere. In the past five months alone we have received more than 120,000 people driven from Cuba to our shores—an influx which has presented extraordinary challenges to our resources.",UNGD
USA,1980,"95.	In recognition of the human need implicit in this worldwide wave of refugees, President Carter has made known the intention of the United States to accept an additional 217,000 refugees over the next year.",UNGD
USA,1980,"96.	Our country, of course, is only one of the many which have welcomed and helped refugees. More than 1 million Afghan refugees have fled to Pakistan; 400,000 Indo Chinese are in Thailand. More than 3 million are homeless in sub-Saharan Africa. Clearly this is a global problem; it requires a global response.",UNGD
USA,1980,"97.	The refugee resettlement efforts agreed upon at Geneva last year [see A/35/12, para. 6] demand our energy and our generosity. We must strengthen the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.",UNGD
USA,1980,"98.	The humanitarian programmes of the United Nations and of the other agencies require a renewed commitment from all of us to their support and to their strengthening. But ultimately this human tragedy can be dealt with only by removing its root causes: by overcoming poverty, by ending the abuse of human rights within nations and by establishing peace among nations so that no person need be forced to flee from home and country.",UNGD
USA,1980,"99.	This is why my nation supports the growth of democracy and personal freedom in the Americas, in Africa and in every region of the world. Achieving these ultimate purposes remains a supreme challenge for the United Nations. Making progress towards them must be the work of this thirty fifth session of the General Assembly.",UNGD
USA,1980,"100. Let us not ignore the facts. Ours is a moment of worldwide economic difficulty and a time of tension between great Powers. At such moments, peaceful cooperation becomes even more difficult than usual. At such moments, our obligations as members of this Assembly of nations take on new importance. At such times, when a cloud of troubling events darkens our aspirations to ultimate peace, we can light our path by adhering faithfully to our Charter, to the international law that binds us, to the standards of international conduct that protect us.",UNGD
USA,1980,101.	Let us hope that the light we generate by doing so will dispel the clouds of tension and discord that darken the world today.,UNGD
USA,1980,"102.	The United States will do its part. We will live up to our obligations to oppose aggression, to build peace, to limit arms, to support human rights and to foster economic justice, for us and for other nations, these endeavours can immeasurably improve life on earth and build the just and lasting peace for which all our peoples yearn.",UNGD
USA,1981,"The United Nations, this parliament of man, offers us a unique opportunity to examine the human condition. We are each called upon to declare our national purposes. We are all obligated to address those problems that obstruct the vision of the Charter.",UNGD
USA,1981,158.	Let us begin with the vision. The Charter of the United Nations reflects cherished dreams of a world distinguished by peaceful change and the resolution of international disputes without resort to force.,UNGD
USA,1981,"159.	The United States believes in these dreams. They offer the best chance of justice and progress for all mankind. They promise a world hospitable to the values of our own society, including a certain idea of man as a creative and responsible individual, democracy and the rule of law.",UNGD
USA,1981,160.	The ideals of the United Nations are therefore also American ideals. The Charter embodies American principles. It will always be a major objective of our statecraft to make the United Nations an instrument of peace.,UNGD
USA,1981,161.	We all know that the realization of our dreams cannot depend on hope alone. Obstacles to progress must be overcome through united efforts. The threats to peace are many; suspicions persist; and the price of inaction is great. Truly we face a most difficult agenda.,UNGD
USA,1981,"162.	As 1 make these comments I am reminded that an observer once said of this annual debate: ""Every year ... a great and sacred orator . . . preaches before the assembly of nations a solemn sermon on the text of the Charter"". Today, however, 1 would like to focus instead on an issue of compelling interest: international development.",UNGD
USA,1981,"163.	International development reflects the worldwide search for economic progress, social justice and human dignity. Short of war itself, no other issue before us will affect more people, for good or ill, than this search. And peace itself cannot be truly secured if the aspirations of mankind to a better life are frustrated.",UNGD
USA,1981,164.	Development is therefore an enduring issue. It has preoccupied the United Nations from the beginning. It will survive the agenda of this Assembly and every Assembly far into the future. And although great progress has been made we face today a crucial choice of strategy that will dramatically affect the prospects for future success.,UNGD
USA,1981,"165.	Since the Second World War the progress of development has been uneven but none the less widespread. Enormous economic growth has been registered: for example, in the last three decades average incomes have actually doubled. There have also been great advances in health. Life expectancy has increased dramatically even in the poorest countries and infant mortality has been reduced.",UNGD
USA,1981,"166.	This experience, however, has not been fully shared by all countries and the prospect for the future is now clouded by recent trends.",UNGD
USA,1981,"167.	The pattern of increasing economic growth, critical for development, has been slowed by inflation, high energy prices, severe balance of payments problems, heavy debt and slower growth of markets. Political turmoil and instability have diverted precious resources into arms and conflict. The necessary synthesis of traditional values and modernization, never easy to achieve, has grown more difficult under the impact of accelerating change.",UNGD
USA,1981,"168.	Let us dispense with illusions. We must choose today between two futures: a future of sustainable growth, an expansion of world trade and a reduction of poverty; and a future of economic stagnation, rising protectionism and the spread of poverty. As the World Bank has put it, ""By the end of the century, the difference between the two cases amounts to some 220 million more absolutely poor people"" .",UNGD
USA,1981,"169.	Clearly, our task is to give a fresh Impetus to development by devising a new strategy for growth. Such a strategy begins by recognizing the highly Complex and difficult situation we face.	'",UNGD
USA,1981,"170.	The poorest developing countries require longterm and generous concessional aid from developed and other developing countries to raise productivity through broadly based education and training, improvements in health and nutrition and better infrastructure. They also need sound economic policies, particularly in the agricultural sector. Ultimately, the objective must be to involve them in the international economic system, thereby strengthening opportunities and incentives for self-sustaining growth.",UNGD
USA,1981,"171.	The middle tier developing countries have made significant progress. Nevertheless, they still suffer from widespread poverty. They are also acutely vulnerable to any economic downturn, especially in volatile commodity markets, because of their narrow range of exports. These countries need foreign capital and assistance in developing the experience and creditworthiness to borrow on international capital markets. Technical support and manpower training are important to ensure that their populations are both productive and competitive. They also need an open international trading system to encourage export development.",UNGD
USA,1981,"172.	The more advanced of the developing countries are able to maintain living standards and economic performance comparable to what some of today's industrialized countries achieved less than a generation ago. Their further development is sustained best by a strong international economy with an open capital and trading system. They must be able to pursue national policies that take advantage of the international opportunities and foster domestic adjustment. These countries also play a key role in helping poorer nations, both directly and as policy models.",UNGD
USA,1981,173.	The capital surplus oil exporting countries need a stable and prosperous international market for their oil exports and a favorable environment in which to invest their financial assets and to develop their domestic economies. The international system must continue to evolve to reflect the growing importance of these countries as they assume increasing responsibility for the management of that system and for assisting poorer nations.,UNGD
USA,1981,"174.	Finally, the industrialized countries are today suffering from low rates of growth and high rates of inflation. They are trying to increase savings and investment in order to create employment, improve the environment, eliminate pockets of poverty and adjust to the changing competitiveness of their exports. They must sell more abroad to pay for the increased cost of imported energy.",UNGD
USA,1981,"175.	In a slowly growing world these complex and diverse requirements would become potent sources of conflict. But the struggle for the world product can be avoided. The international economy can help all countries to achieve their objectives through a strategy of growth which creates the resources and the employment needed for progress. This cannot be the task of a single nation. As die report of the Independent Commission on International Development Issues, chaired by Willy Brandt, has pointed out: ""Above all, the achievement of economic growth in one country depends increasingly on the performance of others"".4",UNGD
USA,1981,"176.	It is on this view of a differentiated and interdependent world that we must build a new strategy for growth; but our strategy must also be informed by the lessons of the past. Such lessons, extracted from hard experience, offer the basis for principles to guide us through these austere and difficult times.",UNGD
USA,1981,"177.	First, development is facilitated by an open international trading system. Developed and developing countries together face the challenge of strengthening GATT and the international trading system to create mutual export opportunities for all.",UNGD
USA,1981,"178.	Today the trading system is under enormous stress—rising protectionist pressures, new and subtle types of import barriers, restrictive bilateral arrangements, export subsidies and investment policies which distort trade. These are especially troublesome in a period of slow growth. Unless they are reduced or eliminated the international trading system will be seriously weakened. Such a setback to the world economy would inflict the most suffering on the developing countries.",UNGD
USA,1981,179.	The industrialized countries have a special responsibility to work for a more open trading system with improved rules. We also look to the more successful developing countries to play a fuller role in strengthening the trading system. It will be difficult for each of our countries individually to open markets further unless we are committed to doing so collectively.,UNGD
USA,1981,"180.	For our part, the United States has long supported open markets. Despite current complications, America remains a strong advocate of free trade. Although our gross national product is only one third of the Western industrialized group's total, the United States imports roughly one half of all manufactured goods exported by developing countries. Earnings of developing countries not members of OPEC from exports to the United States amount to some $60 billion more than double the foreign aid coming from all Western developed countries.",UNGD
USA,1981,181.	We call upon all members of the international community to join in resisting the growth of protectionism. Developing nations must have the greatest possible opportunity to sell their commodities and manufactured products. Let us also work together to achieve a successful conclusion of the multi-fibre agreement.,UNGD
USA,1981,182.	A dynamic and successful trading system requires a smoothly functioning international financial system. We must therefore continue to work with other countries to encourage their support for IMF and their constructive participation in the Bind's programs to facilitate adjustment. We will continue to cooperate with our developing country colleagues to strengthen the Fund. We share the view that the responsibilities of the developing countries should be increased to keep pace with their growing economic importance.,UNGD
USA,1981,"183.	Secondly, foreign assistance coupled with sound domestic policy and self-help can facilitate the development process. The United States has long believed in assistance as an effective tool in helping to promote development. Over the last three decades the United States has given more than $130 billion in concessional assistance; over the last decade alone the total has exceeded $50 billion; In 1980 the American people provided $7.1 billion, almost twice as much as any other donor.",UNGD
USA,1981,184.	The United States has also been a major force in the creation and support of the multilateral development banks. The banks represent an important and to many countries an essential feature in the international financial system. In the last five years the United States has authorized and appropriated an average of $1.5 billion per year for support of the multilateral banks. There is no question about their value as development institutions. As intermediaries they help to mobilize the resources of international capital markets to lend to developing countries. The banks' loans for key projects are important catalysts for productive domestic and foreign private investment.,UNGD
USA,1981,"185.	We recognize that many of the poorer developing countries must continue to rely heavily on concessional assistance for some time to come. Moreover, certain kinds of vital development programs will not pay the quick and direct financial returns needed to attract private capital. For this reason a continuing bilateral assistance program and continuing support for the multilateral banks will be essential.",UNGD
USA,1981,"186.	Given today's economic conditions and the limitation on aid budgets in many countries, it is especially important that concessional assistance be utilized as effectively as possible; that it focus on countries which need it most and which use it best; and that it be a more effective catalyst for mobilizing other foreign and domestic resources. We must also recognize that a strategy for growth that depends on a massive increase in the transfer of resources from the developed to the developing countries is simply unrealistic. *",UNGD
USA,1981,"187.	Thirdly, regional cooperation and bilateral consultations can be effective in promoting development. The United States is working with other regional States to promote economic progress in the Caribbean area. We are convinced that the example of the recent multinational cooperation in the case of Jamaica and the broader Caribbean Basin initiative holds promise for other regions.",UNGD
USA,1981,188.	We are already committed to a close working relationship with the Association of SouthEast Asian Nations [ASEAN]. We have benefited considerably from a better understanding of ASEAN's views on multilateral issues and on ways to strengthen our bilateral commercial ties. The United StatesASEAN Business Council is a model of how our private sectors can work together for mutual benefit.,UNGD
USA,1981,"189.	In Africa we look forward to a close working relationship with the Economic Community of West African States as it attempts to strengthen economic ties within the region. Constructive consultations on trade and investment issues have already occurred. We believe that mutually beneficial cooperation can be strengthened to our common benefit. Similar consultations with the developing countries of southern Africa are desirable. We have a strong interest in the economic health and stability of those nations. Commercial relationships, along with foreign assistance, will help us to attain that objective.",UNGD
USA,1981,"190.	The United States has also worked with the capital surplus members of OPEC on both a bilateral and a multilateral basis. We have been able to combine resources to attack development problems of common interest, such as food production. This cooperation should be continued and expanded.",UNGD
USA,1981,"191.	Finally, we plan to make bilateral consultative groups between our Government and those of developing countries more effective and to give full support to similar private sector arrangements. The United States Chamber of Commerce and its counterparts in many developing countries have developed particularly good relationships. We fully support these efforts and those of the private voluntary agencies. We are searching for means to work more closely with them.",UNGD
USA,1981,192.	In all of these cases the United States recognizes the need to be sensitive to the diverse character of the societies involved and to the international circumstances in which development must occur.,UNGD
USA,1981,"193.	Fourthly, growth for development is best achieved through reliance on incentives for individual economic performance. The individual is the beginning, the key element and the ultimate beneficiary of the development process. The greatest potential for development lies in the hard work and ingenuity of the farmer, the worker and the entrepreneur. They need incentives to produce and the opportunity to benefit from their labors.",UNGD
USA,1981,"194.	Suppression of economic incentives ultimately suppresses enthusiasm and invention, and the denial of personal freedom can be as great an obstacle to productivity as the denial of reward for achievement.",UNGD
USA,1981,"195.	History cautions against regimes that regiment their people in the name of ideals, yet fail to achieve either economic or social progress. Those Governments that have been more solicitous of the liberties of their people have also been more successful in securing both freedom and prosperity.",UNGD
USA,1981,"196.	The United States can offer what it knows best from its own experience. We have seen that policies which encourage private initiatives will promote better resource allocation and more rapid economic growth. Within a framework basically hospitable to market incentives, foreign private investment can supplement indigenous investment and contribute significantly to development.",UNGD
USA,1981,"197.	But our goal is not to impose either our economic values or our judgments on anyone. In the final analysis, each country's path to development will be shaped by its own history, philosophy and interests.",UNGD
USA,1981,"198.	Fifthly, development requires a certain measure of security and political stability. Political insecurity is a major barrier to development. Fear and uncertainty stifle the productivity of the individual. Scarce resources are squandered in conflict.",UNGD
USA,1981,"199.	The close relationship between security and development cannot be ignored. We are therefore committed to maintain and, where possible, to increase programs essential to deter international aggression and to provide the domestic security necessary to carry out sound economic programs. We have no intention of providing foreign assistance, moral comfort or the prestige of international platforms to countries that foster international violence.",UNGD
USA,1981,200.	The United Nations has a key role to play in resolving conflict and promoting international stability. We welcome the SecretaryGeneral's efforts to promote inter communal talks and a just settlement on Cyprus. We support a continuing role by the SecretaryGeneral's representative in the IranIraq conflict And South Korea's attempts to initiate a dialog with the North epitomize the search for a peaceful settlement that is at the heart of the Charter.,UNGD
USA,1981,"201.	One of the greatest dangers to the Charter today and to development itself is the willful violation of the national integrity of both Afghanistan and Cambodia by the Soviet Union and Viet Nam. Their behavior challenges the basic rights of all sovereign States. The world's hopes for peace, for security and for development will be jeopardized if ""might makes right"" becomes the law of nations.",UNGD
USA,1981,202.	The United States will continue to support security and stability as essential to progress. This is the basis of our active and continuing efforts to strengthen and expand the ceasefire in southern Lebanon. We shall also assist the negotiations specified by Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) in order to bring a just and lasting peace to the Middle East. Our policy is to remain a credible and reliable party in the negotiations to bring independence to Namibia on the basis of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and in a fashion acceptable to both the nations concerned and the international community.,UNGD
USA,1981,203.	The United States also believes that efforts to control arms either among regional States or between superPowers can make an important contribution to the security that facilitates development. But these efforts do not occur in a vacuum. The international community has tended over the years to overestimate the beneficial effects of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks [SALT] in dampening regional conflict. We have also tended to underestimate the impact of such conflict on the negotiations themselves.,UNGD
USA,1981,204.	The United States is strongly committed to balanced and verifiable arms control. We are equally committed to the peaceful resolution of regional disputes. Clearly the restraint implied by arms control must become a more widespread phenomenon if such agreements are to survive and to make their proper contribution to a more secure environment for development.,UNGD
USA,1981,205.	The United States is confident that a strategy for growth guided by these principles can succeed. We believe that three areas of action deserve immediate international attention.,UNGD
USA,1981,206.	The first is a global expansion of trade. Plans could be formulated for the 1982 GATT ministerial meeting with special concerns of growth in mind. A major priority should be to integrate more fully the developing countries into the international trading system on the basis,UNGD
USA,1981,of shared responsibilities and shared benefits.,UNGD
USA,1981,207.	The second area is an increase in investment. Our common objective should be to stimulate domestic and international private investment. We must encourage and support the individual investor.,UNGD
USA,1981,208.	The third is stronger international cooperation in food and in energy. The recent United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy recommended that the developing countries be assisted in assessing their energy resources and determining the best way to exploit them.3 The United Nations Development program and the World Bank have important follow-up responsibilities. We must all work to engage more effectively private participation in exploration and production in oil importing developing nations.,UNGD
USA,1981,209.	Domestic and international action must also go hand in hand to achieve food security. The United States continues to be the largest donor of food aid and places a paramount emphasis on its bilateral program to help developing countries increase food production. Greater attention should also be given to scientific and technological research that will yield more bountiful food supplies.,UNGD
USA,1981,"210.	I have outlined today the broad principles that guide America's approach to a new strategy for growth. In the immediate future, and prior to the Cancun meeting, we will announce specific proposals to deal with this and other issues of development.",UNGD
USA,1981,"211.	These broad principles reflect our view that the United States can and indeed will continue to make an essential contribution to the process of development. We do not claim to have all the answers, but we believe that our collective responsibilities for the future allow no more time to be lost in sterile debate and unrealistic demands. The time has come for a reasoned dialog with promise for the future,",UNGD
USA,1981,"212.	The search for economic progress, social justice and human dignity has been supported by the American people, themselves an example of successful development. Our initiatives and resources, through bilateral programs, the United Nations and other multilateral agencies, have made major contributions to the process of modernization throughout the world. For the United States, support of development constitutes a practical imperative.",UNGD
USA,1981,"213.	At the Ottawa meeting the United States reaffirmed its willingness to join its partners in exploring all avenues of consultation and cooperation with developing countries. In October President Reagan will go to the meeting in Cancun. He looks forward to a genuine and open exchange of views on questions of economic development and international cooperation. That meeting offers a novel opportunity to gain fresh understandings of the problems we face together. The United States will join in a constructive and cooperative spirit. Our objective is to bring about a new era of growth. But the purpose of both growth and development goes beyond simple materialism. As Winston Churchill said: ""Human beings and human societies are not structures that are built, or machines that are forged. They are plants that grow and must be treated as such"".",UNGD
USA,1981,"214.	Despite the difficulties of the moment, we should go forward in a spirit of optimism. We have the vision bequeathed to us by this Charter. We have the potential of all the peoples represented in this Hall. Let us go forward together to achieve a new era of growth for all mankind.",UNGD
USA,1982,I begin by paying a tribute to the new ,UNGD
USA,1982,"Secretary-General, who has brought great ",UNGD
USA,1982,distinction to the office during his brief ,UNGD
USA,1982,tenure. Dag Hammarskjold once told the General ,UNGD
USA,1982,Assembly that whichever word one chooses ,UNGD
USA,1982,"independence, impartiality, objectivity—they all ",UNGD
USA,1982,"describe essential aspects of what, without ",UNGD
USA,1982,"exception, must be in the attitude of the ",UNGD
USA,1982,"Secretary-General . Javier Perez de CueBar, a man ",UNGD
USA,1982,"of the third world, and, I am proud to note, of ",UNGD
USA,1982,"the New World as well, has already demonstrated ",UNGD
USA,1982,his strict adherence to this most exacting ,UNGD
USA,1982,"standard. In so doing, he has earned the esteem ",UNGD
USA,1982,of my Government and the gratitude of all who ,UNGD
USA,1982,believe in the purposes of the Charter.,UNGD
USA,1982,197.	I also congratulate Mr. Hollai of Hungary ,UNGD
USA,1982,upon his election as President of the ,UNGD
USA,1982,thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly.,UNGD
USA,1982,198.	As I stand here today I cannot help but ,UNGD
USA,1982,reflect on my relation to this city and to this ,UNGD
USA,1982,Hall. I was born about four miles from here. I ,UNGD
USA,1982,"was reared and educated not far away, just across ",UNGD
USA,1982,"the Hudson River, and I took a tour through this ",UNGD
USA,1982,"building just after it opened in 1952, marveling ",UNGD
USA,1982,"at the reality of a temple erected in the hope, ",UNGD
USA,1982,"at least, of abolishing war. ,",UNGD
USA,1982,199.	When I took that tour back in the early ,UNGD
USA,1982,"1950s, there was great public interest in what ",UNGD
USA,1982,was called the Meditation Room. I understand the ,UNGD
USA,1982,room is still here. But in the years since then ,UNGD
USA,1982,this institution has become more famous for talk ,UNGD
USA,1982,than for meditation. This Hall has heard great ,UNGD
USA,1982,ideas eloquently expressed. It has also heard ,UNGD
USA,1982,"double-talk, platitudes and ringing protestations ",UNGD
USA,1982,of innocence—all too often aimed at camouflaging ,UNGD
USA,1982,outrageous and inhuman acts.,UNGD
USA,1982,200.	But we must not ridicule words. I believe ,UNGD
USA,1982,that the greatest advance in human history was ,UNGD
USA,1982,"not the wheel, the use of electricity, or the ",UNGD
USA,1982,internal combustion engine. Indispensable to ,UNGD
USA,1982,"progress as these have been, our most remarkable ",UNGD
USA,1982,"achievement was the slow, clumsy but triumphant ",UNGD
USA,1982,creation of language. It was words that released ,UNGD
USA,1982,our ancestors from the prison of the solitary. ,UNGD
USA,1982,Words gave us the means to transmit to our ,UNGD
USA,1982,children and the future the crowning jewel of ,UNGD
USA,1982,human existence: knowledge. The Code of ,UNGD
USA,1982,"Ham¬murabi, the Bible, the Analects of Confucius, ",UNGD
USA,1982,"the teachings of the Buddha, the Koran, the ",UNGD
USA,1982,"insights of Shakespeare, the creed of Mahatma ",UNGD
USA,1982,Gandhi or Martin Luther King—all these were ,UNGD
USA,1982,arrangements of words.,UNGD
USA,1982,201.	Is it not profoundly revealing that the ,UNGD
USA,1982,first victims of tyrants are words? No people ,UNGD
USA,1982,better know the meaning of freedom than those who ,UNGD
USA,1982,have been arrested or beaten or imprisoned or ,UNGD
USA,1982,exiled because of what they said. A single man ,UNGD
USA,1982,"speaking out—a Lech Walesa, for example—is more ",UNGD
USA,1982,dangerous than an armored division.,UNGD
USA,1982,"202.	All of us here, whether we arrived after ",UNGD
USA,1982,"a short one-hour flight, as I did, or came from ",UNGD
USA,1982,"the other side of the globe, as many others of ",UNGD
USA,1982,"those present did, enter this auditorium for one ",UNGD
USA,1982,main purpose—to talk about what our Governments ,UNGD
USA,1982,see as the problems ahead and how they should be ,UNGD
USA,1982,solved. On one point at least we can all ,UNGD
USA,1982,agree—the problems are many and difficult. I ,UNGD
USA,1982,"shall not try, in the minutes allotted me, to ",UNGD
USA,1982,"deal with each, or even most, of these issues in ",UNGD
USA,1982,"detail. Instead, I want to give the Assembly some ",UNGD
USA,1982,sense of the principles and general approach that ,UNGD
USA,1982,the United States will take toward our common ,UNGD
USA,1982,problems.,UNGD
USA,1982,"203.	Americans are, by history and by ",UNGD
USA,1982,"inclination, a practical and pragmatic people, ",UNGD
USA,1982,yet a people with a vision. It is the ,UNGD
USA,1982,vision—usually simple and sometimes naive—that ,UNGD
USA,1982,has so often led us to dare and to achieve. ,UNGD
USA,1982,President Reagan's approach to foreign policy is ,UNGD
USA,1982,grounded squarely on standards drawn from the ,UNGD
USA,1982,pragmatic American experience. As de Tocqueville ,UNGD
USA,1982,"pointed out,  To achieve its objective, America ",UNGD
USA,1982,"relies on personal interest, and gives full reign ",UNGD
USA,1982,to the strength and reason of the individual. ,UNGD
USA,1982,That is as true now as when it was said 150 years ,UNGD
USA,1982,"ago. Our principal instru¬ment, now as then, is ",UNGD
USA,1982,"freedom. Our adversaries are the oppressors, the ",UNGD
USA,1982,"totalitarian, the tacticians of fear and pressure.",UNGD
USA,1982,"204.	On this foundation, President Reagan's ",UNGD
USA,1982,ideas and the structure of his foreign policy are ,UNGD
USA,1982,so straight-forward that those of us enmeshed in ,UNGD
USA,1982,day-to-day details may easily lose sight of them. ,UNGD
USA,1982,"The President never does, he consistently brings ",UNGD
USA,1982,us back to funda¬mentals. Today I will talk about ,UNGD
USA,1982,those fundamentals. They consist of four ideas ,UNGD
USA,1982,that guide our actions: we will start from ,UNGD
USA,1982,"realism; we will act from strength, both in power ",UNGD
USA,1982,and in purpose; we will stress the indispensable ,UNGD
USA,1982,"need to generate consent, build agree¬ments and ",UNGD
USA,1982,"negotiate on key issues, and we will conduct ",UNGD
USA,1982,ourselves in the belief that progress is ,UNGD
USA,1982,"possible, even though the road to achievement is ",UNGD
USA,1982,long and hard.,UNGD
USA,1982,"205.	If we are to change the world, we must ",UNGD
USA,1982,"first understand it. We must face reality, with ",UNGD
USA,1982,all its anguish and all its opportunities. Our ,UNGD
USA,1982,"era needs those who, as",UNGD
USA,1982,"Pericles said, have the clearest vision of what ",UNGD
USA,1982,"is before them, glory and danger alike, and ",UNGD
USA,1982,"notwithstanding that, go out to meet it.",UNGD
USA,1982,206.	Reality is not an illusion or a sleight ,UNGD
USA,1982,"of hand, though many would have us believe ",UNGD
USA,1982,"otherwise. The enormous, grinding machinery of ",UNGD
USA,1982,"Soviet propaganda daily seeks to distort reality, ",UNGD
USA,1982,to bend truth for its own purposes. Our world is ,UNGD
USA,1982,occupied by far too many Governments which seek ,UNGD
USA,1982,to conceal truth from their own people. They wish ,UNGD
USA,1982,to imprison reality by con¬trolling what can be ,UNGD
USA,1982,read or spoken or heard. They would have us ,UNGD
USA,1982,believe that black is white and up is down.,UNGD
USA,1982,207.	Much of present-day reality is ,UNGD
USA,1982,unpleasant. To describe conditions as we see them ,UNGD
USA,1982,as I do today and as President Reagan has over ,UNGD
USA,1982,"the course of his presidency, is not to seek ",UNGD
USA,1982,confrontation—far from it. Our purpose is to ,UNGD
USA,1982,avoid misunderstanding and to create the ,UNGD
USA,1982,necessary pre-conditions for change.,UNGD
USA,1982,"208.	So, when we see aggression, we will call ",UNGD
USA,1982,"it aggression. When we see subversion, we will ",UNGD
USA,1982,"call it subversion. When we see repression, we ",UNGD
USA,1982,will call it repression.,UNGD
USA,1982,"209.	The events in Poland, for example, cannot ",UNGD
USA,1982,be ignored or explained away. The Polish people ,UNGD
USA,1982,want to be their own master. Years of systematic ,UNGD
USA,1982,tyranny could not repress this desire; and nor ,UNGD
USA,1982,will martial law. But in Poland today truth must ,UNGD
USA,1982,hide in comers.,UNGD
USA,1982,210.	Nor can we simply turn our heads and look ,UNGD
USA,1982,the other way as Soviet divisions brutalize an ,UNGD
USA,1982,entire population in Afghanistan. The resistance ,UNGD
USA,1982,of the Afghan people is a valiant saga of our ,UNGD
USA,1982,times. We demean that valour if we do not ,UNGD
USA,1982,recognize its source.,UNGD
USA,1982,211.	And Soviet surrogates intervene in many ,UNGD
USA,1982,"coun¬tries, creating a new era of colonialism at ",UNGD
USA,1982,the moment in history when peoples around the ,UNGD
USA,1982,globe had lifted that burden from their backs.,UNGD
USA,1982,212.	Nor will we shy away from speaking of ,UNGD
USA,1982,other problems affecting the free and the ,UNGD
USA,1982,developing worlds. Much of the developing world ,UNGD
USA,1982,is threatened by a crisis of confidence in ,UNGD
USA,1982,financial institutions and the stultifying ,UNGD
USA,1982,effects of State-controlled economies. The ,UNGD
USA,1982,naturally vibrant economies of many Western ,UNGD
USA,1982,nations and trade between the world's major ,UNGD
USA,1982,trading partners are threatened by recession and ,UNGD
USA,1982,rising protectionism. The great alliances that ,UNGD
USA,1982,shore up world stability and growth—our ,UNGD
USA,1982,"hemispheric partnership, NATO—and the Western and ",UNGD
USA,1982,Japanese industrial democracies are challenged by ,UNGD
USA,1982,new as well as chronic strains.,UNGD
USA,1982,"213.	Finally, the shadow of war still darkens ",UNGD
USA,1982,the future of us all. There is no ultimate safety ,UNGD
USA,1982,in a nuclear balance of terror constantly ,UNGD
USA,1982,contested. There is no peace of mind at a time ,UNGD
USA,1982,when increasing numbers of nations appear willing ,UNGD
USA,1982,to launch their armies into battle for causes ,UNGD
USA,1982,which seem local but have ramifica¬tions for ,UNGD
USA,1982,regional and even global harmony.,UNGD
USA,1982,"214.	The list of troubles is long, the danger ",UNGD
USA,1982,of despair great. But there is another side to ,UNGD
USA,1982,the present reality; it is a reality of hope. We ,UNGD
USA,1982,are living in a fantastic time of opportunity.,UNGD
USA,1982,215.	Historians in the future will surely ,UNGD
USA,1982,marvel at the achievements of human beings in the ,UNGD
USA,1982,last half of this century. We have expanded the ,UNGD
USA,1982,"frontiers of thought—in science, in biology, in ",UNGD
USA,1982,"engineering, in painting and music and ",UNGD
USA,1982,"mathematics, in technology and architecture—far ",UNGD
USA,1982,"beyond the point anyone could have dared predict, ",UNGD
USA,1982,much less hope for. We know much today about the ,UNGD
USA,1982,oceans and forests and the geological strata that ,UNGD
USA,1982,lock in the story of our past. We have more ,UNGD
USA,1982,"knowledge about a baby, or the brain, than was ",UNGD
USA,1982,accumulated in 10 millennia before our time. We ,UNGD
USA,1982,are learning to produce food for all of us; we ,UNGD
USA,1982,are no longer helpless before the threat of ,UNGD
USA,1982,disease; we explore our universe as a matter of ,UNGD
USA,1982,course. We are confronting the nature of Nature ,UNGD
USA,1982,"herself. The oppor¬tunities are grand. This, too, ",UNGD
USA,1982,is a clear reality.,UNGD
USA,1982,216.	Thus realism shows us a world deeply ,UNGD
USA,1982,"troubled, yet with reason for hope. There is one ",UNGD
USA,1982,necessary condition: the only way we can enhance ,UNGD
USA,1982,"and amplify the human potential is by preserving, ",UNGD
USA,1982,defending and extending those most precious of ,UNGD
USA,1982,conditions—freedom and peace.,UNGD
USA,1982,217.	America's yearning for peace does not ,UNGD
USA,1982,lead us to be hesitant in developing our strength ,UNGD
USA,1982,"or in using it when necessary. Indeed, clarity ",UNGD
USA,1982,about the magnitude of the problems we face leads ,UNGD
USA,1982,inevitably to a realistic appreciation of the ,UNGD
USA,1982,importance of American strength. The strength of ,UNGD
USA,1982,"the free world imposes restraint, invites ",UNGD
USA,1982,accommodation and reassures those who would share ,UNGD
USA,1982,in the creative work that is the wonderful ,UNGD
USA,1982,consequence of liberty.,UNGD
USA,1982,218.	Strength means military forces to ensure ,UNGD
USA,1982,"that no other nation can threaten us, our ",UNGD
USA,1982,interests or our friends. But when I speak of ,UNGD
USA,1982,strength I do not mean military power alone. To ,UNGD
USA,1982,"Americans, strength derives as well from a solid ",UNGD
USA,1982,economic base and social vitality at home and ,UNGD
USA,1982,"with our partners. And, most funda¬mentally, the ",UNGD
USA,1982,true wellspring of strength lies in America's ,UNGD
USA,1982,moral commitment.,UNGD
USA,1982,219.	The bulwark of America's strength is ,UNGD
USA,1982,military power for peace. The American people ,UNGD
USA,1982,"have never accepted weakness, or hesitancy or ",UNGD
USA,1982,abdication. We will not put our destiny into the ,UNGD
USA,1982,hands of the ruthless. Americans today are ,UNGD
USA,1982,emphatically united on the neces¬sity of a strong ,UNGD
USA,1982,defense. This year's defense budget will ensure ,UNGD
USA,1982,that the United States will help its friends and ,UNGD
USA,1982,allies defend themselves—to make sure that peace ,UNGD
USA,1982,is seen clearly by all to be the only feasible ,UNGD
USA,1982,course in world affairs.,UNGD
USA,1982,220.	Along with military readiness and ,UNGD
USA,1982,capability must come the willingness to employ it ,UNGD
USA,1982,"in the cause of peace, justice and security. ",UNGD
USA,1982,Today in Beirut the United States ,UNGD
USA,1982,"Marines—together with our allies, Italy and ",UNGD
USA,1982,France—are helping the Lebanese Government und ,UNGD
USA,1982,armed forces ensure the safety of the peoples of ,UNGD
USA,1982,that tormented capital. I regret to report that I ,UNGD
USA,1982,have just learned that one American Marine died ,UNGD
USA,1982,and several were injured today in a mine ,UNGD
USA,1982,explosion at the Beirut airport. Our marines ,UNGD
USA,1982,represent an extension of American power not for ,UNGD
USA,1982,war but to secure the peace. They are there to ,UNGD
USA,1982,speed the moment when all foreign forces depart ,UNGD
USA,1982,from Lebanon. There must be an early agreement on ,UNGD
USA,1982,a timetable for the full application of Lebanon's ,UNGD
USA,1982,"independence, sovereignty and territorial ",UNGD
USA,1982,integrity. Lebanon deserves the world's help—to ,UNGD
USA,1982,secure peace and to rebuild a thriving society.,UNGD
USA,1982,221.	America will continue to use its strength ,UNGD
USA,1982,"with prudence, firmness and balance. We intend to ",UNGD
USA,1982,command the respect of adversaries and to deserve ,UNGD
USA,1982,the confidence of allies and partners.,UNGD
USA,1982,222.	The engine of America's strength is a sound economy.,UNGD
USA,1982,"223.	In a time of recession, industrialized ",UNGD
USA,1982,and less developed nations alike are bedeviled by ,UNGD
USA,1982,"excessive inflation, restricted markets, unused ",UNGD
USA,1982,"capacity, stagnating trade, growing pressure for ",UNGD
USA,1982,protectionism and the most potent enemy of ,UNGD
USA,1982,expansion—pervasive uncertainty.,UNGD
USA,1982,224.	The United States with its vast human and ,UNGD
USA,1982,scientific resources can survive an era of ,UNGD
USA,1982,economic strife and decay. But our moral ,UNGD
USA,1982,commitment and our self-interest require us to ,UNGD
USA,1982,use our technological and productive abilities to ,UNGD
USA,1982,build lasting prosperity at home and to ,UNGD
USA,1982,contribute to a sound economic situation abroad.,UNGD
USA,1982,225.	President Reagan has instituted a bold ,UNGD
USA,1982,pro¬gram to get the American economy moving. Our ,UNGD
USA,1982,"rate of inflation is down markedly, and we will ",UNGD
USA,1982,keep it down. That will add stability to the ,UNGD
USA,1982,value of the dollar and give greater confidence ,UNGD
USA,1982,to international financial markets.,UNGD
USA,1982,226.	The recent drop in United States interest ,UNGD
USA,1982,rates will stimulate new investments within and ,UNGD
USA,1982,beyond our shores. Conservation through market pricing ,UNGD
USA,1982,of energy has reduced United States demand for ,UNGD
USA,1982,world energy supplies. We are putting the ,UNGD
USA,1982,recession behind us. A growing and open American ,UNGD
USA,1982,economy will provide new markets for goods and ,UNGD
USA,1982,"services produced elsewhere, and new ",UNGD
USA,1982,opportunities for foreign invest¬ments. Just as ,UNGD
USA,1982,"we have a stake in world-wide recovery, others ",UNGD
USA,1982,will prosper as our recovery develops.,UNGD
USA,1982,"227.	For wider prosperity to take hold, we ",UNGD
USA,1982,must co¬operatively attend to these international ,UNGD
USA,1982,issues. The lure of protectionist trade policies ,UNGD
USA,1982,must be resisted everywhere—here in the United ,UNGD
USA,1982,States and all over the world—whether in the form ,UNGD
USA,1982,of overt import restrictions and export subsidies ,UNGD
USA,1982,or by more subtle domestic pro¬grammes. These can ,UNGD
USA,1982,only distort world trade and impair growth ,UNGD
USA,1982,everywhere. Let us determine to make the November ,UNGD
USA,1982,ministerial meeting of GATT a time to stem these ,UNGD
USA,1982,protectionist pressures and to reinvigorate ,UNGD
USA,1982,positive efforts for a more open trading system.,UNGD
USA,1982,228.	The implications of the external debt of ,UNGD
USA,1982,many nations must be understood. Immediate debt ,UNGD
USA,1982,problems are manageable if we use good sense and ,UNGD
USA,1982,avoid destabilizing actions. But the magnitude of ,UNGD
USA,1982,external debt will almost inevitably reduce ,UNGD
USA,1982,resources available for future lending for ,UNGD
USA,1982,development purposes. Economic adjustment is ,UNGD
USA,1982,imperative. IMF can provide critical help and ,UNGD
USA,1982,guidance in any country's efforts to smooth the ,UNGD
USA,1982,adjustment process. The new borrowing ,UNGD
USA,1982,arrange¬ment proposed by the United States can be ,UNGD
USA,1982,crucial to this effort.	',UNGD
USA,1982,229.	And the necessity of reducing government ,UNGD
USA,1982,interference in the market must be recognized. Of ,UNGD
USA,1982,course every nation has the right to organize ,UNGD
USA,1982,"society as its inhabitants wish, but economic ",UNGD
USA,1982,facts cannot be ignored. Those facts clearly ,UNGD
USA,1982,demonstrate that the world's command economies ,UNGD
USA,1982,have failed abysmally to meet the needs of their ,UNGD
USA,1982,peoples. The newly pros¬perous industrialized ,UNGD
USA,1982,nations are those with the most free and open ,UNGD
USA,1982,markets.,UNGD
USA,1982,230.	The bedrock of our strength is our moral ,UNGD
USA,1982,and spiritual character. The sources of true ,UNGD
USA,1982,strength lie deeper than economic or military ,UNGD
USA,1982,power. They lie in the dedication of a free ,UNGD
USA,1982,people which knows its responsibility. America's ,UNGD
USA,1982,institutions are those of freedom accessible to ,UNGD
USA,1982,every person and of govern¬ment as the ,UNGD
USA,1982,accountable servant of the people. Equal ,UNGD
USA,1982,"opportunity, due process of law, open trial by ",UNGD
USA,1982,"jury, freedom of belief, speech and assembly, our ",UNGD
USA,1982,"Bill of Rights, our guarantees of liberty and ",UNGD
USA,1982,limited govern¬ment were hammered out in ,UNGD
USA,1982,centuries of ordeal. Because we care about these ,UNGD
USA,1982,human values for ourselves so must we then be ,UNGD
USA,1982,"concerned, and legiti¬mately so, with abuses of ",UNGD
USA,1982,"freedom, justice and humanitarian principles ",UNGD
USA,1982,beyond our borders. This is why we will speak and ,UNGD
USA,1982,"act for prisoners of con¬science, against ",UNGD
USA,1982,terrorism and against the brutal silencing of the ,UNGD
USA,1982,Soviet Helsinki Watch Committee. This is why we ,UNGD
USA,1982,are anxious to participate in periodic reviews of ,UNGD
USA,1982,the human rights performance of ourselves as well ,UNGD
USA,1982,as of others. We welcome scrutiny of our own ,UNGD
USA,1982,"system. We are not perfect and we know it, but we ",UNGD
USA,1982,have nothing to hide.,UNGD
USA,1982,231.	Our belief in liberty guides our policies ,UNGD
USA,1982,here in' the United Nations as elsewhere. ,UNGD
USA,1982,Therefore in this forum the United States will ,UNGD
USA,1982,"continue to insist upon fairness, balance and ",UNGD
USA,1982,truth. We take the debate on human rights ,UNGD
USA,1982,seriously. We insist upon honesty in the use of ,UNGD
USA,1982,"language; we will point out inconsistencies, ",UNGD
USA,1982,double standards and lies. We will not compromise ,UNGD
USA,1982,our commitment to truth.,UNGD
USA,1982,232.	The world has work to do for the ,UNGD
USA,1982,"realists, the pragmatists and the free. With a ",UNGD
USA,1982,clear understanding of the troubled circumstances ,UNGD
USA,1982,of the hour and with a strengthened ability to ,UNGD
USA,1982,"act, we need as well the vision to see beyond the ",UNGD
USA,1982,immediate present.,UNGD
USA,1982,233.	All of us here represent nations which ,UNGD
USA,1982,must understand and accept the imperative of fair ,UNGD
USA,1982,"engage¬ment on the issues before us and, beyond ",UNGD
USA,1982,"that, of common effort towards shared goals. ",UNGD
USA,1982,Whether we are seeking to bring peace to regional ,UNGD
USA,1982,conflict or a reso¬lution of commercial ,UNGD
USA,1982,"differences, the time of imposed solutions has ",UNGD
USA,1982,"passed. Conquest, pressure, acqui¬escence under ",UNGD
USA,1982,duress was common in decades not long past—but ,UNGD
USA,1982,not today. Not everybody who wants his concern ,UNGD
USA,1982,addressed will find us automatically receptive. ,UNGD
USA,1982,But when negotiations are in order America is ,UNGD
USA,1982,prepared to go to work on the global agenda and ,UNGD
USA,1982,to do so in a way that all may emerge better off ,UNGD
USA,1982,and more secure than before.,UNGD
USA,1982,234.	We manage our problems more intelligently ,UNGD
USA,1982,and with greater mutual understanding when we can ,UNGD
USA,1982,bring ourselves to recognize these problems as ,UNGD
USA,1982,expressions of mankind's basic dilemma. We are ,UNGD
USA,1982,seldom confronted with simple issues of right and ,UNGD
USA,1982,"wrong, between good and evil. Only those who do ",UNGD
USA,1982,not bear the direct burden of responsibility for ,UNGD
USA,1982,decision and action can indulge themselves in the ,UNGD
USA,1982,denial of that reality. The task of statesmanship ,UNGD
USA,1982,"is to mediate between two—or several— causes, ",UNGD
USA,1982,each of which often has a legitimate claim.,UNGD
USA,1982,235.	It is on this foundation that the United ,UNGD
USA,1982,States stands ready to try to solve the problems ,UNGD
USA,1982,"of our time —to overcome chaos, deprivation and ",UNGD
USA,1982,the heightened dangers of an era in which ideas ,UNGD
USA,1982,and cultures too often tend to clash and ,UNGD
USA,1982,technologies threaten to out¬pace our ,UNGD
USA,1982,institutions of control.,UNGD
USA,1982,236.	We are engaged in negotiations and ,UNGD
USA,1982,efforts to find answers to issues affecting every ,UNGD
USA,1982,part of the globe and every aspect of our lives ,UNGD
USA,1982,upon it. Let me take up just two of these with ,UNGD
USA,1982,you.,UNGD
USA,1982,237.	The agony of the Middle East now exceeds ,UNGD
USA,1982,the ability of news bulletins or speeches to ,UNGD
USA,1982,express: it is a searing wound on our ,UNGD
USA,1982,consciousness. The region is in constant ferment. ,UNGD
USA,1982,"Unrest flares into violence, terror, insurrection ",UNGD
USA,1982,and civil strife. War follows war. It is clear to ,UNGD
USA,1982,"everyone in this Hall that international peace, ",UNGD
USA,1982,security and co-operative progress cannot be ,UNGD
USA,1982,truly achieved until this terrible regional ,UNGD
USA,1982,conflict is settled.,UNGD
USA,1982,238.	AM of us have witnessed in the past ,UNGD
USA,1982,several months a graphic reminder of the need for ,UNGD
USA,1982,practical peace negotiations in the Middle East. ,UNGD
USA,1982,Of the nations in the world which need and ,UNGD
USA,1982,"deserve peace, Israel surely holds a pre-eminent ",UNGD
USA,1982,place. Of the peoples of the world who need and ,UNGD
USA,1982,deserve a place with which they can truly ,UNGD
USA,1982,"identify, the Palestinian claim is undeniable.",UNGD
USA,1982,239.	But Israel can have permanent peace only ,UNGD
USA,1982,in a context in which the Palestinian people also ,UNGD
USA,1982,"realize their legitimate rights. Similarly, the ",UNGD
USA,1982,Palestinian people will be able to achieve their ,UNGD
USA,1982,legitimate rights only in a context which gives ,UNGD
USA,1982,to Israel what it so clearly has a right to ,UNGD
USA,1982,"demand: to exist, and to exist in peace and ",UNGD
USA,1982,security.,UNGD
USA,1982,240.	This most complex of international ,UNGD
USA,1982,conflicts cannot be resolved by force: neither ,UNGD
USA,1982,the might of armies nor the violence of ,UNGD
USA,1982,terrorists can succeed in imposing the will of ,UNGD
USA,1982,the strong upon the weak. Nor can it be settled ,UNGD
USA,1982,simply by the rhetoric of even the most carefully ,UNGD
USA,1982,worded document. It can be resolved only through ,UNGD
USA,1982,"the give and take of direct negotiations, leading ",UNGD
USA,1982,to the establishment of practical arrangements on ,UNGD
USA,1982,"the ground. In other words, it can be resolved ",UNGD
USA,1982,only through hard work. For those who believe ,UNGD
USA,1982,that there is no contradiction between permanent ,UNGD
USA,1982,peace for Israel and the legitimate rights of the ,UNGD
USA,1982,Palestinian people—and fbr those who believe that ,UNGD
USA,1982,both are essential for peace and that neither can ,UNGD
USA,1982,be achieved without the other—the task can truly ,UNGD
USA,1982,be a labour of love.,UNGD
USA,1982,241.	On 1 September President Reagan ,UNGD
USA,1982,challenged the parties to the Arab-Israeli ,UNGD
USA,1982,conflict to make a fresh start on the road to ,UNGD
USA,1982,peace in the Middle East. The Camp David ,UNGD
USA,1982,"agreements, resting squarely on Security Council ",UNGD
USA,1982,"resolution 242 (1967), with its formula of peace ",UNGD
USA,1982,"for territory, remain available to those who ",UNGD
USA,1982,would accept the challenge to make this journey ,UNGD
USA,1982,"with us. The road will not be easy, but in his ",UNGD
USA,1982,statement President Reagan made a number of ,UNGD
USA,1982,"proposals which, for those who are willing to ",UNGD
USA,1982,"join the effort, make the journey safer and ",UNGD
USA,1982,easier.,UNGD
USA,1982,242.	I call on all concerned to accept ,UNGD
USA,1982,President Reagan's challenge and hasten the ,UNGD
USA,1982,"realization of true peace in the Middle East,",UNGD
USA,1982,243.	In addition to the imperative need to ,UNGD
USA,1982,"resolve regional problems, there is an equally ",UNGD
USA,1982,"significant global imperative: to halt, and ",UNGD
USA,1982,"reverse, the global arms build¬up. As an ",UNGD
USA,1982,"American, I am aware that arms control and ",UNGD
USA,1982,disarmament are a special responsibility of the ,UNGD
USA,1982,"world's most powerful nations, the United States ",UNGD
USA,1982,"and the Soviet Union. And as an American, I can ",UNGD
USA,1982,report that we are fulfilling our responsibility ,UNGD
USA,1982,to seek to limit and reduce conventional and ,UNGD
USA,1982,nuclear arms to the lowest possible levels.,UNGD
USA,1982,"244.	With this goal in mind, President Reagan ",UNGD
USA,1982,has initiated a comprehensive program for ,UNGD
USA,1982,"negotiated arms reductions. In Central Europe, ",UNGD
USA,1982,"the most heavily armed region on this planet, the ",UNGD
USA,1982,Western allies are seeking substantial reductions ,UNGD
USA,1982,in troops of NATO and the Warsaw Pact to equal ,UNGD
USA,1982,"levels. To achieve this goal, we have recently ",UNGD
USA,1982,introduced a new proposal designed to revitalize ,UNGD
USA,1982,"the Vienna Talks on Mutual Reduction of Forces, ",UNGD
USA,1982,Armaments and Associated Measures in Central ,UNGD
USA,1982,Europe.,UNGD
USA,1982,"245.	In the area of strategic arms, the United ",UNGD
USA,1982,States has also taken the initiative by calling ,UNGD
USA,1982,for a one-third reduction in the number of ,UNGD
USA,1982,nuclear warheads that American and Soviet ,UNGD
USA,1982,ballistic missiles can deliver. And in the talks ,UNGD
USA,1982,"in Geneva on intermediate-range nuclear forces, ",UNGD
USA,1982,"the United States has gone even further, by ",UNGD
USA,1982,asking the Soviet Union to agree to a bold ,UNGD
USA,1982,proposal for eliminating an entire category of ,UNGD
USA,1982,weapons from the arsenals of the two sides.,UNGD
USA,1982,"246.	But important as these negotiations are, ",UNGD
USA,1982,the problems of arms controls cannot be left to ,UNGD
USA,1982,the two super-Powers. The threat of nuclear ,UNGD
USA,1982,proliferation extends to every region in the ,UNGD
USA,1982,world and demands the attention and energy of ,UNGD
USA,1982,"every Government. This is not solely, or even ",UNGD
USA,1982,"primarily, a concern of the super¬ powers. The ",UNGD
USA,1982,non-nuclear countries will not be safer if ,UNGD
USA,1982,nuclear intimidation is added to already deadly ,UNGD
USA,1982,regional conflicts. The developing nations will ,UNGD
USA,1982,not be more prosperous if scarce resources and ,UNGD
USA,1982,scientific talent are diverted to nuclear weapons ,UNGD
USA,1982,and delivery systems.,UNGD
USA,1982,"247.	Unfortunately, as the task becomes more ",UNGD
USA,1982,im¬portant it also becomes more difficult. ,UNGD
USA,1982,Greater quantities of dangerous materials are ,UNGD
USA,1982,produced and new suppliers emerge who lack a ,UNGD
USA,1982,clear commitment to non-proliferation. But the ,UNGD
USA,1982,technology that helped to create the problems can ,UNGD
USA,1982,supply answers as well. Vigorous action to ,UNGD
USA,1982,strengthen the barriers to aggres¬sion and to ,UNGD
USA,1982,resolve disputes peacefully can remove the ,UNGD
USA,1982,insecurities that are the root of the problem. ,UNGD
USA,1982,"The United States, for its part, will work to ",UNGD
USA,1982,tighten export controls; to promote broader ,UNGD
USA,1982,acceptance of safeguards; to urge meaningful ,UNGD
USA,1982,actions when agreements are violated; and to ,UNGD
USA,1982,strengthen IAEA. As our action last week in ,UNGD
USA,1982,"Vienna should make clear, we will not accept ",UNGD
USA,1982,attempts to politicize—and therefore emasculate— ,UNGD
USA,1982,such vital institutions.,UNGD
USA,1982,248.	Perhaps the most common phrase spoken by ,UNGD
USA,1982,the American people in our more than two ,UNGD
USA,1982,centuries of national life has been you can't ,UNGD
USA,1982,stop progress . Our people have always been ,UNGD
USA,1982,imbued with the conviction that the future of a ,UNGD
USA,1982,free people would be good. America continues to ,UNGD
USA,1982,"offer that vision to the world. With that vision, ",UNGD
USA,1982,"and with the freedom to act creatively, there is ",UNGD
USA,1982,nothing that people of good will need fear.,UNGD
USA,1982,"249.	I am not here to assert, however, that ",UNGD
USA,1982,"the way is easy, or quick, or that the future is ",UNGD
USA,1982,bound to be bright. There is a poem by Carl ,UNGD
USA,1982,Sandburg in which a traveler asks the Sphinx to ,UNGD
USA,1982,speak and reveal the distilled wisdom of all the ,UNGD
USA,1982,ages. The Sphinx does speak. Its words are: ,UNGD
USA,1982,Don't expect too much . That is good counsel for ,UNGD
USA,1982,ail of us here. It does not mean that great ,UNGD
USA,1982,accomplishments are beyond our reach. We can help ,UNGD
USA,1982,shape more constructive international rela¬tions ,UNGD
USA,1982,and give our children a better chance at life. It ,UNGD
USA,1982,"does mean, however, that risk, pain, expense, and ",UNGD
USA,1982,above all endurance are needed to bring these ,UNGD
USA,1982,achieve¬ments into our grasp.,UNGD
USA,1982,250.	We must recognize the complex and vexing ,UNGD
USA,1982,character of this world. We should not indulge ,UNGD
USA,1982,our¬selves in fantasies of perfection of ,UNGD
USA,1982,"unfulfillable plans, or solutions gained by ",UNGD
USA,1982,pressure. It is the responsibility of leaders not ,UNGD
USA,1982,to feed the growing appetite for easy promises ,UNGD
USA,1982,and grand assurances. The plain truth is this: we ,UNGD
USA,1982,face the prospect of all too few decisive or ,UNGD
USA,1982,dramatic breakthroughs; we face the necessity of ,UNGD
USA,1982,dedicatingour energies and creativity to a ,UNGD
USA,1982,protracted struggle towards eventual success.,UNGD
USA,1982,"251.	That is the approach of my country, ",UNGD
USA,1982,because we see not only the necessity but the ,UNGD
USA,1982,"possibility, of making important progress on a ",UNGD
USA,1982,broad front. For example: despite deep-seated ,UNGD
USA,1982,"differences between us and the Soviet Union, both ",UNGD
USA,1982,"sides are now at work in a serious, businesslike ",UNGD
USA,1982,effort at arms control; Presi¬dent Reagan has ,UNGD
USA,1982,issued an important call for an inter¬national ,UNGD
USA,1982,conference on military expenditure. The ,UNGD
USA,1982,achievement of a common system for accounting and ,UNGD
USA,1982,reporting is the prerequisite for subsequent ,UNGD
USA,1982,agreement to limits or curtail defense budgets. ,UNGD
USA,1982,The Caribbean Basin Initiative establishes the ,UNGD

USA,1983,"1.	Thank you for granting me the honor of speaking today, on this first day of the general debate at the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. Once again I come before this body preoccupied with peace. Last year I stood in this chamber to address the special session on disarmament. I have come today to renew my nation's commitment to peace. I have come to discuss how we can keep faith with the dreams that created this Organization.",UNGD
USA,1983,"2.	The United Nations was founded in the aftermath of the Second World War to protect future generations from the scourge of war, to promote political self- determination and global prosperity, and to strengthen the bonds of civility among nations. The founders sought to replace a world at war with a world of civilized order. They hoped that a world of relentless conflict would give way to a new era, one where freedom from violence prevailed.",UNGD
USA,1983,"3.	Whatever challenges the world was bound to face, the founders intended this body to stand for certain values, even if they could not be enforced, and to condemn violence, even if it could not be stopped. This body was to speak with the voice of moral authority. That was to be its greatest power.",UNGD
USA,1983,"4.	But the awful truth is that the use of violence for political gain has become more, not less, widespread in the last decade. Events of recent weeks have presented new, unwelcome evidence of brutal disregard for life and truth. They have offered unwanted testimony on how divided and dangerous our world is, how quick the recourse to violence.",UNGD
USA,1983,5.	What has happened to the dreams of the founders of the United Nations?,UNGD
USA,1983,6.	What has happened to the spirit which created the United Nations?,UNGD
USA,1983,"7.	The answer is clear: Governments got in the way of the dreams of the people. Dreams became issues of East versus West. Hopes became political rhetoric. Progress became a search for power and domination. Somewhere the truth was lost that people do not make war, governments do.",UNGD
USA,1983,"8.	And today, in Asia, Africa, Latin America, the Middle East and the North Pacific, the weapons of war shatter the security of the peoples who live there, endanger the peace of neighbors, and create ever more arenas of confrontation between the great Powers. During the past year alone, violent conflicts have occurred in the hills around Beirut, the deserts of Chad and the Western Sahara, in the mountains of El Salvador, the streets of Suriname, the cities and countryside of Afghanistan, the borders of Kampuchea, and the battlefields of Iran and Iraq.",UNGD
USA,1983,"9.	We cannot count on the instinct for survival to protect us against war. Despite all the wasted lives and hopes that war produces, it has remained a regular, if horribly costly, means by which nations have sought to settle their disputes or advance their goals.",UNGD
USA,1983,"10.	And the progress in weapons technology has far outstripped the progress toward peace. In modern times, a new, more terrifying element has entered into the calculations—nuclear weapons. A nuclear war cannot be won and it must never be fought. I believe that if governments are determined to deter and prevent war, there will not be war. Nothing is more in keeping with the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations than arms control.",UNGD
USA,1983,"11.	When I spoke before the twelfth special session, devoted to disarmament. I affirmed the United States Government's commitment, and my personal commitment, to reduce nuclear arms, and to negotiate in good faith toward that end.",UNGD
USA,1983,"12.	Today, I reaffirm those commitments. The United States has already reduced the number of its nuclear weapons worldwide and, while replacement of older weapons is unavoidable, we wish to negotiate arms reduction; and to achieve significant, equitable, verifiable arms control agreements. And let me add, we must ensure that world security is not undermined by the further spread of nuclear weapons. Nuclear non-proliferation must not be the forgotten element of the world's arms control agenda",UNGD
USA,1983,"13.	At my last visit here, I expressed hope that a whole class of weapons systems—the longer-range intermediate nuclear forces—could be banned from the face of the earth. I believe that to relieve the deep concern of peoples in both Europe and Asia, the time was right, for the first time in history, to resolve a security threat exclusively through arms control. I still believe the elimination of these weapons—the zero option—is the best, fairest, most practical solution to the problem. Unfortunately, the Soviet Union declined to accept the total elimination of this class of weapons.",UNGD
USA,1983,"14.	When I was here last, I hoped that the critical Strategic Arms Reduction Talks would focus, and urgently so, on those systems that carry the greatest risk of nuclear war—the fast-flying, accurate, intercontinental ballistic missiles which pose a first strike potential. I also hoped the negotiations could reduce by one half the number of strategic missiles on each side and reduce their warheads by one third. Again, I was disappointed when the Soviets declined to consider such deep cuts, and refused as well to concentrate on these most dangerous destabilizing weapons.",UNGD
USA,1983,"15.	Despite the rebuffs, the United States has not abandoned and will not abandon the search for meaningful arms control agreements. Last June, I proposed a new approach toward the START negotiations. We did not alter our objective of substantial reductions, but we recognized that there are a variety of ways to achieve this end. During the last round of Geneva talks, we presented a draft treaty which responded to a number of concerns raised by the Soviet Union. We will continue to build upon this initiative.",UNGD
USA,1983,"16.	Similarly, in our negotiations on intermediate-range nuclear forces, when the Soviet leaders adamantly refused to consider the total elimination of these weapons, the United States made a new offer. We proposed, as an interim solution, some equal number on both sides between one and 572. We recommended the lowest possible level. Once again, the Soviets refused an equitable solution and proposed instead what might be called a ""half zero option""—zero for us, and many hundreds of warheads for them. That is where things stand today, but I still have not given up hope that the Soviet Union will enter into serious negotiations.",UNGD
USA,1983,"17.	We are determined to spare no effort to achieve a sound, equitable and verifiable agreement. For this reason, I have given new instructions to Mr. Nitze at Geneva, telling him to put forward a package of steps designed to advance the negotiations as rapidly as possible. These initiatives build on the interim framework that the United States advanced last March and address concerns that the Soviets have raised at the bargaining table in the past.",UNGD
USA,1983,"18.	Specifically, first, the United States proposes a new initiative on global limits. If the Soviet Union agrees to reductions and limits on a global basis, the United States for its part will not offset the entire Soviet global missile deployment through United States deployments in Europe. We would, of course, retain the right to deploy missiles elsewhere.",UNGD
USA,1983,"19.	Second, the United States is prepared to be more flexible on the content of the current talks. The United States will consider mutually acceptable ways to address the Soviet desire that an agreement should limit aircraft as well as missiles,",UNGD
USA,1983,"20.	Third, the United States will address the mix of missiles that would result from reductions. In the context of reductions to equal levels, we are prepared to reduce the number of Pershing II ballistic missiles as well as ground-launched cruise missiles.",UNGD
USA,1983,"21.	I have decided to put forward these important initiatives after full and extensive consultations with our allies, including personal correspondence that I have had with the leaders of the Governments of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Japan and frequent meetings of the NATO Special Consultative Group. I have also stayed in close touch with other concerned friends and allies. The door to an agreement is open. It is time for the Soviet Union to walk through it.",UNGD
USA,1983,"22.	I want to make an unequivocal pledge to those gathered today in this world arena. The United States seeks and will accept any equitable, verifiable agreement that stabilizes forces at lower levels than currently exist. We are ready to be flexible in our approach—indeed, willing to compromise. We cannot, however, especially in light of recent events, compromise on the necessity of effective verification.",UNGD
USA,1983,"23.	Reactions to the Korean airliner tragedy are a timely reminder of just how different the Soviets' concept of truth and international co-operation is from that of the rest of the world. Evidence abounds that we cannot simply assume that agreements negotiated with the Soviet Union will be fulfilled. We negotiated the Helsinki Final Act,' but the promised freedoms have not been provided and those in the Soviet Union who sought to monitor their fulfillment languish in prison. We negotiated a biological weapons convention, but deadly yellow rain and other toxic agents fall on Hmong villages and Afghan encampments. We have negotiated arms agreements, but the high level of Soviet encoding hides the information needed for their verification. A newly discovered radar facility and a new inter-continental ballistic missile raise serious concerns about Soviet compliance with agreements already negotiated.",UNGD
USA,1983,"24.	Peace cannot be served by pseudo-control of arms. We need reliable, reciprocal reductions. I call upon the Soviet Union today to reduce the tensions it has heaped on the world in the past few weeks and to show a firm commitment to peace by coming to the bargaining table with a new understanding of its obligations. I urge it to match our flexibility. If the Soviets sit down at the bargaining table seeking genuine arms reductions, there will be arms reductions. The Governments of the West and their peoples will not be diverted by misinformation and threats. The time has come for the Soviet Union to show proof that it wants arms control in reality, not just in rhetoric.",UNGD
USA,1983,25.	Meaningful arms control agreements between the United States and the Soviet Union would make our world less dangerous; so would a number of confidence- building steps that we have already proposed to the Soviet Union.,UNGD
USA,1983,"26.	Arms control requires a spirit beyond narrow national interests. This spirit is a basic pillar on which the United Nations was founded. We seek a return to this spirit. A fundamental step would be a true non-alignment of the United Nations. This would signal a return to the true values of the Charter, including the principle of universality. The Members of the United Nations must be aligned on the side of justice, rather than injustice; peace, rather than aggression; human dignity, rather than subjugation. Any other alignment is beneath the purpose of this great body and destructive of the harmony that it seeks. What harms the Charter harms peace.",UNGD
USA,1983,"27.	The founders of the United Nations expected that Member nations would behave and vote as individuals, after they had weighed the merits of an issue—rather like a great, global town meeting. The emergence of blocs and the polarization of the United Nations undermine all that the Organization initially valued.",UNGD
USA,1983,"28.	We must remember that the Movement of Non- Aligned Countries was founded to counter the development of blocs and to promote cooperation between them. Its founders spoke of the right of smaller countries not to become involved in others' disagreements. Since then, membership in the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries has grown dramatically, but not all the new members have shared the founders' commitment of genuine non- alignment. Indeed, client Governments of the Soviet Union which have long since lost their independence have flocked into the Movement and once inside have worked against its true purpose. Pseudo non-alignment is no better than pseudo-control of arms.",UNGD
USA,1983,"29.	The United States rejects as false and misleading the view of the world as divided between the empires of the East and the West. We reject it on factual grounds. The United States does not head any bloc of subservient nations, nor do we desire to. What is called ""the West"" is a free alliance of Governments, most of which are democratic and all of which greatly value their independence. What is called ""the East"" is an empire directed from the center, which is Moscow. ",UNGD
USA,1983,"30.	The United States today, as in the past, is a champion of freedom and self-determination for all peoples. We welcome diversity; we support the right of all nations to define and pursue their national goals. We respect their decisions and their sovereignty, asking only that they respect the decisions and sovereignty of others. Just look at the world over the last 30 years and then decide for yourselves whether the United States or the Soviet Union has pursued an expansionist policy.",UNGD
USA,1983,"31.	Today, the United States contributes to peace by supporting collective efforts by the international community. We give our unwavering support to the peacekeeping efforts of this body, as well as to other multilateral peace-keeping efforts around the world. The United Nations has a proud history of promoting conciliation and helping keep the peace. Today, United Nations peace-keeping forces or observers are present in Cyprus, Kashmir, on the Golan Heights and in Lebanon.",UNGD
USA,1983,"32.	In addition to our encouragement of international diplomacy, the United States recognizes its responsibilities to use its own influence for peace. From the days when Theodore Roosevelt mediated the Russo-Japanese War in 1905 we have a long and honorable tradition of mediating or dampening conflicts and promoting peaceful solutions. In Lebanon, we, along with France, Italy and the United Kingdom, have worked for a cease-fire, for the withdrawal of all external forces, and for restoration of Lebanon's sovereignty and territorial integrity. In Chad, we have joined others in supporting the recognized Government, in the face of external aggression. In Central America, as in southern Africa, we are seeking to discourage reliance upon force and to construct a framework for peaceful negotiations. We support a policy to disengage the major Powers from third-world conflict.",UNGD
USA,1983,"33.	The Charter of the United Nations gives an important role to regional organizations in the search for peace. The United States efforts in the cause of peace are only one expression of a spirit that also animates others in the world community. The Organization of American States was a pioneer in regional security efforts. In Central America, the members of the Contadora Group are striving to lay a foundation for peaceful resolution of that region's problems. In East Asia, countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations have built a framework for peaceful political and economic co-operation that has greatly strengthened the prospects for lasting peace in their region. In Africa, organizations such as the Economic Community of West African States are being forged to provide practical structures in the struggle to realize Africa's potential.",UNGD
USA,1983,"34.	From the beginning, our hope for the United Nations has been that it would reflect the international community at its best. The United Nations at its best can help us transcend fear and violence and can act as an enormous force for peace and prosperity. Working together, we can combat international lawlessness and promote human dignity.",UNGD
USA,1983,"35.	If the Governments represented in this chamber want peace as genuinely as their peoples do, we shall find it. We can do so by reasserting the moral authority of the United Nations.",UNGD
USA,1983,"36.	In recent weeks, the moral outrage of the world seems to have reawakened. Out of the billions of people who inhabit this planet, why, some might ask, should the death of several hundred shake the world so profoundly? Why should the death of a mother flying toward a reunion with her family or the death of a scholar heading toward new pursuits of knowledge matter so deeply?",UNGD
USA,1983,Why are nations which lost no citizens in the tragedy so angry?,UNGD
USA,1983,37.	The reason rests on our assumptions about civilized life and the search for peace. The confidence that allows a mother or a scholar to travel to Asia or Africa or Europe or anywhere else on this planet may be only a small victory in humanity's struggle for peace. Yet what is peace if not the sum of such small victories?,UNGD
USA,1983,"38.	Each stride for peace and every small victory are important for the journey towards a larger and lasting peace. We have made progress. We have avoided another world war. We have seen an end to the traditional colonial era and the birth of 100 newly sovereign nations. Even though development remains a formidable challenge, we have witnessed remarkable economic growth among the industrialized and the developing nations. The United Nations and its affiliates have made important contributions to the quality of life on this planet, such as directly saving countless lives through its refugee and emergency relief programmes. These broad achievements, however, have been overshadowed by the problems that weigh so heavily upon us. The problems are old, but it is not too late to commit ourselves to a new beginning, a beginning fresh with the ideals of the Charter.",UNGD
USA,1983,"39.	Today, at the beginning of this thirty-eighth session, I solemnly pledge my nation to upholding the original ideals of the United Nations. Our goals are those that guide this very body. Our ends are the same as those of the founders of the United Nations, who sought to replace a world at war with one where the rule of law would prevail, where human rights were honored, where development would blossom, where conflict would give way to freedom from violence.",UNGD
USA,1983,40.	In 1956 President Dwight Eisenhower made an observation on weapons and deterrence in a letter to a publisher. He wrote:,UNGD
USA,1983,"""When we get to the point, as we one day will, that both sides know that in any outbreak of general hostilities, regardless of the element of surprise, destruction will be both reciprocal and complete, possibly we will have sense enough to meet at the conference table with the understanding that the era of armaments has ended and the human race must conform its actions to this truth or die.""",UNGD
USA,1983,"He went on to say,",UNGD
USA,1983,""". . .we have already come to the point where safety cannot be assumed by arms alone . . . their usefulness becomes concentrated more and more in their characteristics as deterrents than in instruments with which to obtain victory . . ."".",UNGD
USA,1983,"41.	As we persevere in the search for a more secure world we must do everything we can to let diplomacy triumph. Diplomacy, the most honorable of professions, can bring the most blessed of gifts, the gift of peace. If we succeed, the world will find an excitement and accomplishment in peace beyond that which could ever be imagined through violence and war.",UNGD
USA,1983,"I want to leave you today with a message I have often spoken about to the citizens of my own country, especially in times when I have felt they were discouraged and unsure. I say it to you with as much hope and heart as I have said it to my own people. You have the right to dream great dreams. You have the right to seek a better world for your people. A11 of us have the responsibility to work for that better world and, as caring peaceful peoples, think what a powerful force for good we could be. Let us regain the dream the United Nations once dreamed.",UNGD
USA,1984,"First of all, I wish to congratulate you, Mr. Lusaka, on your election as President of the General Assembly. I wish you every success in carrying out the responsibilities of that high international office.",UNGD
USA,1984,"3.	It is an honour to be here, and I thank you all for your gracious invitation. I would speak in support of the two great goals that led to the formation of the United Nations—the cause of peace and the cause of human dignity.",UNGD
USA,1984,"4.	The responsibility of the General Assembly—the peaceful resolution of disputes between peoples and nations—can be discharged successfully only if we recognize the great common ground upon which we all stand: our fellowship as members of the human race, our oneness as inhabitants of this planet, our place as representatives of billions of our countrymen whose fondest hope remains the end to war and to the repression of the human spirit. These are the important, central realities that bind us, that per-",UNGD
USA,1984,"us to dream of a future without the antagonisms of the past. And, just as shadows can be seen only where there is light, so, too, can we overcome what is wrong only if we remember how much is right; and we will resolve what divides us only if we remember how much more unites us. This chamber has heard enough about the problems and dangers ahead; today let us dare to speak of a future that is bright and hopeful and can be ours only if we seek it. I believe that future is far nearer than most of us would dare to hope.",UNGD
USA,1984,"5.	At the start of this decade one scholar at the Hudson Institute noted that mankind also had undergone enormous changes for the better in the past two centuries, changes which are not always readily noticed or written about.",UNGD
USA,1984,"6.	""Up until 200 years ago, there were relatively few people in the world,"" he wrote. ""All human societies were poor. Disease and early death dominated most people's lives. People were ignorant, and largely at the mercy of forces of nature.""",UNGD
USA,1984,"7.	""Now,"" he said, ""we are somewhere near the middle of a process of economic development ... At the end of that process, almost no one will live in a country as poor as the richest country of the past. There will be many more people .. . living long, healthy lives, with immense knowledge and more to learn than anybody has time for."" They will be ""able to cope with the forces of nature, and almost indifferent to distance.""",UNGD
USA,1984,"8.	We do live today, as that scholar suggested, in the middle of one of the most important and dramatic periods in human history—one in which all of us can serve as catalysts for an era of world peace and unimagined human freedom and dignity.",UNGD
USA,1984,"9.	Today I would like to report to you, as distinguished and influential members of the world community, on what the United States has been attempting to do to help move the world closer to this new era. On many fronts enormous progress has been made, and I think our efforts are complemented by the trend of history.",UNGD
USA,1984,"10.	If we look closely enough, I believe we can see all the world moving towards a deeper appreciation of the value of human freedom in both its political and its economic manifestations. This is partially motivated by a world-wide desire for economic growth and higher standards of living. And there is an increasing realization that economic freedom is a prelude to economic progress and growth and is intricately and inseparably linked to political freedom.",UNGD
USA,1984,"11.	Everywhere, people and Governments are beginning to recognize that the secret of a progressive new world is to take advantage of the creativity of the human spirit; to encourage innovation and individual enterprise; to reward hard work; and to reduce barriers to the free flow of trade and information.",UNGD
USA,1984,"12.	Our opposition to economic restrictions and trade barriers is consistent with our view of economic freedom and human progress. We believe such barriers pose a particularly dangerous threat to the developing nations and their chance to share in world prosperity through expanded export markets. Tomorrow, at the International Monetary Fund, I will address this question more fully, including America's desire for more open trading markets throughout the world.",UNGD
USA,1984,"13.	This desire to cut down trade barriers and our open advocacy of freedom as the engine of human progress are two of the important ways the United States and the American people hope to assist in bringing about a world where prosperity is commonplace, conflict an aberration, and human dignity and freedom a way of life.",UNGD
USA,1984,14.	Let me place these steps more in context by briefly outlining the major goals of American foreign,UNGD
USA,1984,A/39/PV.4 ,UNGD
USA,1984,,UNGD
USA,1984,"policy and then exploring with you the practical ways we are attempting to further freedom and prevent war. By that I mean, first, how we have moved to strengthen ties with old allies and new friends; secondly, what we are doing to help avoid the regional conflicts that could contain the seeds of world conflagration; and thirdly, the status of our efforts with the Soviet Union to reduce the levels of arms.",UNGD
USA,1984,"15.	Let me begin with a word about the objectives of American foreign policy, which have been consistent since the post-war era and which fuelled the formation of the United Nations and were incorporated into the Charter of the United Nations itself.",UNGD
USA,1984,"16.	The Charter states two overriding goals: ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind"" and ""to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small"".",UNGD
USA,1984,17.	The founders of the United Nations understood full well the relationship between these two goals. And I want you to know that the Government of the United States will continue to view this concern for human rights as the moral centre of our foreign policy. We can never look at anyone's freedom as a bargaining chip in world politics. Our hope is for a time when all the people of the world can enjoy the blessings of personal liberty.,UNGD
USA,1984,18.	But I would like also to emphasize that our concern for protecting human rights is part of our concern for protecting the peace.,UNGD
USA,1984,"19.	The answer is for all nations to fulfil the obligations they freely assumed under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Declaration states that: ""The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections"". The Declaration also includes the right of everyone: ""to form and to join trade unions,"" ""to own property alone as well as in association with others,"" ""to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country,"" and to enjoy ""freedom of opinion and expression"". Perhaps the most graphic example of the relationship between human rights and peace is the right of peace groups to exist and to promote their views. In fact, the treatment of peace groups may be a litmus test of a Government's true desire for peace.",UNGD
USA,1984,"20.	In addition to emphasizing this tie between the advocacy of human rights and the prevention of war, the United States has taken important steps, as I mentioned earlier, to prevent world conflict. The starting-point and comer-stone of our foreign policy is our alliance and partnership with our fellow democracies. For 35 years, the North Atlantic alliance has guaranteed the peace in Europe. In both Europe and Asia, our alliances have been the vehicle for a great reconciliation among nations that had fought bitter wars in decades and centuries past. And here in the western hemisphere, North and South are being lifted on the tide of freedom and are joined in a common effort to foster peaceful economic development.",UNGD
USA,1984,"21.	We are proud of our association with all those countries that share our commitment to freedom, human rights, the rule of law—and international peace. Indeed, the bulwark of security that the democratic alliance provides is essential, and remains essential, to the maintenance of world peace. Every alliance involves burdens and obligations, but these are far less than the risks and sacrifices that would result if the peace-loving nations were divided and neglectful of their common security. The people of the United States will remain faithful to their commitments.",UNGD
USA,1984,"22.	But the United States is also faithful to its alliances and friendships with scores of nations in the developed and developing worlds with differing political systems, cultures and traditions. The development of ties between the United States and China—a significant global event of the last dozen years—shows our willingness to improve relations with countries ideologically very different from ours.",UNGD
USA,1984,"23.	We are ready to be the friend of any country that is a friend to us and a friend of peace. And we respect genuine non-alignment. Our own nation was born in revolution; we helped promote the process of decolonization that brought about the independence of so many members of this body, and we are proud of that history.",UNGD
USA,1984,"24.	We are proud, too, of our role in the formation of the United Nations and our support of the Organization over the years. And let me again emphasize our unwavering commitment to a central principle of the United Nations system, the principle of universality, both here and in the United Nations technical agencies around the world. If universality is ignored, if nations are expelled illegally, then the United Nations itself cannot be expected to succeed.",UNGD
USA,1984,"25.	The United States welcomes diversity and peaceful competition; we do not fear the trends of history. We are not ideologically rigid; we do have principles and we will stand by them, but we will also seek the friendship and goodwill of all, both old friends and new.",UNGD
USA,1984,"26.	We have always sought to lend a hand to help others—from our relief efforts in Europe after the First World War to the Marshall Plan and massive foreign assistance programmes after the Second World War. Since 1946, the United States has provided over $115 billion in economic aid to developing countries, and today it provides about one third of the nearly $90 billion in financial resources, public and private, that flows to the developing world. And the United States imports about one third of the manufactured exports of the developing world.",UNGD
USA,1984,"27.	But any economic progress, as well as any movement in the direction of greater understanding between the nations of the world, is, of course, endangered by the prospect of conflict at both the global and the regional levels. In a few minutes I will turn to the menace of conflict on a world-wide scale and discuss the status of negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union. But permit me first to address the critical problem of regional conflicts, for history displays tragic evidence that it is these conflicts which can set off the sparks leading to world-wide conflagration.",UNGD
USA,1984,"28.	In a glass display case across the hall from the Oval Office at the White House there is a gold medal—the Nobel Peace Prize won by Theodore Roosevelt for his contribution in mediating the Russo-Japanese War in 1905. It was the first such prize won by an American, and it is part of a tradition of which the American people are very ",UNGD
USA,1984,"proud, a tradition that is being continued today in many regions of the globe.",UNGD
USA,1984,"29.	We are engaged, for example, in diplomacy to resolve conflicts in southern Africa, working with the front-line States and our partners in the Contact Group. Mozambique and South Africa have reached a historic accord on non-aggression and co-operation; South Africa and Angola have agreed on a disengagement of forces from Angola, and the groundwork has been laid for the independence of Namibia, with virtually all aspects of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) agreed upon. Let me add that the United States considers it a moral imperative that South Africa's racial policies evolve peacefully but decisively towards a system compatible with basic norms of justice, liberty and human dignity. I am pleased that American companies in South Africa, by providing equal employment opportunities, are contributing to the economic advancement of the black population. But clearly, much more must be done.",UNGD
USA,1984,"30.	In Central America, the United States has lent support to a diplomatic process to restore regional peace and security. We have committed substantial resources to promote economic development and social progress.",UNGD

USA,1984,"50.	First, I said, we need to find ways to reduce, and eventually to eliminate, the threat and use of force in solving international disputes. Our concern over the potential for nuclear war cannot deflect us from the terrible human tragedies occurring every day in the regional conflicts I have just discussed. Together we have a particular responsibility to contribute to political solutions to these problems, rather than to exacerbate them through the provision of even more weapons.",UNGD
USA,1984,"51.	I propose that our two countries agree to embark on periodic consultations at policy level about regional problems. We will be prepared, if the Soviets agree, to make senior experts available at regular intervals for in-depth exchanges of views. I have asked Secretary of State Shultz to explore this with Foreign Minister Gromyko. Spheres of influence are a thing of the past. Differences between American and Soviet interests are not. The objectives of this political dialogue will be to help avoid miscalculation, reduce the potential risk of United States-Soviet confrontation and help the people in areas of conflict to find peaceful solutions.",UNGD
USA,1984,52.	The United States and the Soviet Union have achieved agreements of historic importance on some regional issues. The Austrian State Treaty and the Berlin accords are notable and lasting examples. Let us resolve to achieve similar agreements in the future.,UNGD
USA,1984,"53.	Our second task must be to find ways to reduce the vast stockpiles of armaments in the world. I am committed to redoubling our negotiating efforts to achieve real results: in Geneva, a complete ban on chemical weapons; in Vienna, real reductions—to lower and equal levels—in Soviet and American, Warsaw Pact and North Atlantic Treaty Organization conventional forces; in Stockholm, concrete practical measures to enhance mutual confidence, to reduce the risk of war and to reaffirm commitments concerning non-use of force; in the field of nuclear testing, improvements in verification essential to ensure compliance with the threshold test-ban and peaceful nuclear explosions agreements; and in the field of non-proliferation, close co-operation to strengthen the international institutions and practices aimed at halting the Spread of nuclear weapons, together with redoubled efforts to meet the legitimate expectation of all nations that the Soviet Union and the United States will substantially reduce their own nuclear arsenals. We and the Soviets have agreed to upgrade our hotline communications facility, and our discussions of nuclear non-proliferation in recent years have been useful to both sides. We think there are other possibilities for improving communications in this area that deserve serious exploration.",UNGD
USA,1984,"54.	I believe the proposal of the Soviet Union for opening United States-Soviet talks at Vienna provides an important opportunity to advance these objectives. We have been prepared to discuss a wide range of issues of concern to both sides, such as the relationship between defensive and offensive forces and what has been called the militarization of space. During the talks we would consider what measures of restraint both sides might take while negotiations proceeded. However, any agreement must logically depend upon our ability to get the competition in offensive arms under control and to achieve genuine stability at substantially lower levels of nuclear arms.",UNGD
USA,1984,55.	Our approach in all these areas will be designed to take into account concerns the Soviet Union has voiced. It will attempt to provide a basis for a historic breakthrough in arms control. I am disappointed that we were not able to open our meeting at Vienna earlier this month on the date originally proposed by the Soviet Union. I hope we can begin these talks by the end of the year or shortly thereafter.,UNGD
USA,1984,"56.	The third task I set in January was to establish a better working relationship between the Soviet Union and the United States, one marked by greater co-operation and understanding.",UNGD

USA,1984,"58.	We have also offered to increase significantly the amount of United States grain for purchase by the Soviets and to provide the Soviets with a direct fishing allocation off United States coasts. But there is much more we could do together. I feel particularly strongly about breaking down the barriers between the peoples of the United States and the Soviet Union and between our political, military and other leaders.",UNGD
USA,1984,"59.	AH of these steps that I have mentioned, and especially the arms control negotiations, are extremely important to a step-by-step process towards peace. But let me also say that we need to extend the arms control process, to build a bigger umbrella under which it can operate—a road-map, as it were, showing where during the next 20 years or so these individual efforts can lead. This can greatly assist step-by-step negotiations and enable us to avoid having all our hopes or expectations ride on any single set or series of negotiations. If progress is temporarily halted at one set of talks, this newly established framework for arms control could help us take up the slack at other negotiations.",UNGD
USA,1984,"60.	Today, to the great end of lifting the dread of nuclear war from the peoples of the Earth, I invite the leaders of the world to join in a new beginning. We ",UNGD
USA,1984,"need a fresh approach to reducing international tensions. History demonstrates beyond controversy that, just as the arms competition has its roots in political suspicions and anxieties, so it can be channelled in more stabilizing directions and eventually be eliminated, if those political suspicions and anxieties are addressed as well.",UNGD
USA,1984,"61.	Towards this end I will suggest to the Soviet Union that we institutionalize regular ministerial or cabinet-level meetings between our two countries on the whole agenda of issues before us, including the problem of needless obstacles to understanding. To take but one idea for discussion, in such talks we could consider the exchange of outlines of five-year military plans for weapons development and our schedules of intended procurement. We would also welcome the exchange of observers at military exercises and locations. And I propose that we find a way for Soviet experts to come to the United States nuclear-test site, and for ours to go to theirs, to measure directly the yields of tests of nuclear weapons. We should work towards having such arrangements in place by next spring. I hope that the Soviet Union will co-operate in this undertaking and reciprocate in a manner that will enable the two countries to establish the basis for verification for effective limits on underground nuclear testing.",UNGD
USA,1984,"62.	I believe such talks could work rapidly towards developing a new climate of policy understanding, one that is essential if crises are to be avoided and real arms control is to be negotiated. Of course, summit meetings have a useful role to play. But they need to be carefully prepared, and the benefit here is that meetings at the ministerial level would provide the kind of progress that is the best preparation for higher-level talks between ourselves and the Soviet leaders.",UNGD
USA,1984,"63.	How much progress we will make, and at what pace, I cannot say, but we have a moral obligation to try and try again.",UNGD
USA,1984,"64.	Some may dismiss such proposals and my own optimism as simplistic American idealism. And they will point to the burdens of the modem world and to history.

USA,1985,"While the most direct path to a safer world is through equitable, verifiable reductions, we also see value in verifiable limitations on nuclear testing. For that reason, President Reagan, in his speech to this body last year, proposed that the United States and the Soviet Union exchange visits of experts at test sites to measure directly the yields of nuclear-weapon test. This would significantly improve confidence in the verifiability of proposed treaty limits on underground testing. The Soviet Union rejected this offer. Nevertheless, last July, the President issued an unconditional invitation for a Soviet team to observe and measure a nuclear test at the Nevada Test Site. We again call on the Soviet Union to take up this offer, which is a concrete, positive step toward verifiable restrictions on nuclear testing.",UNGD
USA,1985," When the Anti-Ballistic-Missile Treaty was signed in 1972 it was assumed that tight limits on defensive systems would make possible real reductions in strategic offensive arms. But the Soviet Union has never agreed to any meaningful reductions in offensive nuclear arms. Instead, it has continued an unprecedented military build-up - particularly in heavy intercontinental ballistic missiles with a first-strike capability - which is eroding the basis on which deterrence has rested for decades. The strategy of reliance on offensive retaliation to preserve deterrence and prevent war thus is being called into question by Soviet actions.",UNGD
USA,1985,"The answer is, first, for us both to agree that strategically significant, verifiable reductions in the numbers and destructive potential of offensive weapons. But there are additional ways to redress the problem. President Reagan has directed our scientists and engineers to examine, in the light of new technologies and fully in accord with the Anti-Ballistic-Missile Treaty - the feasibility of defense against ballistic-missile attack. Strategic defense could give our children and grandchildren a safer world. We would continue to rely on deterrence to prevent war, but deterrence would be based more on denying success to a potential attacker and less on threatening massive mutual destruction. Such a means of deterrence should be safer and more stable. Our goal is not to achieve superiority but to add to the security of both sides. As former Soviet Premier Kosygin said, an anti-missile system ""is intended not for killing people but for saving human lives"". The Soviet Premier was right.",UNGD

In the past 20 years the",UNGD

The Soviets have the world's most active military space program, last year conducting about 100 space launches, some 80 per cent of which were purely military in nature, compared to a total of about 20 United States space launches. The Soviets know that, too. They deploy the world's only anti-ballistic-missile system, whose nuclear-armed interceptors and other components are undergoing extensive modernization. They are researching many of the same new technologies as we, and are ahead in some. And the Soviet Union has the world's only extensively tested and fully operational anti-satellite system. The Soviet leaders know full well their own efforts in these fields. Their propaganda about American programs is blatantly one-sided and not to be taken seriously.",UNGD

It would therefore be suicidal to return to the protectionism of the 1920s and 1930s which helped bring on the great depression. Protectionism is not a cure; it is a disease, a disease that could cripple all of us. Trade must be free, open and fair. The United States will work to see that it is.

And I did not hesitate to tell Mr. Gorbachev our view of the source of that mistrust: the Soviet Union's record of seeking to impose its ideology and rule on others.

Before discussing the proposals, let us be clear about which weapons are the most dangerous and threatening to peace. The threat does not come from defensive systems, which are a shield against attack, but from offensive weapons - ballistic missiles that hurtle through space and can wreak mass destruction on the surface of the Earth - especially the Soviet Union's heavy, accurate ICBMs, with multiple warheads, which have no counterparts in size or number in any other country.",UNGD
USA,1986,"That is why the United States has long urged radical, equitable, verifiable reductions in these offensive systems. Note that I said reduction; for this is the real purpose of arms control: not just to codify the levels of today's arsenals, not just to channel their further expansion, but to reduce them in ways that will reduce the danger of war. Indeed, the United States believes the prospect of a future without such weapons cf mass destruction must be the ultimate goal of arms control.",UNGD

Since then, the Soviets have made detailed proposals which, while not acceptable to us, appear to represent a serious effort. So we continue to seek a 50 per cent reduction of American and Soviet arsenals - with the central focus on the reduction of ballistic missile warheads. If the Soviet Union wants only a lesser reduction, however, we are prepared to consider it but as an interim measure. In other provisions as well, we have sought to take account of Soviet concerns. So there has been movement.",UNGD

I can tell representatives that the exchanges between our two sides this summer could well have marked the beginning of serious, productive negotiation on arms reductions.

USA,1986,"For too long a time, however, the Soviet response has been to downplay the need for offensive reductions. When the United States began work technology to make offensive nuclear weapons obsolete some day, the Soviets tried to make that the main issue - as if the main danger to strategic stability was a defense against missiles that is still on the drawing boards, rather than the menacing ballistic missiles themselves that already exist in excessive numbers.",UNGD
USA,1986,"Still, the United States recognizes that both the offensive and defensive sides of the strategic equation must be addressed. And we have gone far to meet Soviet concerns expressed about the potential offensive use of strategic defensive systems. I have offered firm and concrete assurances that our strategic defense initiative could never be used to deploy weapons in space that can cause mass destruction on earth. I have pointed out that the radical reduction we seek now in offensive arsenals would be additional insurance that strategic defense initiative cannot be used to support a first-strike strategy. Our preference from the beginning has been to move forward co-operatively with the Soviets on strategic defenses, so that neither side will feel threatened and both can benefit from the strategic revolution that strategic defense initiative represents.",UNGD

In the Stockholm Conference a major advance has been achieved: a concrete new set of military confidence-building measures which",UNGD

I pointed out how difficult it is for the United States to accept Soviet assurances of peaceful intent when 126,000 Soviet troops prosecute a vicious war against the Afghan people; when 140,000 Soviet-backed Vietnamese soldiers wage war on the people of Cambodia; when 1,700 Soviet advisers and 2,500 Cuban combat troops are involved in military planning and operations in Ethiopia; when 1,300 Soviet military advisers and 36,000 Cuban troops direct and participate in combat operations to prop up an unpopular, repressive regime in Angola; when hundreds of millions of dollars in Soviet arms and Soviet-bloc advisers help a dictatorial regime in Nicaragua try to subvert and betray a popular revolution.",UNGD
USA,1986,"The danger inherent in these conflicts must be recognized. Marxist-Leninist regimes tend to wage war as readily against their neighbors as they routinely do against their own people. In fact, the internal and external wars often become indistinguishable. In Afghanistan, for example, the puppet regime has announced its intention to relocate tens of thousands of people from border areas, Can anyone doubt this will be done in classic communist style - by force? Many will die, to make it easier for the Soviets and their satellite troops to intimidate Pakistan.",UNGD

So, once again, I propose a three-point peace process for the resolution of regional conflicts: first, talks between the warring parties themselves, without which an end to violence and national reconciliation are impossible; secondly, discussions between the united States and the Soviet Union - not to impose solutions but to support peace talks and eventually eliminate the supply of arms ^and the proxy troops from abroad; thirdly, if the talks are successful, joint efforts to welcome each country back into the world economy and the community of nations that respect human rights.",UNGD

Now more than ever, it is the responsibility of the Soviet Union to take action and demonstrate that they too are continuing the dialog for peace.",UNGD

I also said that peace conferences, arms negotiations and proposals for treaties could make sense only if they were part of a wider context, a context in which we sought to explore and resolve the deeper underlying differences between us.

Indeed, that very building in Geneva, where important negotiations have taken place - those on the Geneva Accords on Afghanistan, and the Iran-Iraq negotiations, for example - we see today as stone-like testimony to a failed dream of peace in another time. The Palais des Nations was the headquarters of the League of Nations, an institution that was to symbolize an end to all war. Yet that institution and its noble purpose ended with the Second World War; ended because the chance of peace was not seized in the 1930s by the nations of the world, ended because humanity did not find the courage to isolate the aggressors, to reject schemes of government that served the State, not the people.

Or do we continue the work of the founders of this institution, and see to it that, at last, freedom is enshrined and humanity knows war no longer, and that this place, this floor, shall be truly ""the world's last battlefield""?",UNGD
USA,1988,"We are determined that it shall be so. So we turn now to the agenda of peace. Let us begin by addressing a concern that was much on my mind when I met with Mr. Gorbachev in the Kremlin as well as on the minds of Soviet citizens I met in Moscow. It is also an issue that I know is of immediate importance to the members of this Assembly who, this fall, commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.",UNGD
USA,1988,"That Declaration says plainly what those who seek peace can forget only at the greatest peril that peace rests on one foundation; observance of the ""inalienable rights of all members of the human family"". In a century where human rights have been denied by totalitarian governments on a scale never before seen in history, with so many millions deliberately starved or eliminated as a matter of State policy - a history, it has been said, of blood, stupidity and barbed wire - few can wonder why peace has proved so elusive.	",UNGD
USA,1988,"Well, let us understand. If we would have peace, we must acknowledge the elementary rights of our fellow human beings, in our own land and in other lands. If we would have peace, the trampling of the human spirit must cease. Human rights is not for some, some of the time. Human rights, as the Universal Declaration adopted by this Assembly in 1948 proclaims, is ""for all peoples and all nations"". And for all time.",UNGD
USA,1988,"This regard for human rights as the foundation of peace is at the heart of the United Nations. Those who starve in Ethiopia, those who die among the Kurds, those who face racial injustice in South Africa, those who still cannot write or speak freely in the Soviet Union, those who cannot worship in the Ukraine, those who struggle for life and freedom on boats in the South China Sea, those who cannot publish or assemble in Managua - all of these are more than just an item on your agenda. It must be a first concern, an issue above others. For when human rights concerns are not paramount at the United Nations - when the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is not honoured in these halls and meeting rooms - then the very credibility of this Organization is at stake, the very purpose of its existence in question.",UNGD
USA,1988,"That is why, when progress is made in human rights, the United Nations grows stronger and the United States is glad of it. For example, following a two-year ¡ effort led by the United States, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights took a major step towards ending the double standards and cynicism that had characterized too much of its past. For years, Cuba, a blatant violator of its citizens' human rights, has escaped United Nations censure or even scrutiny. This year, Cuba has responded to pressure generated by the Commission on Human Rights by accepting an investigation into its human rights abuses. Fidel Castro has already begun to free some political prisoners, improve prison conditions, and tolerate the existence of a small, independent national human rights group.",UNGD
USA,1988,"More must be done. The United Nations must be relentless and unyielding in seeking change, in Cuba and elsewhere. And we must also see to it that the Universal Declaration itself is not debased with episodes like the resolution ""Zionism is racism"". Respect for human rights is the first and fundamental mission of this body, the most elementary obligation of its members. Indeed, wherever one turns in the world today, there is a new awareness, a growing passion for human rights. The people of the world become united: new groups, new coalitions form, coalitions that commit: government, that work against discrimination, that fight religious or political repression, unlawful imprisonment, torture or execution. As those I spoke to at Spaso House said to me last June: Such movements make a difference.",UNGD
USA,1988,"Turning now to regional conflicts, we feel again the uplift of hope. In the Gulf War between Iran and Iraq - one of the bloodiest conflicts since the Second World War - we have a cease-fire. The resolution and the firmness of the allied nations in keeping the Persian Gulf open to international shipping not only upheld the rule of law, it helped prevent further spread of the conflict and laid the basis for peace. So, too, the Security Council's decisive resolution in July a year ago has become the blueprint for a peaceful Gulf. Let this war - a war in which there has been no victor or vanquished, only victims - let this war end now. Let both Iran and Iraq co-operate with the Secretary-General and the Security Council in implementing resolution 598 (1978). Let peace come.",UNGD
USA,1988,"Moving on to a second region, I would recall that when I first addressed the United Nations General Assembly in 1983, world attention was focused on the brutal invasion and illegal occupation of Afghanistan. After nearly nine long years of war, the courage and determination of the Afghan people and the Afghan freedom fighters have held sway - and today, an end to the occupation is in sight. On April 14, the USSR signed the Geneva Accords, which were negotiated under United Nations auspices by Pakistan and the Kabul regime. We encourage the Soviet Union to complete its troop withdrawal at the earliest possible date, so that the Afghan people can freely determine their future without further outside interference.",UNGD
USA,1988,"In southern Africa, too, years of patient diplomacy and support for those in Angola who seek self-determination are having their effect. We look forward to an accord between the Governments of Angola, Cuba, and South Africa that will bring about a complete withdrawal of all foreign troops - primarily Cuban - from Angola. We look forward as well to full implementation of United Nations Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and our longstanding goal of independence for Namibia. We continue to support a growing consensus among African leaders who also believe there can be no end to conflict in the region until there is national reconciliation within Angola.",UNGD
USA,1988,"There are new hopes for Cambodia, a nation whose freedom and independence we seek just as avidly as we sought the freedom and independence of Afghanistan. We urge the rapid removal of all Vietnamese troops and a settlement that will prevent the return of the Khmer Rouge to power, permitting instead the establishment of a genuinely representative government - a government that will, at last, respect fully the rights of the people of Cambodia and end the hideous suffering they have so bravely and needlessly borne.",UNGD
USA,1988,"In other critical areas, we applaud the Secretary-General's efforts to structure a referendum on the Western Sahara. In the Mediterranean, direct talks between Greek and Turkish Cypriot common ties hold much promise for accord in that divided island nation. Finally, we look to a peaceful solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict. So, too, the unnatural division of Europe remains a critical obstacle to Soviet-American relations. ",UNGD
USA,1988,"In most of these areas, then, we see progress and, again, we are glad of it. Only a few years ago, all of these and other conflicts were burning dangerously out of control. Indeed, the invasion of Afghanistan and the apparent failure of will among democratic and peace-loving nations to deter such events seemed to cause a climate where aggression by nations large and small was epidemic, a climate the world had not seen since the 1930s. Only this time, larger war was avoided - avoided because the free and peaceful nations of the world recovered their strength of purpose and will. And now the United Nations is providing valuable assistance in helping this epidemic to recede.",UNGD
USA,1988,"And because we are resolved to keep it so, I would be remiss in my duty if I did not now take note here of the one exception to progress in regional conflicts. I refer here to the continuing deterioration of human rights in Nicaragua and the refusal of the tiny elite now ruling that nation to honour promises of democracy made to their own people and to the international community. This elite - in calling itself revolutionary - seeks no real revolution; the use of the term is subterfuge, deception for hiding the oldest, most corrupt vice of alls man's age-old will to power, his lust to control the lives and steal the freedom of others.",UNGD
USA,1988,"That is why, as President, I will continue to urge the Congress and the American public to stand behind those who resist this attempt to impose a totalitarian regime on the people of Nicaragua; that the United States will continue to stand with those who are threatened by this regime's aggression against its neighbours in Central America.",UNGD
USA,1988,"Today, I also call on the Soviet Union to show in Central America the same spirit of constructive realism it has shown in other regional conflicts; to assist in bringing conflict in Central America to a close by halting the flow of billions of dollars worth of arms and ammunition to the Sandinista regime; a regime whose goals of regional domination, while ultimately doomed, can continue to cause great suffering to the people of that area and risk to Soviet-American relations unless action is taken now.",UNGD
USA,1988,"With regard to the arms reduction agenda, I have already mentioned the importance of the INF Treaty and the momentum developed in the strategic arms reduction talks (START). The draft START treaty is a lengthy process filled with bracketed language designating sections of disagreement between the two sides. But through this summer in Geneva, those brackets have diminished; there is every reason to believe this process can continue. I can tell this Assembly that it is highly doubtful such a treaty can be accomplished in a few months, but I can tell you that a year from now is a possibility - more than a possibility. But we have no deadline. No agreement is better than a bad agreement. The United States remains hopeful, and we acknowledge the spirit of co-operation shown by the Soviet Union in these negotiations. We also look for that spirit to be applied to our concerns about compliance with existing agreements.",UNGD
USA,1988,"So, too, our discussions on nuclear testing and defence and space have been useful. But let me here stress to the General Assembly that much of the momentum in nuclear-arms-control negotiations is due to technological progress itself, especially in the potential for space-based defensive systems. I believe that the determination of the United States to research and develop and, when ready, deploy such defensive systems - systems targeted to destroy missiles, not people - accounts for a large share of the progress made in recent years in Geneva. With such systems, for the first time, in case of accidental launch or the act of a madman somewhere, major Powers will not be faced with the single option of massive retaliation, but will instead have the chance of a saner choice: to shield against an attack instead of avenging it. So, too, as defensive systems grow in effectiveness, they reduce the threat and the value of greater and greater offensive arsenals. Only recently, briefings I have received in the Oval Office indicate that progress toward such systems may be even more rapid and less costly than we had at first thought. Today, the United States reaffirms its commitment to its strategic defence initiative and our offer to share the benefits of strategic defences with others.",UNGD
USA,1988,"And yet, even as diplomatic and technological progress holds out the hope of at last diminishing the awful cloud of nuclear terror we have lived under in the post-war era, even at this moment another ominous terror is loose once again in the world, a terror we thought the world had put behind, a terror that looms at us now from the long-buried past, from ghostly, scarring trenches and the haunting, wan faces of millions dead in one of the most inhumane conflicts of all time.",UNGD
USA,1988,"Poison gas; chemical warfare: the terror of it; the horror of it! We condemn it. The use of chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war, beyond its tragic human toll, jeopardizes the moral and legal strictures that have held those weapons in check since the First World War. Let this tragedy spark reaffirmation of the Geneva Protocol outlawing the use of chemical weapons. I call upon the signatories to that Protocol, as well as other concerned States, to convene a conference to consider actions that we can take together to reverse the serious erosion of this treaty. We urge all nations to co-operate in negotiating a verifiable, truly global ban on chemical weapons at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva.",UNGD
USA,1988,"It is incumbent upon all civilized nations to ban, once and for all - and on a verifiable and global basis - the use of chemical and gas warfare.",UNGD
USA,1988,"Finally, we must redouble our efforts to stop further proliferation of nuclear weapons in the world. Likewise, proliferation in other high-technology weapons such as ballistic missiles, is reaching global proportions, exacerbating regional rivalries in ways that can have global implications. The number of potential suppliers is growing at an alarming rate, and more must be done to halt the spread of these weapons. This was a matter of discussion last week between Secretary Shultz and Foreign Minister Shevardnadze. Talks between American and Soviet experts begin on this today; and we hope to see a multilateral effort to avoid having areas of tension like the Middle East becoming even more deadly battlegrounds than they already are.",UNGD
USA,1988,"Rut in most of these areas we see not only progress but also the potential for an increasingly vital role for multilateral efforts and institutions like the United Nations. That is why now more than ever the United Nations must continue to increase its effectiveness through budget and programme reform. The United Nations already is enacting sweeping measures affecting personnel reductions, budgeting by consensus, and the establishment of programme priorities. These actions are extremely important. The progress on reforms has allowed me to release funds withheld under congressional restrictions. I expect that the reform programme will continue and that further funds will be released in our new fiscal year.",UNGD
USA,1988,"Let me say here that we congratulate the United Nations on the work it has done in three areas of special concern. First, our struggle against the scourge of terrorism and State-sponsored terrorism must continue; and we must also end the scourge of hostage-taking. Second, the work of the World Health Organization in co-ordinating and advancing research on AIDS is vital. All international efforts in this area must be redoubled. The AIDS crisis is a grave one; we must move as one to meet it. ",UNGD
USA,1988,"So, too, is the drug crisis. We are moving now toward a new anti-drug-trafficking convention. This important treaty will be completed in December. I am confident that other strong United Nations drug-control programmes will also follow. The American people are profoundly concerned and deeply angered. We will not tolerate the drug traffickers. We mean to make war on them - and we believe this is one war the United Nations can endorse and participate in. Yes, the United Nations is a better place than it was eight years ago - and so, too, is the world. But the real issue of reform in the United Nations is not limited to fiscal and administrative improvements; it includes also a higher sort of reform, an intellectual and philosophical reform, a reform of old views about the relationship between the individual and the State. ",UNGD
USA,1988,"Few developments, for example, have been more encouraging to the United States than the special session on Africa that this body held two and a half years ago - a session at which the Members of the United Nations joined in calling as one for free-market incentives and a lessening of State controls to spur economic development. ",UNGD
USA,1988,"At one of the first international assemblies of my presidency, in Cancun, Mexico, I said that history demonstrates that, time and again, in place after place, economic growth and human progress make their greatest strides in countries that encourage economic freedom; that individual farmers, labourers, owners, traders and managers are the heart and soul of development. Trust them, because where they are allowed to create and build, where they are given a personal stake in deciding economic policies and benefiting from their success, societies become more dynamic, prosperous, progressive and free. We believe in freedom; we know that it works.",UNGD
USA,1988,"This is the immutable lesson of the post-war era: that freedom works; that, even more, freedom and peace work together. Every year that passes, everywhere in the world, this lesson is taking hold - from the People's Republic of China to Cameroon, from Bolivia to Botswana, and, yes, in the citadel of Marxism-Leninism itself. No, my country did not invent this synergy of peace and freedom, but, believe me, we impose no restrictions on the free export of our more than two centuries of experience with it. Free people, blessed by economic opportunity and protected by laws that respect the dignity of the individual, are not driven towards war or the domination of others. Here, then, is the way to world peace. But we Americans champion freedom not only because it is practical and beneficial but because it is also just, morally right.",UNGD
USA,1988,Here I should like to note that I have addressed this assemblage more often than any of my predecessors and that this is the last occasion on which I shall do so. Therefore I hope that I may be permitted some closing reflections.,UNGD
USA,1988,"The world is currently witnessing another celebration of international co-operation. At the Olympics we see nations joining together in the competition of sports, and we see young people, who know precious little of the resentments of their elders, coming together as one.",UNGD
USA,1988,"One of our young athletes, from a home of modest means, said that she drew the strength for her achievement from another source of wealth. ""We were rich as a family"" she said about the love she was given and the values she was taught. I dare to hope that in the sentiment of that young athlete we see a sign of the rediscovery of old and tested values; values such as family - the first and most important unit of society, where all values and learning begin, an institution to be cherished and protected·, values, too, such as work, community, freedom and faith, for it is here we find the deeper rationale for the cause of human rights and world peace.",UNGD
USA,1988,"Our own experience on this continent, the American experience, though brief, has had one unmistakable encounter, an insistence on the preservation of one sacred truth: it is a truth that our first President, our founding father, passed on in the first farewell address made to the American people; it is a truth that I hope you will permit me to mention in these remarks of farewell, a truth embodied in our Declaration of Independence: that the case for inalienable rights, the idea of human dignity, the notion of conscience above compulsion, can be made only in the context of higher law, only in the context of what one of the founders of this Organization, Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld, called ""devotion to something which is greater and higher than we are ourselves.""",UNGD
USA,1988,"This is the endless cycle, the final truth to which humankind seems always to return - that religion and morality, faith in something higher, are prerequisites for freedom, and that justice and peace within ourselves is the first step toward justice and peace in the world and for the ages.",UNGD
USA,1988,"Yes, this is a place of great debate and grave discussion. Yet I cannot help but note here that one of our founding fathers - the most worldly of men, an internationalist, Benjamin Franklin - interrupted the proceedings of our own constitutional convention to make much the same point.",UNGD
USA,1988,"I cannot help but think this morning of other beginnings - of where and when I first read those words ""and they shall beat their swords into ploughshares"" and ""your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams"". This morning, my thoughts go to her who gave me many things in life but whose most important gift was the knowledge of the happiness and solace to be gained in prayer. It is the greatest help I have had in my presidency, and I recall here Lincoln's words when he said",UNGD

No one of them could ever have imagined that the boy from the banks of the Rock River would come to this moment and have this opportunity. But, had they been told that it would happen, I think they would have been a bit disappointed if I had not spoken here for what they knew so wells that when we grow weary of the world and its troubles, when our faith in humanity falters, it is then that we must seek contort and refreshment of spirit in a deeper source of wisdom, one greater than ourselves.",UNGD
USA,1988,"So, if future generations do say of us that in our time peace came closer, that we did bring about new seasons of truth and justice, it will be cause for pride. But it will be a cause of greater pride still if it is also said that we were wise enough to know that the deliberations of great leaders and great bodies are but an overture, that the truly majestic music, the music of freedom, justice and peace, is the music made in forgetting self and seeking in silence the will of Him who made us.",UNGD

USA,1989,"With the Assembly's permission, I should like to share one story from one of the many meetings of the Security Council. I was the Permanent Representative of the United States, and I was 45 minutes late for the meeting. All 45 minutes were filled by the first speaker to take the floor, and when I walked in and took my seat the speaker paused, with great courtesy, and said: ""I welcome the Permanent Representative of the United States. And now, for his benefit, I will start my speech all over again, from the beginning.""",UNGD
USA,1989,"That is a true story, at that moment. differences of alliance and ideology didn't matter. The universal groan that went up around that table from every representative present, and the laughter that followed united us all. Today, I would like to begin by recognising - again, a personal privilege - the current Permanent Representatives with whom I served, Ambassador Dugersuren, Ambassador Martinez Ordonez. Ambassador Pabetafika and Permanent Observer Dube. It is wonderful to look around and see so any familiar faces - foreign ministers, members of the Secretariat, and delegates. Of course, the Secretary-General, you were the Permanent representative of your country when we served together. Under-Secretary-General Farah. you were a Permanent Representative back then too. Ambassador Aguilar was here then and is now back.

USA,1989,"The United Nations was established forty-four years ago upon the ashes of war and amidst great hopes. The UN can do great things. No, the United Nations is not perfect, it is not a panacea for the world's problem. But it is a vital forum where the nations of the world seek to replace conflict with consensus, and it must remain a forum for peace. The UN has the support of the United States of America. In recent years, the war of words that is often echoed in this Hall has been giving way to a new mood. ",UNGD
USA,1989,"We have seen a welcome shift from polemics to peace-keeping. United Nations Peace-keepers have given their lives in service to the United Nations. Today, should like to remember one of those soldiers of peace, an American on a mission of peace under the United Nations flag, on a mission for all the world, a man of unquestioned bravery and unswerving, dedication to the United Nations ideal - Lieutenant-Colonel William Richard Higgins. I call on the General Assembly to condemn the murder of this soldier of peace and to call on those responsible to have the decency to return his remains to his family. Let us all - right now, right here - dedicate ourselves and our nations to the cause that Colonel Higgins served so selflessly.",UNGD
USA,1989,"The founders of this historic institution believed that it was here that the nations of the world might come to agree that law, not force, shall govern. And the United Nations can play a fundamental role in the central issue of our time, for today, there is an idea at work around the globe, an idea of undeniable force - and that idea is freedom. Freedom's advance is evident everywhere.- Central Europe and Hungary, where State and society are now in the midst of a movement towards political pluralism and a free-market economy, where the barrier that once enforced an unnatural division between Hungary and its neighbours to the west has been torn down and replaced by a new hope for the future, a new hope in freedom. We see freedom at work in Poland, where, in deference to the will of the people, the Communist Party has relinquished its monopoly on power, and indeed in the Soviet Union, where the world hears the voices of people no longer afraid to speak out or to assert the right to rule themselves.",UNGD
USA,1989,"But freedom's march is not confined to a single continent or to the developed world alone. We see the rise of freedom in Latin America where, one by one, dictatorships are giving way to democracy. We see it on the continent of Africa, where more and more nations see in the system of free enterprise salvation for economies crippled by excessive State control. East and West, North and South, on every continent, we can see the outlines of a new world of freedom.",UNGD
USA,1989,"Of course, freedom's work remains unfinished. The trend we see is not yet universal. Some regimes still stand against the tide. Some rulers still deny the right of the people to govern themselves. But now the power of prejudice and despotism is challenged. Never before have these regimes stood so isolated and alone, so out of step with the steady advance of freedom. Today we are witnessing an ideological collapse, the demise of the totalitarian idea of the omniscient, all-powerful State. There are many reasons for this collapse, but in the end one fact alone explains what we see today: advocates of the totalitarian idea saw its triumph written in the laws of history, they failed to see the love of freedom that was written in the human heart.",UNGD
USA,1989,"Two hundred years ago today, the United States - our Congress - proposed the Bill of Rights: fundamental freedoms belonging to every individual. Rights no Government can deny. Those same rights have been recognized in this congress of nations in the words of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights - a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations. From where we stand, on the threshold of this new world of freedom, the trend is clear enough. If, for those who write the history of our times, the twentieth century is remembered as the century of the state, the twenty-first century must be an era of emancipation, the age of the individual. Make no mistake, nothing can stand in the way of freedom's march. There will come a day when freedom is seen the world over to be the universal birthright of every man and woman, of every race and walk of life. Even under the worst circumstances, at the darkest of times, freedom has always remained alive - a distant dream, perhaps, but always alive.",UNGD
USA,1989,"Today, that dream is no longer distant. For the first time, for millions around the world, a new world of freedom is within reach. Today is freedom's moment. You see, the possibility now exists for the creation of a true community of nations, built on shared interests and ideals. A true community, a world where free Governments and free markets meet the rising desire of the people to control their own destiny, to live in dignity, and to exercise freely their fundamental human rights. It is time that worked together to deliver that destiny into the hands of men and women everywhere. Our challenge is to strengthen the foundations of freedom, encourage its advance and face our most urgent challenges, the global challenges of the twenty-first century: economic, health, environmental well-being, the great questions of war and peace.",UNGD
USA,1989,"First, global economic growth. During this decade, a number of developing nations have moved into the ranks of the world's most advanced economies, all of them - each and every one - powered by the engine of free enterprise. In the decade ahead, others can join their ranks, but for many nations, barriers stand in the way. In the case of some countries, these are obstacles of their own making: un-needed restrictions, regulations that act as dead weights on their own economies and obstacles to foreign trade. But other barriers to growth exist, and those, too, require effective action.",UNGD
USA,1989,"Too many developing countries struggle today under a burden of debt that makes growth all but impossible. The nations of the world deserve better opportunity to achieve a measure of control over their own economic fate and build better lives for their own people. The approach the United States has put forward - the Brady plan - will help these nations reduce that debt and, at the same time, encourage the free market reforms that will fuel economic growth.",UNGD
USA,1989,"In just two days, I will be speaking to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and I will discuss there, in more detail, the steps that our nations can take in dealing with the debt problem. But I can say now the new world of freedom is not a world where a few nations live in comfort while others live in want. The power of commerce is a force for progress. Open markets are the key to continued growth in the developing world. Today, the United States buys over one-half of the global manufactured exports that all developing nations combined sell to the industrialized world. It is time for the other advanced economies to follow suit, to create expanded opportunities for trade. I believe we will learn, in the century ahead, that many nations of the world have barely begun to tap their true potential for development. The free market and its fruits are not the special preserve of a few, they are a harvest that everyone can share.",UNGD
USA,1989,"Beyond the challenge of global growth lies another issue of global magnitude: the environment. No line drawn on a map can stop the advance of pollution. Threats to our environment have become international problems. We must develop an international approach to urgent environmental issues, one that seeks common solutions to common problems. The United Nations is already at work on the question of global warming and the effort to prevent oil spills and other disasters from fouling our seas and the air we breathe. And I will tell you now the United States will do its part. We have committed ourselves to the world-wide phase-out of chlorofluorocarbons by the year 2000. We have proposed amending our own Clean Air Act to ensure clean air for our citizens within a single generation. We have banned the import of ivory to protect the elephant and rhinoceros from the human predators who exterminate them for profit. And we have begun to explore ways to work with other nations, with the major industrialized democracies, and in Poland and in Hungary, to make common cause for the sake of our environment.",UNGD

USA,1989,"But as always, questions of war and peace must be paramount to the United Nations. We must move forward to limit and eliminate weapons of mass destruction. Five years ago, at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, I presented a United States draft treaty outlawing chemical weapons. Since then, progress has been made, but time is running out. The threat is growing. More than 20 nations now possess chemical weapons or the capability to produce them. And these horrible weapons are now finding their way into regional conflicts. That is simply unacceptable. For the sake of mankind, we must halt and reverse this threat.",UNGD
USA,1989,"Today I want to announce steps that the United States is ready to take, steps to rid the world of these truly terrible weapons, steps towards a treaty that will ban - eliminate - all chemical weapons from the Earth 10 years from the day it is signed. This initiative contains three major elements. First, in the first eight years of a chemical weapons treaty the United States is ready to destroy nearly all - 98 per cent - of our chemical weapons stockpile, provided the Soviet Union joins the ban, and I think it will. Secondly, we are ready to destroy all of our chemical weapons - 100 per cent, every one - within 10 years, once all nations capable of building chemical weapons sign that total-ban treaty. And thirdly, the United States is ready to begin now. We will eliminate more than 80 per cent of our stockpile even as we work to complete a treaty, if the Soviet Union joins us in cutting chemical weapons to an equal level and if we agree on the conditions, including inspections, under which stockpiles are destroyed.",UNGD
USA,1989,"We know that monitoring a total ban on chemical weapons will be a challenge. But the knowledge we have gained from our recent arms control experience and our accelerating research in this area makes me believe that we can achieve the level of verification that gives us confidence to go forward with the ban. The world has lived too long in the shadow of chemical warfare? so let us act together, beginning today, to rid the Earth of this scourge.",UNGD
USA,1989,"We are serious about achieving conventional arms reductions as well.

The Soviet Union removed a number of obstacles to progress on conventional and strategic arms reductions. We reached agreements in principle on issues from verification to nuclear testing. And, of course, we agreed to a summit in the spring or early summer of 1990. I look forward to meeting Mr. Gorbachev there.",UNGD
USA,1989,"Each of those achievements is important in its own right, but they are more important still as signs of a new attitude that prevails between the United States and the USSR. Serious differences remain; we know that. But the willingness to deal constructively and candidly with those differences is news that we and indeed the world must welcome. We have not entered into an era of perpetual peace. The threats to peace that nations face may today be changing, but they have not vanished. In fact, in a number of regions around the world, a dangerous combination is now emerging: regimes armed with old and unappeasable animosities and modern weapons of mass destruction. That development will raise the stakes whenever war breaks out. Regional conflict may well threaten world peace as never before.",UNGD
USA,1989,"The challenge of preserving peace is a personal one for all individuals right here in this Hall. Mr. Secretary-General, I say with great respect that you have made it your own. The United Nations can be a mediator, a forum where parties in conflict come in search of peaceful solutions. For the sake of peace, the United Nations must redouble its support for the peace efforts now under way in regions of conflict all over the world. I assure the Assembly that the United States is determined to take an active role in settling regional conflicts. Sometimes our role in regional disputes is and will be highly public, and sometimes, like many others do, we work quietly behind the scenes. But always, we are working for positive change and lasting peace.",UNGD
USA,1989,"Our world faces other, less conventional threats no less dangerous to international peace and stability. Illegal drugs are a menace to social order and a source of human misery wherever they gain a foothold. The nations which suffer this scourge must join forces in the fight, and we are. Let me salute the commitment and extraordinary courage of one country in particular: Colombia, where",UNGD
USA,1989,"we are working with the people and their President, Virgil lo Barco, to put the drug cartels cut of business and bring the drug lords to justice.",UNGD
USA,1989,"Finally, we must join forces to combat the threat of terrorism. Every nation and the United Nations must send the outlaws of the world a clear message hostage-taking and the terror of random violence are methods that cannot win the world's approval. Terrorism of any kind is repugnant to all values that a civilized world holds in common. And make no mistake.- Terrorism is a means that no end, no matter how just, can sanctify.",UNGD
USA,1989,"Whatever the challenge, freedom greatly raises the chances of our success. Freedom's moment is a time for hope for all of the world, because freedom, once set in motion, takes on a momentum of its own. As I said the day I assumed the presidency of our country, we do not have to talk late into the night about which form of government is better. We know that free government, democracy, is best. And I believe that is the hard-won truth of our time, the unassailable fact that still stands at the end of a century of great struggle and human suffering. And this is true not because all our differences must give way to democracy , but because democracy makes room for all our differences. In democracy, diversity finds its common home.",UNGD
USA,1989,"At the very heart of the democratic ideal is respect for freedom of belief, freedom of thought and action, in all its diversity, for human rights. The world has experienced enough of the ideologies that have promised to remake man in some new and better image. We have seen the colossal tragedies and dashed hopes. We know now that freedom and democracy hold the answers: what men and nations want is the freedom to live by their own lights and a chance to prosper, in peace.",UNGD
USA,1989,"When I began today I spoke to you about peace-keeping. I want to speak to you now about peace-making. We must bring peace to the people who have never known its blessings. There is a painting that hangs on the wall of my office in the White House which pictures President Abraham Lincoln and his generals meeting near the end of a war that remains the bloodiest in the history of my country. Outside at that moment a battle rages, in this picture, and yet what we see in the distance is a rainbow, a symbol of hope, of the passing of the storm. That painting is called ""The Peace-makers"". For me, it is a constant reminder that our struggle, the struggle for peace, is a struggle blessed by hope.",UNGD
USA,1989,"I do remember sitting in this Hall, I remember the mutual respect among all of us proudly serving as representatives, yes, I remember the almost endless speeches - and I do not want this to be one of them - the Security Council sessions, the receptions, those long receiving lines, the formal meetings of the General Assembly, and the informal discussions in the delegates' lounge. And I remember something more, something beyond the frantic pace and sometimes frustrating experiences of daily life here: The heartbeat of the United Nations, the quiet conviction that we could make the world more peaceful, more free. What we sought then, all of us, now lies within our reach. I ask each of you here in this Hall:",UNGD
USA,1989,"Can we not bring a unity of purpose to the United Nations? Can we not make this new world of freedom the common destiny we seek? I believe we can. I know we must. My solemn wish today is that here, among the United Nations, that spirit will take hold, and that all men and all nations will make freedom's moment their own.",UNGD

USA,1990,"It is really a great privilege to greet you today as we begin what marks a new and historic session of the General Assembly. My congratulations to the Honourable Guido de Marco on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly. On a personal note I want to say that, having witnessed the unprecedented unity and co-operation of the past two months, I have never been prouder to have once served within your ranks and never been prouder that the United States is the host country for the United Nations.",UNGD
USA,1990,"Forty-five years ago, while the fires of an epic war still raged across two oceans and two continents, a small group of men and women began a search for hope amid the ruins and they gathered in San Francisco, stepping back from the haze and horror to try to shape a new structure that might support an ancient dream.",UNGD
USA,1990,"Intensely idealistic, and yet tempered by war, they sought to build a new kind of bridge, a bridge between nations, a bridge that might help carry humankind from its darkest hour to its brightest day.",UNGD
USA,1990,The founding of the United Nations embodied our deepest hopes for a peaceful world. And during the past year we have come closer than ever before to realizing those hopes. We have seen a century sundered by barbed threats and barbed wire give way to a new era of peace and competition and freedom. ,UNGD
USA,1990,"The revolution of 1989 swept the world almost with a life of its own, carried by a new breeze of freedom that transformed the political climate from Central Europe to Central America, and touched almost every corner of the globe. That breeze has been sustained by a now almost-universal recognition of a simple, fundamental truth: the human spirit cannot be locked up forever. The truth is that people everywhere are motivated in much the same way and people everywhere want much the same thing: the chance to live a life of purpose, the chance to choose s life in which they and their children can learn and grow healthy, worship freely, and prosper through the work of their hands and their hearts and their minds. We are not talking about the power of nations, but the power of individuals: the power to choose, the power to risk, the power to succeed.",UNGD
USA,1990,This is a new and different world. Not since 1945 have we seen the real possibility of using the United Nations as it was designed - as a centre for international collective security.,UNGD
USA,1990,"The changes in the Soviet Union have been critical to the emergence of a stronger United Nations. The United States-Soviet relationship is finally beyond containment and confrontation, and now we seek to fulfil the promise of mutually shared understanding.",UNGD
USA,1990,"The long twilight struggle that for 45 years has divided Europe, our two nations and much of the world has come to an end. Much has changed over the last two years. The Soviet Union has taken many dramatic and important steps to participate fully in the community of nations, and when the Soviet Union agreed with so many of us here in the United Nations to condemn the aggression of Iraq, there could be no doubt that we had indeed put four decades of history behind us. ",UNGD
USA,1990,We are hopeful that the machinery of the United Nations will no longer he frozen by the divisions that plagued us during the cold war; that at long last we can build new bridges and tear down old walls; that at long last we will be able to build a new world based on an event for which we have all hoped - an end to the cold war.,UNGD
USA,1990,"Two days from now the world will be watching when the cold war is formally buried in Berlin. And in this time of testing a fundamental question must be asked a question not for any one nation, but for the United Nations. And the question is this: Can we work together in a new partnership of nations? Can the collective strength of the world community, expressed by the United Nations, unite to deter and defeat aggression? Because the cold war's battle of ideas is not the last epic battle of this century. ",UNGD
USA,1990,"Two months ago, in the waning weeks of one of history's most hopeful summers, the vast, still beauty of the peaceful Kuwaiti desert was fouled by the stench of diesel and the roar of steel tanks. Once again the sound of distant thunder echoed across a cloudless sky. And once again the world awoke to face the guns of August.",UNGD
USA,1990,But this time the world was ready. The United Nations Security Council's resolute response to Iraq's unprovoked aggression has been without precedent. Since the invasion on 2 August the Council has adopted eight major resolutions setting the terms for a solution to the crisis.,UNGD
USA,1990,"The Iraqi regime has yet to face the facts. But as I said last month: The annexation of Kuwait will not be permitted to stand. This is not simply the view of the United States. It is the view of every Kuwaiti, the Arab League and the United Nations. Iraq's leaders should listen: it is Iraq against the world. Let me take this opportunity to make the policy of my Government clear. The United States supports the use of sanctions to compel Iraq's leaders to withdraw immediately and without condition from Kuwait. We also support the provision of medicine and food for humanitarian purposes, so long as distribution can be properly monitored. Our quarrel is not with the people of Iraq. We do not wish for them to suffer. The world's quarrel is with the dictator who ordered that invasion.",UNGD
USA,1990,"Along with others, we have dispatched military forces to the region to enforce sanctions, to deter and if need be defend against further aggression. We seek no advantage for ourselves. Nor do we seek to maintain our military forces in Saudi Arabia for one day longer than is necessary. The United States forces were sent at the request of the Saudi Government. The American people - and this President - want every single American soldier brought home as soon as this mission is completed. ",UNGD
USA,1990,"Let me also emphasise that all of us here at the United Nations hope that military force will never be used. We seek a peaceful outcome - a diplomatic outcome. And one more thing - in the aftermath of Iraq's unconditional departure from Kuwait, I truly believe there may be opportunities: for Iraq and Kuwait to settle their differences permanently; for the States of the Gulf themselves to build new arrangements for stability; and for all the States and peoples of the region to settle the conflict that divides the Arabs from Israel. But the world's key task - now, first and always - must be to demonstrate that aggression will not be tolerated or rewarded.",UNGD
USA,1990,"Through the United Nations Security Council, Iraq has been judged - fairly judged - by a jury of its peers, the very nations of the Earth. Today the regime stands isolated and out of step with the times, separated from the civilized world not by space but by centuries. Iraq's unprovoked aggression is a throw-back to another era, a dark relic from a dark time. It has plundered Kuwait; it has terrorised innocent civilians; it has held even diplomats hostage. Iraq and its leaders must be held liable for these crimes of abuse and destruction. But this outrageous disregard for basic human rights does not come as a total surprise. Thousands of Iraqis have been executed on political and religious grounds, and even more through a genocidal, poison-gas war waged against Iraq's own Kurdish villagers.",UNGD
USA,1990,"As a world community, we must act - not only to deter the use of inhumane weapons like mustard and nerve gas, but to eliminate the weapons entirely. That is why one year ago I came to the General Assembly with new proposals to banish these terrible weapons from the face of the Earth. I promised that the United States would destroy over 88 per cent of its stockpile in the first eight years of a chemical weapons ban treaty, and 100 per cent - all of them - in 10 years, if all nations with chemical weapons capabilities signed the treaty. ",UNGD
USA,1990,We have stood by those promises. In June the United States and the Soviet Union signed a landmark agreement to halt production and destroy the vast majority of our stockpiles. Today United States chemical weapons are being destroyed.,UNGD
USA,1990,"But time is running out. This is not merely a bilateral concern. The Gulf crisis proves how important it is to act together - and to act now - to conclude an absolute, world-wide ban on these weapons. We must also redouble our efforts to stem the spread of nuclear weapons, biological weapons and the ballistic missiles that can rain destruction upon distant peoples.",UNGD
USA,1990,"The United Nations can help bring about a new day, a day when these kinds of terrible weapons and the terrible despots who would use them are both a thing o£ the past. It is in our hands to leave these dark machines behind, in the dark ages where they belong, and to press forward to cap a historic movement towards a new world order and a long era of peace.",UNGD
USA,1990,"We have a vision of a new partnership of nations that transcends the cold war - a partnership based on consultation, co-operation and collective action, especially through international and regional organizations; a partnership united by principle and the rule of law, and supported by an equitable sharing of both cost and commitment; a partnership whose goals are to increase democracy, increase prosperity, increase the peace, and reduce arms.",UNGD
USA,1990,"And as we look to the future the calendar offers up a convenient milestone, a signpost by which to measure our progress as a community of nations. The year 2000 marks a turning-point, beginning not only the turn of the decade, not only the turn of the century, but also the turn of the millennium. And 10 years from now, as the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly begins, you will again find many of us in this Hall, our hair a bit more grey, perhaps, and a little less spring in our walk. But you will not find us with any less hope or idealism, or any less confidence in the ultimate triumph of mankind. I see a world of open borders, open trade, and - most importantly - open minds; a world that celebrates the common heritage that belongs to all the world9s people, taking pride not just in hometown or homeland, but in humanity itself. I see a world touched by a spirit like that of the Olympics: based not on competition that is driven by fear, but sought out of joy and exhilaration and a true quest for excellence. ",UNGD
USA,1990,"I see a world where democracy continues to win new friends and convert old foes, and where the Americas, North, Central and South, can provide a model for the future of all humankind - the world's first completely democratic hemisphere.",UNGD
USA,1990,"And I see a world building on the emerging new model of European unity; not just Europe, but the whole world - whole and free. This is precisely why the present aggression in the Gulf is a menace not only to one region's security but to the entire world's vision of our future. It threatens to turn the dream of a new international order into a grim nightmare of anarchy, in which the law of the jungle supplants the law of nations.",UNGD
USA,1990,"That is why the United Nations reacted with such historic unity and resolve. And that is why this challenge is a test that we cannot afford to fail. I am confident that we will prevail. Success, too, will have lasting consequences - reinforcing civilized standards of international conduct, setting a new precedent in international co-operation, brightening the prospects for our vision of the future.",UNGD
USA,1990,"There are 10 more years until the century is out - 10 more years to put the struggles of the twentieth century permanently behind us; 10 more years to help to launch a new partnership of nations. Throughout those 10 years - and beginning now - the United Nations has a new and vital role in building towards that partnership. Last year's session of the General Assembly showed how we can make greater progress towards a more pragmatic and successful United Nations. And, for the first time, the Security Council is beginning to work as it was designed to work.",UNGD
USA,1990,"Now is the time to set aside old and counter-productive debates, procedures, controversies and resolutions. It is time to replace polemic attacks with pragmatic action. ",UNGD
USA,1990,"We have shown that the United Nations can count on the collective strength of the international community. We have shown that the United Nations can rise to the challenge of aggression, just as its founders hoped it would. How, in this time of testing, we must also show that the United Nations is the place to build international support and consensus for meeting the other challenges that we face.",UNGD
USA,1990,"The world remains a dangerous place. Our security and well-being often depend, in part, on events occurring far away. We need serious international co-operative efforts to make headway on threats to the environment, on terrorism, on management of the debt burden, on the fight against the scourge of international drug trafficking, and on refugees and peace-keeping efforts around the world.",UNGD
USA,1990,"But the world also remains a hopeful place. Calls for democracy and human rights are being reborn everywhere. These calls are an expression of support for the values enshrined in the United Nations Charter. They encourage our hopes for a more stable, more peaceful, more prosperous world.",UNGD
USA,1990,"Free elections are the foundation of democratic government, and can produce dramatic successes, as we have seen in Namibia and Nicaragua. The time has come to structure the role of the United Nations in such efforts more formally. So, today, I propose that the United Nations establish a special co-ordinator for electoral assistance, to be assisted by a United Nations electoral commission comprising distinguished experts from around the world.",UNGD
USA,1990,"As with free elections, we believe that universal United Nations membership - membership for all States - is central to the future of the Organization and to the new partnership that we have discussed. In support of this principle, and in conjunction with United Nations efforts to reduce regional tensions, the United States fully supports United Nations membership for the Republic of Korea. We do so without prejudice to the ultimate objective of reunification of the Korean Peninsula, and without opposition to simultaneous membership for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.",UNGD
USA,1990,"Building on these and other initiatives, we must join together in a new compact - all of us - to bring the United Nations into the twenty-first century. I call today for a major, long-term effort to do this. We should build on the success, the admirable success, of our distinguished Secretary-General - my long-time friend and colleague, and yours - Javier Perez de Cuellar. We should strive to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the United Nations.",UNGD
USA,1990,"The United States is committed to playing its part - helping to maintain global security, promoting democracy and prosperity. My Administration is fully committed to supporting the United Nations, and to paying what we are obliged to pay by our commitment to the Charter. International peace and security - and international freedom and prosperity - require no less. ",UNGD
USA,1990,"The world must know and understand that from this hour, from this day, from this Hall, we step forth with a new sense of purpose, a new sense of possibilities. We are united, prepared to swim upstream, to march uphill, to tackle the tough challenges as they come - not only as the United Nations, but as the nations of the world united.",UNGD
USA,1990,"Let it be said of the final decade of the twentieth century that this was a time when humankind came into its own, when we emerged from the grit and the smoke of the industrial age to bring about a revolution of the spirit and of the mind, and began a journey into a new day, a new age, and a new partnership of nations.",UNGD
USA,1990,"The United Nations is now fulfilling its promise as the world's parliament of peace. I congratulate you, I support you, and I wish you Godspeed in the challenges ahead. ",UNGD
USA,1991,"I am honoured to speak with you as you open the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. I should first like to congratulate the outgoing President, Guido de Marco of Malta, and salute our incoming President, Samir Al-Shihabi of Saudi Arabia.",UNGD
USA,1991,"I also want to salute especially Secretary-General Javier Peres de Cuellar, who will step down in just over three months. But let me say, Secretary-General Peres de Cuellar has served with great distinction during a period of unprecedented change and turmoil, and for almost 10 years we have enjoyed the leadership of this man of peace, a man that I, along with many Members, feel proud to call friend, and so today let us congratulate our friend and praise his spectacular service to the United Nations and to the people of the world, the Secretary-General.",UNGD
USA,1991,"Let me also welcome new Members in this Hall, two delegations representing Korea, particularly our democratic friends, the Republic of Korea, the Republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and new missions from the Marshall Islands and Micronesia. Twenty years ago, when I was the Permanent Representative here for the United States, there were 132 United Nations Members. Just one week ago, 159 nations enjoyed membership in the United Nations, and today the number stands at 166. The presence of these new Members alone provides reason for us to celebrate. ",UNGD
USA,1991,"My statement today will not sound like any you have heard from a President of the United States. I am not going to dwell on the super-Power competition that defined international politics for half a century. Instead, I will discuss the challenges of building peace and prosperity in a world leavened by the cold war's end and the resumption of history.",UNGD
USA,1991,"Communism held history captive for years. It suspended ancient disputes; and it suppressed ethnic rivalries, nationalist aspirations and old prejudices. As it has dissolved, suspended hatreds have sprung to life. People who for years have been denied their pasts, have begun searching for their own identities, often through peaceful and constructive means, occasionally through factionalism and bloodshed.",UNGD
USA,1991,"This revival of history ushers in a new era teeming with opportunities and perils. Let us begin by discussing the opportunities. First, history's renewal enables people to pursue their natural instincts for enterprise. Communism froze that progress until its failures became too much for even its defenders to bear, and now citizens throughout the world have chosen enterprise over envy, personal responsibility over the enticements of the State, prosperity over the poverty of central planning.",UNGD
USA,1991,"The United Nations Charter encourages this adventure by pledging to employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples, and I can think of no better way to fulfil this Mission than to promote the free flow of goods and Ideas, frankly, ideas and goods will travel around the globe with or without our help. The information revolution has destroyed the weapons of enforced isolation and ignorance. In many parts of the world technology has overwhelmed tyranny, proving that the age of Information can become the age of liberation, if we limit State power wisely and free our people to make the best use of new ideas, inventions and insights. By the same token, the world has learned that free markets provide levels of prosperity, growth and happiness that centrally planned economies can never offer.",UNGD
USA,1991,"Even the most charitable estimates indicate that in recent years the free world's economies have grown at twice the rate of the former communist world. Growth does more than fill shelves; it permits every person to gain, not at the expense of others but to the benefit of others. Prosperity encourages people to live as neighbours, not as predators. Economic growth can aid international relations in exactly the same way.",UNGD
USA,1991,"Many nations represented here are parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The Uruguay Round, the latest in the post-war series of trade negotiations, offers hope to developing nations, many of which have been cruelly divided, cruelly deceived, by the false promises of totalitarianism. Here in this Hall, we hear about North-South problems. But free and open trade, including unfettered access to markets and credit, offers developing countries means of self-sufficiency and economic dignity.",UNGD
USA,1991,"If the Uruguay Round should fail, a new wave of protectionism could destroy our hopes for a better future. History shows all too clearly that protectionism can destroy wealth within countries and poison relations between them. Therefore, I call upon all members of GATT to redouble their efforts to reach a successful conclusion for the Uruguay Round. I pledge that the United States will do its part.",UNGD
USA,1991,"I cannot stress this enough: Economic progress will play a vital role In the new world. It supplies the soil in which democracy grows best. People everywhere seek government of and by the people, and they want to enjoy their inalienable rights to freedom and property and person. Challenges to democracy have failed. Just last month, coup plotters in the Soviet Union tried to derail the forces of liberty and reform, but Soviet citizens refused to follow. Most of the nations in this Hall stood with the forces of reform led by Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin, and against the coup plotters.",UNGD
USA,1991,"The challenge facing the Soviet peoples now, that of building political systems based upon individual liberty, minority rights, democracy and free markets, mirrors every nation's responsibility for encouraging peaceful, democratic reform, but it also testifies to the extraordinary power of the democratic ideal. As democracy flourishes, so does the opportunity (or a third historical breakthrough, international cooperation. A year ago, the Soviet Union joined the United States and a host of other nations in defending a tiny country against aggression and opposing Saddam Hussein. For the very first time on a matter of major importance super-Power competition was replaced with international cooperation. The United Nations, in one of its finest moments, constructed a measured, principled, deliberate and courageous response to Saddam Hussein. It stood up to an outlaw who invaded Kuwait, who threatened many States within the region, who sought to set a menacing precedent for the post-cold-war world.",UNGD
USA,1991,"The coalition effort established a model for the collective settlement of disputes. Members sat the goal - the liberation of Kuwait - and devised a courageous, unified means of achieving that goal. Mow, for the first time, we have a real chance to fulfil the United Nations Charter's ambition of working ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war ... to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small ... to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom"". Those are the words of the Charter.",UNGD
USA,1991,"He will not revive these ideals if we fail to acknowledge the challenge that the renewal of history presents. In Europe and Asia, nationalist passions have flared anew, challenging borders, straining the fabric of international society. At the same time, around the world many age-old conflicts still fester. We see signs of this tumult right here. The United Nations has mounted more peace-keeping missions in the last 36 months than during its first 43 years, and although we now seem mercifully liberated from the fear of nuclear holocaust, these smaller, virulent conflicts should trouble us all.",UNGD
USA,1991,"We must face this challenge squarely - first, by pursuing the peaceful resolution of disputes now in progress; secondly, and more importantly, by trying to prevent others from erupting. No one hare can promise that today's borders will remain fixed for all time, but we must strive to ensure the peaceful, negotiated settlement of border disputes.",UNGD
USA,1991,"We must also promote the cause of international harmony by addressing old feuds. We should take seriously the Charter's pledge to practise tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbours. United Nations General Assembly resolution 3379 (XXX), the so-called ""Zionism is racism"" resolution, mocks this pledge and the principles upon which the United Nations was founded, and I call now for its repeal. Zionism is not a policy; it is the idea that led to the creation of a home for the Jewish people, to the State of Israel, and to equate Zionism with the intolerable sin of racism is to twist history and forget the terrible plight of Jews in the Second World War - and indeed throughout history. To equate Zionism with racism is to reject Israel itself, a Member in good standing of the United Nations. This body cannot claim to seek peace and at the same time challenge Israel's right to exist. By repealing this resolution unconditionally the United Nations will enhance its credibility and serve the cause of peace.",UNGD
USA,1991,"As we work to meet the challenge posed by the resumption of history, we also must defend the Charter's emphasis on inalienable human rights. Government has failed if citizens cannot speak their mind, if they cannot form political parties freely and elect governments without coercion, it they cannot practice their religion freely, if they cannot raise their families in peace, if they cannot enjoy a just return from their labour, if they cannot live fruitful lives and at the end of their days look upon their achievements and their society's, progress with pride. Politicians who talk about democracy and freedom but provide neither eventually will feel the sting of public disapproval and the power of peoples yearning to live free.",UNGD
USA,1991,"Some nations still deny their basic rights to the people, and too many voices cry out for freedom. For example, the people of Cuba suffer oppression at the hands of a dictator who has not got the word, the lone hold-out in an otherwise democratic hemisphere, a man who has not adapted to a world that has no use for totalitarian tyranny. Elsewhere, despots ignore the heartening fact that the rest of the world is embarked upon a new age of liberty.",UNGD
USA,1991,The renewal of history also imposes an obligation to remain vigilant about new threats and old. He must expand our efforts to control nuclear proliferation. We must work to prevent the spread of chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them.,UNGD
USA,1991,"It is for this reason that I put forward my Middle East arms initiative, a comprehensive approach to stop and, where possible, reverse the accumulation of arms in that part of the world moat prone to violence. We must remember that self-interest will tug nations in different directions, and that struggles over perceived interests will flare sometimes into violence. We can never say with confidence where the next conflict may arise. And we cannot promise eternal peace - not while demagogue peddle false promises to people hungry with hope; not while terrorists use our citizens as pawns and drug dealers destroy our peoples. He, as a result, must band together to overwhelm affronts to basic human dignity. It is no longer acceptable to shrug and say that one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter. Let us put the law above the crude and cowardly practice of hostage-holding.",UNGD
USA,1991,"In a world defined by change, we must be as firm in principle as we are flexible in our response to changing international conditions. That is especially true today of Iraq. Six months after the adoption of Security Council resolutions 687 (1991) and 688 (1991), Saddam continues to rebuild his weapons of mass destruction and to subject the Iraqi people to brutal repression. Saddam's contempt for United Nations resolutions was first demonstrated back in August 1990, and it continues even as I am speaking. His Government refuses to permit unconditional helicopter inspections, and right now is refusing to allow United Nations inspectors to leave inspected premises with documents relating to an Iraqi nuclear weapons programme. It is the view of the United States that we must keep the United Nations sanctions in place as long as he remains in power. This also shows that we cannot compromise for a moment in seeing that Iraq destroys all of its weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them. And we will not compromise.",UNGD
USA,1991,"This is not to say - let me be clear on this point - that we should punish the Iraqi people. Let me repeat: our argument has never been with the people of Iraq. It was, and is, with a brutal dictator whose arrogance dishonours the Iraqi people. Security Council resolution 706 (1991) created a responsible mechanism for sending humanitarian relief to innocent Iraqi citizens. He must put that mechanism to work. Ma must not abandon our principled stand against Saddam's aggression. This cooperative effort has liberated Kuwait. Now it can lead to a just government in Iraq. And when it does - when it does - the Iraqi people can look forward to better lives, free at home, free to engage in a world beyond their borders.",UNGD
USA,1991,"The resumption of history also permits the United Nations to resume the important business of promoting the values that I have discussed today. This body can serve as a vehicle through which willing parties can settle old disputes. In the months to come, I look forward to working with Secretary-General Peres de Cuellar and his successor as we pursue peace in such diverse and divided lands as Afghanistan, Cambodia, Cyprus, El Salvador, and Western Sahara. The United Nations can encourage free market development through its international lending and aid institutions. However, it should not dictate the particular forms of government that nations should adopt. It can, and should, encourage the values upon which the Organization was founded. Together, we should insist that nations seeking our acceptance meet standards of human decency.",UNGD
USA,1991,"Where institutions of freedom have lain dormant, the United Nations can offer them new life. These institutions play a crucial role in our quest for a new world order, an order in which no nation must surrender one iota of its own sovereignty, an order characterized by the rule of law rather than the resort to force, the cooperative development of disputes rather than anarchy and bloodshed, and an unstinting belief in human rights.",UNGD
USA,1991,"Finally, you may wonder about America's role the new world I have described. Let me assure you, the United States has no intention of striving for a pax americana. However, we will remain engaged. We will not retreat and pull back into isolationism. We will offer friendship and leadership. In short, we seek a pax universalis, built upon shared responsibilities and aspirations.",UNGD
USA,1991,"To all assembled: We have an opportunity to spare our sons and daughters the sins and errors of the past. We can build a future more satisfying than any our world has ever known. The future lies undefined before us, full of promise, littered with peril. We can choose the kind of world we want: one blistered by the fires of war and subjected to the winds of coercion and chance, or one made more peaceful by reflection and choice. Take this challenge seriously. Inspire future generations to praise and venerate you, to say, ""On the ruins of conflict, these brave men and women built an era of peace and understanding. They inaugurated a new world order, an order worth preserving for the ages.""",UNGD

USA,1992,"Forty-seven years ago I was a young man of 21, and, ",UNGD
USA,1992,"like thousands of others of my generation, I had gone off to war to help keep ",UNGD
USA,1992,"freedom alive. Forty-seven years ago this month the war was finally over, and ",UNGD
USA,1992,I was looking forward to peace and the chance to begin my life in earnest: ,UNGD
USA,1992,"1945 marked a moment of promise, not just for me, but for all of mankind. A ",UNGD
USA,1992,great struggle against dictatorship had been fought and won. Across the ,UNGD
USA,1992,"globe, we all looked forward to a future free of war, a world where we might ",UNGD
USA,1992,"raise our children in peace and freedom, and this institution, the United ",UNGD
USA,1992,"Nations, born amidst the ashes of war, embodied those hopes and dreams like no ",UNGD
USA,1992,other. ,UNGD
USA,1992,But the hopes and dreams of 1945 remained unfulfilled: communist ,UNGD
USA,1992,"imperialism divided the world in two, our hopes for peace and our dreams of ",UNGD
USA,1992,"freedom were frozen in the grip of cold war, and, instead of finding a common ",UNGD
USA,1992,"ground, we found ourselves at Ground Zero. Instead of living on Churchill's ",UNGD
USA,1992,The President returned to the Chair. ,UNGD
USA,1992,,UNGD
USA,1992,"""broad, sunlit uplands"", millions found that there was, as Arthur Koestler so ",UNGD
USA,1992,"chillingly wrote, ""Darkness at Noon"". Instead of uniting the nations, this ",UNGD
USA,1992,"body became a forum for distrust and division among nations and, in a cruel ",UNGD
USA,1992,"irony, the United Nations, created to free the world of conflict, itself ",UNGD
USA,1992,became conflict's captive. ,UNGD
USA,1992,"I too lived through those disputes; I sat where you sit, proudly so; I ",UNGD
USA,1992,"served in this Assembly and I saw, in my time, the consequences of the cold ",UNGD
USA,1992,"war's hot words on the higher missions of the United Nations. Now, 47 years ",UNGD
USA,1992,"later, we stand at the end of another war, the cold war, and our hopes and ",UNGD
USA,1992,dreams have awakened again. Driven by its own internal contradictions and ,UNGD
USA,1992,"banished by the peoples' undying thirst for freedom, imperial communism has ",UNGD
USA,1992,"collapsed in its birthplace, and today Russia has awakened democratic, ",UNGD
USA,1992,"independent and free; the Baltic States are free; and so too are Ukraine, ",UNGD
USA,1992,"Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and the other independent States joining the ",UNGD
USA,1992,nations of Central and Eastern Europe in freedom. ,UNGD
USA,1992,"The fear of nuclear Armageddon between the super-Powers has vanished, and ",UNGD

USA,1992,"With the cold war's end, I believe we have a unique opportunity to go ",UNGD
USA,1992,"beyond artificial divisions of a first, second and third world to forge ",UNGD

USA,1992,"built on respect for principle, on peaceful settlement of disputes, on ",UNGD
USA,1992,fundamental human rights and on the twin pillars of freedom: democracy and ,UNGD

USA,1992,community. ,UNGD
USA,1992,United Nations leadership has been critical in resolving conflicts and ,UNGD
USA,1992,"brokering peace the entire world over, but securing democracy and securing the ",UNGD
USA,1992,peace in the century ahead will be no simple task. Imperial communism may ,UNGD
USA,1992,"have been vanquished, but that does not end the challenges of our age, ",UNGD
USA,1992,challenges that must be overcome if we are finally to end the divisions ,UNGD
USA,1992,"between East and West, North and South, that fuel strife and strain and ",UNGD
USA,1992,conflict and war. ,UNGD
USA,1992,"As we support the historic growth of democracy around the world, I ",UNGD
USA,1992,"believe the community of nations and the United Nations face three critical, ",UNGD
USA,1992,interrelated challenges as we enter the twenty-first century. ,UNGD
USA,1992,"First, we face the political challenge of keeping today's peace and ",UNGD
USA,1992,"preventing tomorrow's wars. As we see daily in Bosnia, Somalia and Cambodia, ",UNGD
USA,1992,everywhere conflict claims innocent lives; the need for enhanced peace-keeping ,UNGD
USA,1992,capabilities has never been greater; the conflicts we must deal with have ,UNGD
USA,1992,"never been more intractable, the costs of conflict higher. ",UNGD
USA,1992,"Second, we face the strategic challenge of the proliferation of weapons ",UNGD
USA,1992,"of mass destruction, truly the fastest growing security challenge to ",UNGD
USA,1992,international peace and order. ,UNGD
USA,1992,,UNGD
USA,1992,"Third, we face the common economic challenge of promoting prosperity for ",UNGD
USA,1992,"all, of strengthening an open, growth-oriented, free-market international ",UNGD
USA,1992,economic order while safeguarding the environment. ,UNGD
USA,1992,Meeting these challenges will require us to strengthen our collective ,UNGD
USA,1992,"engagement; it will require us to transform our collective institutions; and, ",UNGD
USA,1992,"above all, it will require that each of us look seriously at our own ",UNGD
USA,1992,Government and how we conduct our international affairs. We too must change ,UNGD
USA,1992,our institutions and our practices if we are to make a new world of the ,UNGD
USA,1992,"promises of today, if we are to secure a twenty-first century peace. ",UNGD
USA,1992, ,UNGD
USA,1992,With you today I would like to discuss these three challenges: ,UNGD
USA,1992,"peace-keeping, proliferation and prosperity. And I should like to use this ",UNGD
USA,1992,opportunity to begin to sketch how I believe the international community can ,UNGD
USA,1992,work together to meet these three challenges and how the United States is ,UNGD
USA,1992,changing its institutions and policies to catalyze this effort. ,UNGD
USA,1992,Let me begin with peace-keeping. The United Nations has a long and ,UNGD
USA,1992,distinguished history of peace-keeping and humanitarian relief. From Cyprus ,UNGD
USA,1992,"and Lebanon, to Cambodia and Croatia, the blue beret has become a symbol of ",UNGD
USA,1992,hope amid all that hostility. And the United Nations has long played a ,UNGD
USA,1992,"central role in preventing conflicts from turning into wars, and strengthening ",UNGD
USA,1992,"peace-keeping capabilities can help buttress these diplomatic efforts. But, ",UNGD
USA,1992,"as much as the United Nations has done, it can do much more. ",UNGD
USA,1992,Peace-keepers are stretched to the limit while the demands for their ,UNGD
USA,1992,services increase by the day. The need for monitoring and preventive ,UNGD
USA,1992,peace-keeping putting people on the ground before the fighting starts - may ,UNGD
USA,1992,become especially critical in volatile regions. This is especially the case ,UNGD
USA,1992,because of the rapid and turbulent change that continues to shake Eastern ,UNGD
USA,1992,Europe and Eurasia. Across the lands that once were imprisoned behind an iron ,UNGD
USA,1992,"curtain, peoples are reasserting their historical identities that were frozen ",UNGD
USA,1992,in communism's catacomb. ,UNGD
USA,1992,Where this is taking place in a democratic manner with tolerance and ,UNGD
USA,1992,"civility and respect for fundamental human rights and freedoms, this new ",UNGD
USA,1992,"democratic nationalism is all to the good. But, unfortunately, we need only ",UNGD
USA,1992,look to the bloody battles raging in places such as the former Yugoslavia to ,UNGD
USA,1992,see the dangers of ethnic violence. This is the greatest threat to the ,UNGD
USA,1992,"democratic peace we hope to build with Eastern Europe, with Russia and ",UNGD
USA,1992, ,UNGD
USA,1992,"Eurasia, even more than economic deprivation. We fully support the efforts of ",UNGD
USA,1992,"the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the Conference on Security and ",UNGD
USA,1992,"Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), the Western European Union (WEU), the ",UNGD
USA,1992,Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and other competent regional ,UNGD
USA,1992,organizations to develop peace-keeping capabilities. ,UNGD
USA,1992,"We are convinced, however, that enhanced United Nations capabilities are ",UNGD
USA,1992,"a necessary complement to these regional efforts, not just in Europe and ",UNGD
USA,1992,"Eurasia, but across the globe. ",UNGD
USA,1992,I welcome the Secretary-General's call for a new agenda to strengthen the ,UNGD
USA,1992,"ability of the United Nations to prevent, contain and resolve conflicts across ",UNGD
USA,1992,the globe. Today I call upon all Members to join me in taking bold steps to ,UNGD
USA,1992,advance that agenda. I will therefore be discussing with my colleagues the ,UNGD
USA,1992,merits of a special meeting of the Security Council to discuss the ,UNGD
USA,1992,Secretary-General's proposals and to develop concrete responses in five key ,UNGD
USA,1992,areas. ,UNGD
USA,1992,"First, robust peace-keeping requires men and equipment that only Member ",UNGD
USA,1992,States can provide. Nations should develop and train military units for ,UNGD
USA,1992,possible peace-keeping operations and humanitarian relief and these forces ,UNGD
USA,1992,must be available on short notice at the request of the Security Council and ,UNGD
USA,1992,"with the approval, of course, of the Governments providing it. ",UNGD
USA,1992,"Secondly, if multinational units are to work together, they must train ",UNGD
USA,1992,"together. Many nations for example, Fiji, Norway, Canada and Finland have ",UNGD
USA,1992,a long history of peace-keeping and we can all tap into that experience as we ,UNGD
USA,1992,train for expanded operations. Effective multinational action will also ,UNGD
USA,1992,require coordinated command and control and inter-operability of both ,UNGD
USA,1992,"equipment and communications. Multinational planning, training, field ",UNGD
USA,1992,,UNGD
USA,1992,exercises will be needed. Those efforts should link up with regional ,UNGD
USA,1992,organizations. ,UNGD
USA,1992,"Thirdly, we also need to provide adequate logistical support for ",UNGD
USA,1992,peace-keeping and humanitarian operations. Member States should designate ,UNGD
USA,1992,"stockpiles of resources necessary to meet humanitarian emergencies, including ",UNGD
USA,1992,"famines, floods and civil disturbances. This will save valuable time in a ",UNGD
USA,1992,crisis. ,UNGD
USA,1992,"Fourthly, we will need to develop planning, crisis management and ",UNGD
USA,1992,intelligence capabilities for peace-keeping and humanitarian operations. ,UNGD
USA,1992,"Fifthly, we must ensure adequate equitable financing for United Nations ",UNGD
USA,1992,and associated peace-keeping efforts. ,UNGD
USA,1992,"As I said, we must change our national institutions if we are to change ",UNGD
USA,1992,our international relations. So let me assure you that the United States is ,UNGD
USA,1992,ready to do its part to strengthen world peace by strengthening international ,UNGD
USA,1992,peace-keeping. ,UNGD
USA,1992,"For decades, the American military has served as a stabilizing presence ",UNGD
USA,1992,around the globe. And I want to draw on our extensive experience in winning ,UNGD
USA,1992,"wars, in keeping the peace, to support United Nations peace-keeping. I have ",UNGD
USA,1992,directed the United States Secretary of Defense to place a new emphasis on ,UNGD
USA,1992,peace-keeping. Because of peace-keeping's growing importance as a mission for ,UNGD
USA,1992,"the United States military, we will emphasize training of combat, engineering ",UNGD
USA,1992,and logistical units for the full range of peace-keeping and humanitarian ,UNGD
USA,1992,activities and we will work with the United Nations to best employ our ,UNGD
USA,1992,"considerable lift, logistics, communications and intelligence capabilities to ",UNGD
USA,1992,support peace-keeping operations. And we will offer our capabilities for ,UNGD
USA,1992,joint simulations and exercises to strengthen our ability to undertake joint ,UNGD
USA,1992,peace-keeping operations. ,UNGD
USA,1992,,UNGD
USA,1992,"There is room for all countries, large and small, and I hope all will ",UNGD
USA,1992,play a part. ,UNGD
USA,1992,"Member States, as always, must retain the final decision on the use of ",UNGD
USA,1992,"their troops, of course. But we must develop our ability to coordinate ",UNGD
USA,1992,peace-keeping efforts so that we can mobilize quickly when a threat to peace ,UNGD
USA,1992,arises or when people in need look to the world for help. ,UNGD
USA,1992,I have further directed the establishment of a permanent peace-keeping ,UNGD
USA,1992,"curriculum in United States military schools. Training, plainly, is a key ",UNGD
USA,1992,element. The United States is prepared to make available our bases and ,UNGD
USA,1992,"facilities for multinational training and field exercises. One such base, ",UNGD
USA,1992,"nearby, with facilities is Fort Dix. America used these bases to win the cold ",UNGD
USA,1992,"war and today, with that war over, they can help build a lasting peace. ",UNGD
USA,1992,The United States is willing to provide our military expertise to the ,UNGD
USA,1992,United Nations to help the United Nations strengthen its planning and ,UNGD
USA,1992,"operations for peace-keeping, and we will also broaden American support for ",UNGD
USA,1992,"monitoring, verification, reconnaissance and other requirements of United ",UNGD
USA,1992,Nations peace-keeping or humanitarian assistance operations. ,UNGD
USA,1992,"And, finally, the United States will review how we fund peace-keeping and ",UNGD
USA,1992,explore new ways to ensure adequate American financial support for United ,UNGD
USA,1992,Nations peace-keeping and United Nations humanitarian activities. I do ,UNGD
USA,1992,believe that we must think differently about how we ensure and pay for our ,UNGD
USA,1992,security in this new era. ,UNGD
USA,1992,"While the cold war may have ended, the super-Power nuclear arms ",UNGD
USA,1992,"competition, regional competition, weapons of mass destruction continue. Over ",UNGD
USA,1992,"20 countries have, or are developing, nuclear, chemical or biological weapons ",UNGD
USA,1992, ,UNGD
USA,1992,and the means to deliver them. At a time when the United States and its ,UNGD
USA,1992,"former adversaries are engaged in deep, historic cuts in our nuclear arsenals, ",UNGD
USA,1992,our children and grandchildren will never forgive us if we allow new and ,UNGD
USA,1992,unstable nuclear stand-offs to develop around the world. ,UNGD
USA,1992,,UNGD
USA,1992,We believe the Security Council should become a key forum for ,UNGD
USA,1992,non-proliferation enforcement. The Security Council should make clear its ,UNGD
USA,1992,intention to stem proliferation and sanction proliferators. Reaffirming ,UNGD
USA,1992,assurances made at the time the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear ,UNGD
USA,1992,"Weapons was negotiated, I propose that the Security Council reassure the ",UNGD
USA,1992,"non-nuclear States that it will seek immediate action to provide assistance, ",UNGD
USA,1992,"in accordance with the Charter, to any any non-nuclear-weapon State party to ",UNGD
USA,1992,the non-proliferation Treaty that is a victim of an act of aggression or an ,UNGD
USA,1992,object of threat of aggression involving nuclear weapons. ,UNGD
USA,1992,I also call for the indefinite renewal of the nuclear non-proliferation ,UNGD
USA,1992,Treaty when it is reviewed in 1995. I believe we must explore ways we can ,UNGD
USA,1992,"strengthen linkages between the suppliers ""clubs"", the nuclear-suppliers ",UNGD
USA,1992,"group, the Australia Group, the missile-technology control regime and United ",UNGD
USA,1992,Nations specialized agencies. ,UNGD
USA,1992,Here I would like to note the productive efforts of the United Nations ,UNGD
USA,1992,Special Commission (UNSCOM) to dismantle the Iraqi weapons-of-mass-destruction ,UNGD
USA,1992,"programme, and the continuing good work of the International Atomic Energy ",UNGD
USA,1992,Agency (IAEA). But as the United Nations organizations adapt to stop ,UNGD
USA,1992,"proliferation, so too must every Member State change its structures to advance ",UNGD
USA,1992,our non-proliferation goals. ,UNGD
USA,1992,In that spirit I want today to announce my intention to work with the ,UNGD
USA,1992,United States Congress to redirect the United States Arms Control and ,UNGD
USA,1992,Disarmament Agency (ACDA) to refocus its talents on providing technical ,UNGD
USA,1992,"support for non-proliferation, weapons monitoring and destruction, and global ",UNGD
USA,1992,"defence conversion. Under the direction of the Secretary of State, ACDA ",UNGD
USA,1992,,UNGD
USA,1992,"should be used not only in completing the traditional arms-control agenda but, ",UNGD
USA,1992,"just as importantly, in providing technical assistance on our new security ",UNGD
USA,1992,agenda. ,UNGD
USA,1992,"Even as we work to prevent proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, ",UNGD
USA,1992,we must be realistic and guard ourselves against proliferation that is already ,UNGD
USA,1992,"taking place. Therefore, we are working towards a cooperative system for ",UNGD
USA,1992,defence against limited ballistic missile attacks. We fully intend to have ,UNGD
USA,1992,other nations participate in this global protection system. ,UNGD
USA,1992,While expanded peace-keeping capabilities and improved non-proliferation ,UNGD
USA,1992,"efforts will be critical for building an enduring peace, shared economic ",UNGD
USA,1992,growth is the long-term foundation for a brighter future well into the next ,UNGD
USA,1992,"century. That is why I stated yesterday, during a moment of international ",UNGD
USA,1992,"uncertainty, that the United States would be strongly engaged with its global ",UNGD
USA,1992,"partners in building a global economic, financial and trading structure for ",UNGD
USA,1992,this new era. ,UNGD
USA,1992,"At the same time, I urged that our global responsibilities lead us to ",UNGD
USA,1992,"examine ways to strengthen the Group of Seven (G-7) coordination process, and ",UNGD
USA,1992,I affirmed America's support for a European integration that opens markets and ,UNGD
USA,1992,enhances Europe's capability to be our partner in the great challenges that we ,UNGD
USA,1992,"face in this new era. While the exact form of integration is, of course, for ",UNGD
USA,1992,"Europeans to determine, we will stand by them. ",UNGD
USA,1992,Economic growth is not a zero-sum process. All of us will benefit from ,UNGD
USA,1992,"the expanded trade and investment that comes from a vibrant, growing world ",UNGD
USA,1992,economy. To ensure that the benefits of this growth are sustained and shared ,UNGD
USA,1992,"by all, fair and open competition should be the fuel for the global economic ",UNGD
USA,1992,,UNGD
USA,1992,engine. That is why the United States wants to complete the Uruguay Round of ,UNGD
USA,1992,the negotiations within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) as ,UNGD
USA,1992,"soon as possible, and to create a network of free-trade agreements, beginning ",UNGD
USA,1992,with the North American Free Trade Agreement. ,UNGD
USA,1992,"At the same time, we need to recognize that we have a shared ",UNGD
USA,1992,responsibility to foster and support the free-market reforms necessary to ,UNGD
USA,1992,build growing economies and vibrant democracies in the developing world and in ,UNGD
USA,1992,the new democratic States. This should be done by promoting the private ,UNGD
USA,1992,"sector to build these new economies, not by fostering dependency with ",UNGD
USA,1992,traditional Government-to-Government foreign aid. ,UNGD
USA,1992,"After the Second World War, foreign assistance often served as a weapon ",UNGD
USA,1992,"in the cold war. Obviously, we will still use critical foreign-assistance ",UNGD
USA,1992,"funds to meet legitimate security needs. And, as our humanitarian operations ",UNGD
USA,1992,"in Somalia and northern Iraq, Bosnia and the former Soviet Union will testify, ",UNGD
USA,1992,we will continue our robust humanitarian assistance efforts to help those ,UNGD
USA,1992,suffering from man-made and natural disasters. ,UNGD
USA,1992,But foreign aid as we have known it needs to be transformed. The notion ,UNGD
USA,1992,of the handout to less developed countries needs to give way to cooperation ,UNGD
USA,1992,and mutually productive economic relationships. We know this: the more a ,UNGD
USA,1992,"nation relies on the private sector and free markets, the higher its rate of ",UNGD
USA,1992,"growth; the more open to trade it is, the higher its rate of growth; and the ",UNGD
USA,1992,"better a country's investment climate, the higher its rate of growth. ",UNGD
USA,1992,"To move from what I would call aid-dependency to economic partnership, we ",UNGD
USA,1992,propose to alter fundamentally the focus of United States assistance ,UNGD
USA,1992,"programmes to building strong, independent economies that can become ",UNGD
USA,1992,,UNGD
USA,1992,"contributors to a healthy, growing global economy. That means that our new ",UNGD
USA,1992,emphasis should be on building economic partnerships among our private sectors ,UNGD
USA,1992,"that will promote prosperity at home, and abroad also. Working with our ",UNGD
USA,1992,Congress I will propose a top-to-bottom overhaul of our institutions that plan ,UNGD
USA,1992,"and administer foreign assistance, drastically reducing the bureaucracy that ",UNGD
USA,1992,"has built up around Government-based programmes, streamlining our delivery ",UNGD
USA,1992,systems and strengthening support for private-sector development and economic ,UNGD
USA,1992,reform. ,UNGD
USA,1992,"The Agency for International Development (AID), another institution born ",UNGD
USA,1992,"during the cold war, needs to be fundamentally and radically overhauled. ",UNGD
USA,1992,"Promoting economic security, opportunity and competitiveness will become a ",UNGD
USA,1992,primary mission of the State Department. Our assistance efforts should not be ,UNGD
USA,1992,"charity. On the contrary, they should promote mutual prosperity. Therefore, ",UNGD
USA,1992,"using existing foreign-affairs resources, I will propose creating a $1 billion ",UNGD
USA,1992,growth fund. The fund will provide grants and credits to support United ,UNGD
USA,1992,"States businesses in providing expertise, goods and services desperately ",UNGD
USA,1992,needed in countries undertaking economic restructuring. ,UNGD
USA,1992,I will also support significantly increasing the programmes of the ,UNGD
USA,1992,Export-Import Bank to ensure that United States products and technology ,UNGD
USA,1992,promote investment in world-wide economic growth. ,UNGD
USA,1992,"The United States will work with its global partners, especially the G-7 ",UNGD
USA,1992,"nations, to enhance global growth at this key point in world history, as we ",UNGD
USA,1992,end one era and begin another. ,UNGD
USA,1992,"None of us can afford insular policies. Each of us must contribute, ",UNGD
USA,1992,"through greater coordinated action, to building ¬£ stronger world economy. ",UNGD
USA,1992,,UNGD
USA,1992,I realize that what I have outlined today is an ambitious agenda. But we ,UNGD
USA,1992,"live in remarkable times: times when empires collapse, ideologies dissolve ",UNGD
USA,1992,and walls crumble; times when change can come so fast that we sometimes forget ,UNGD
USA,1992,how far and how fast we have progressed in achieving our hopes for a global ,UNGD
USA,1992,community of democratic nations. ,UNGD
USA,1992,,UNGD
USA,1992,"And in the face of today's changes, with the loss of so much that was ",UNGD
USA,1992,"familiar and predictable, there is now a great temptation for people ",UNGD
USA,1992,everywhere to turn inward and to build walls around themselves walls against ,UNGD
USA,1992,"trade, walls against people, walls against ideas and investment, walls against ",UNGD
USA,1992,anything at all that appears new and different. ,UNGD
USA,1992,"As the Berlin Wall fell, these walls too must fall. They must fall ",UNGD
USA,1992,because we cannot separate our fate from that of others. Our peace is so ,UNGD
USA,1992,"interconnected, our security so intertwined, our prosperity so interdependent, ",UNGD
USA,1992,that to turn inward and retreat from the world is to invite disaster and ,UNGD
USA,1992,defeat. ,UNGD
USA,1992,"At the threshold of a new century we can truly say a more peaceful, more ",UNGD
USA,1992,"secure, more prosperous future beckons to us. For the sake of our children ",UNGD
USA,1992,"and our grandchildren, for the sake of those who perished during the cold war ",UNGD
USA,1992,"and for the sake of every man, woman and child who kept freedom's flame alive ",UNGD
USA,1992,"even during the darkest noon, let us pledge ourselves to make that future ",UNGD
USA,1992,"real, and let us pledge ourselves to fulfil the promise of a truly United ",UNGD
USA,1992,Nations. ,UNGD
USA,1992,Thank you and may God bless you all. ,UNGD
USA,1993,"Let me first congratulate you,",UNGD
USA,1993,"Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly",UNGD
USA,1993,for this session.,UNGD
USA,1993,"Mr. Secretary-General, distinguished representatives and",UNGD
USA,1993,"guests, it is a great honour for me to address you and to",UNGD
USA,1993,"stand in this great Hall, which symbolizes so much of the",UNGD
USA,1993,twentieth century - its darkest crises and its brightest,UNGD
USA,1993,aspirations.,UNGD
USA,1993,I come before you as the first American President born,UNGD
USA,1993,after the founding of the United Nations. Like most of the,UNGD
USA,1993,"people in the world today, I was not even alive during the",UNGD
USA,1993,convulsive world war that convinced humankind of the need,UNGD
USA,1993,"for this Organization, nor during the San Francisco",UNGD
USA,1993,Conference that led to its birth. Yet I have followed the,UNGD
USA,1993,"work of the United Nations throughout my life, with",UNGD
USA,1993,"admiration for its accomplishments, sadness for its failures",UNGD
USA,1993,"and the conviction that, through common effort, our",UNGD
USA,1993,generation can take the bold steps needed to redeem the,UNGD
USA,1993,mission entrusted to the United Nations 48 years ago. I,UNGD
USA,1993,pledge to you that my nation remains committed to helping,UNGD
USA,1993,make the United Nations vision a reality.,UNGD
USA,1993,The start of this session of the General Assembly offers,UNGD
USA,1993,us an opportunity to take stock of where we are as common,UNGD
USA,1993,shareholders in the progress of humankind and the,UNGD
USA,1993,preservation of our planet. It is clear that we live at a,UNGD
USA,1993,turning point in human history.,UNGD
USA,1993,Immense and promising changes seem to wash over us,UNGD
USA,1993,every day. The cold war is over. The world is no longer,UNGD
USA,1993,divided into two armed and angry camps. Dozens of new,UNGD
USA,1993,democracies have been born.,UNGD
USA,1993,It is a moment of miracles. We see Nelson Mandela,UNGD
USA,1993,stand side by side with President de Klerk proclaiming a,UNGD
USA,1993,date for South Africa’s first non-racial elections.,UNGD
USA,1993,"We see Russia’s first popularly elected President,",UNGD
USA,1993,"Boris Yeltsin, leading his nation on its bold democratic",UNGD
USA,1993,journey.,UNGD
USA,1993,We have seen decades of deadlock shattered in the,UNGD
USA,1993,Middle East as the Prime Minister of Israel and the,UNGD
USA,1993,Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization reached,UNGD
USA,1993,past enmity and suspicion to shake each other’s hand and,UNGD
USA,1993,exhilarate the entire world with the hope of peace.,UNGD
USA,1993,We have begun to see the doomsday weapons of,UNGD
USA,1993,nuclear annihilation dismantled and destroyed. Thirty-two,UNGD
USA,1993,years ago President Kennedy warned this Assembly that,UNGD
USA,1993,humanity lived under a nuclear sword of Damocles that hung,UNGD
USA,1993,by the slenderest of threads. Now the United States is,UNGD
USA,1993,"working with Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and others to take",UNGD
USA,1993,"that sword down, to lock it away in a secure vault, where we",UNGD
USA,1993,hope and pray it will remain for ever.,UNGD
USA,1993,It is a new era in this Hall as well. The super-Power,UNGD
USA,1993,standoff that for so long stymied the work of the United,UNGD
USA,1993,"Nations, almost from its first day, has now yielded to a new",UNGD
USA,1993,promise of practical cooperation.,UNGD
USA,1993,Yet today we must all admit that there are two,UNGD
USA,1993,powerful tendencies working from opposite directions to,UNGD
USA,1993,challenge the authority of nation States everywhere and to,UNGD
USA,1993,undermine the authority of nation States to work together.,UNGD
USA,1993,"From beyond nations, economic and technological forces all",UNGD
USA,1993,over the globe are compelling the world towards integration.,UNGD
USA,1993,These forces are fuelling a welcome explosion of,UNGD
USA,1993,entrepreneurship and political liberalization. But they also,UNGD
USA,1993,threaten to destroy the insularity and independence of,UNGD
USA,1993,"national economies, quickening the pace of change and",UNGD
USA,1993,making many of our people feel more insecure. At the same,UNGD
USA,1993,"time, from within nations, the resurgent aspirations of ethnic",UNGD
USA,1993,and religious groups challenge Governments on terms that,UNGD
USA,1993,traditional nation States cannot easily accommodate. These,UNGD
USA,1993,"twin forces lie at the heart of the challenges, not only to our",UNGD
USA,1993,"national Governments, but also to all our international",UNGD
USA,1993,institutions. They require all of us in this Hall to find new,UNGD
USA,1993,ways to work together more effectively in pursuit of our,UNGD
USA,1993,national interests and to think anew about whether our,UNGD
USA,1993,institutions of international cooperation are adequate to this,UNGD
USA,1993,moment.,UNGD
USA,1993,"Thus, as we marvel at this era’s promise of new peace,",UNGD
USA,1993,we must also recognize that serious threats remain. Bloody,UNGD
USA,1993,"ethnic, religious and civil wars rage from Angola to the",UNGD
USA,1993,Caucasus to Kashmir. As weapons of mass destruction fall,UNGD
USA,1993,"into more hands, even small conflicts can threaten to take on",UNGD
USA,1993,murderous proportions. Hunger and disease continue to take,UNGD
USA,1993,"a tragic toll, especially among the world’s children. The",UNGD
USA,1993,malignant neglect of our global environment threatens our,UNGD
USA,1993,children’s health and their very security. The repression of,UNGD
USA,1993,"conscience continues in too many nations. And terrorism,",UNGD
USA,1993,"which has taken so many innocent lives, assumed a",UNGD
USA,1993,horrifying immediacy for us here when militant fanatics,UNGD
USA,1993,bombed the World Trade Center and planned to attack even,UNGD
USA,1993,this very Hall of peace.,UNGD
USA,1993,Let me assure the Assembly that whether they be the,UNGD
USA,1993,plotters of those crimes or the mass murderers who bombed,UNGD
USA,1993,"Pan Am flight 103, my Government is determined to see that",UNGD
USA,1993,such terrorists are brought to justice.,UNGD
USA,1993,"At this moment of panoramic change, of vast",UNGD
USA,1993,"opportunities and troubling threats, we must all ask ourselves",UNGD
USA,1993,what we can and what we should do as a community of,UNGD
USA,1993,nations. We must once again dare to dream of what might,UNGD
USA,1993,"be, for our dreams may be within our reach.",UNGD
USA,1993,"For that to happen, we must all be willing honestly to",UNGD
USA,1993,confront the challenges of the broader world. That has never,UNGD
USA,1993,been easy. When this Organization was founded 48 years,UNGD
USA,1993,"ago, the world’s nations stood devastated by war or",UNGD
USA,1993,exhausted by its expense. There was little appetite for,UNGD
USA,1993,cooperative efforts among nations; most people simply,UNGD
USA,1993,wanted to get on with their lives. But a far-sighted,UNGD
USA,1993,generation of leaders from the United States and elsewhere,UNGD
USA,1993,rallied the world. Their efforts built the institutions of post-,UNGD
USA,1993,-war security and prosperity.,UNGD
USA,1993,We are at a similar moment today. The momentum of,UNGD
USA,1993,the cold war no longer propels us in our daily actions. And,UNGD
USA,1993,with daunting economic and political pressures upon almost,UNGD
USA,1993,"every nation represented in this room, many of us are",UNGD
USA,1993,turning to focus greater attention and energy on domestic,UNGD
USA,1993,"needs and problems, and we must.",UNGD
USA,1993,But putting each of our economic houses in order,UNGD
USA,1993,cannot mean that we shut our windows to the world. The,UNGD
USA,1993,pursuit of self-renewal in many of the world’s largest and,UNGD
USA,1993,"most powerful economies - in Europe, in Japan, in North",UNGD
USA,1993,"America - is absolutely crucial, because unless the great",UNGD
USA,1993,industrial nations can recapture their robust economic,UNGD
USA,1993,"growth, the global economy will languish. Yet the industrial",UNGD
USA,1993,nations also need growth elsewhere in order to lift their own.,UNGD
USA,1993,"Indeed, prosperity in each of our nations and regions also",UNGD
USA,1993,depends on active and responsible engagement in a host of,UNGD
USA,1993,"shared concerns: for example, a thriving and democratic",UNGD
USA,1993,"Russia not only makes the world safer, it also can help to",UNGD
USA,1993,expand the world’s economy; a strong GATT (General,UNGD
USA,1993,Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) agreement will create,UNGD
USA,1993,"millions of jobs world wide; peace in the Middle East,",UNGD
USA,1993,buttressed as it should be by the repeal of outdated United,UNGD
USA,1993,"Nations resolutions, can help to unleash that region’s great",UNGD
USA,1993,economic potential and calm a perpetual source of tension in,UNGD
USA,1993,global affairs; and the growing economic power of China -,UNGD
USA,1993,coupled with greater political openness - could bring,UNGD
USA,1993,enormous benefits to all of Asia and to the rest of the world.,UNGD
USA,1993,We must help our publics to understand this distinction:,UNGD
USA,1993,domestic renewal is an overdue tonic; but isolationism and,UNGD
USA,1993,protectionism are still poison. We must inspire our peoples,UNGD
USA,1993,to look beyond their immediate fears towards a broader,UNGD
USA,1993,horizon.,UNGD
USA,1993,Let me start by being clear about where the United,UNGD
USA,1993,States stands. The United States occupies a unique position,UNGD
USA,1993,in world affairs today: we recognize that and we welcome,UNGD
USA,1993,"it. Yet, with the cold war over, I know many people ask",UNGD
USA,1993,whether the United States plans to retreat or remain active,UNGD
USA,1993,"in the world; and if active, to what end? Many people are",UNGD
USA,1993,asking that in our own country as well.,UNGD
USA,1993,Let me answer that question as clearly and plainly as I,UNGD
USA,1993,can. The United States intends to remain engaged and to,UNGD
USA,1993,"lead. We cannot solve every problem, but we must and will",UNGD
USA,1993,serve as a fulcrum for change and a pivot point for peace.,UNGD
USA,1993,"In a new era of peril and opportunity, our overriding",UNGD
USA,1993,purpose must be to expand and strengthen the world’s,UNGD
USA,1993,community of market-based democracies. During the cold,UNGD
USA,1993,"war, we sought to contain a threat to the survival of free",UNGD
USA,1993,institutions; now we seek to enlarge the circle of nations that,UNGD
USA,1993,live under those free institutions.,UNGD
USA,1993,For our dream is of a day when the opinions and,UNGD
USA,1993,energies of every person in the world will be given full,UNGD
USA,1993,"expression, in a world of thriving democracies that cooperate",UNGD
USA,1993,with each other and live in peace.,UNGD
USA,1993,"With this statement, I do not mean to announce some",UNGD
USA,1993,crusade to force our way of life and doing things on others,UNGD
USA,1993,or to replicate our institutions. But we now know clearly,UNGD
USA,1993,"that throughout the world, from Poland to Eritrea, from",UNGD
USA,1993,"Guatemala to South Korea, there is an enormous yearning",UNGD
USA,1993,among people who wish to be the masters of their own,UNGD
USA,1993,economic and political lives. Where it matters most and,UNGD
USA,1993,"where we can make the greatest difference, we will therefore",UNGD
USA,1993,patiently and firmly align ourselves with that yearning.,UNGD
USA,1993,Forty-eighth session - 27 September l993 9,UNGD
USA,1993,"Today, there are still those who claim that democracy",UNGD
USA,1993,is simply not applicable to many cultures and that its recent,UNGD
USA,1993,"expansion is an aberration, an accident in history that will",UNGD
USA,1993,"soon fade away. But I agree with President Roosevelt, who",UNGD
USA,1993,"once said: ""The democratic aspiration is no mere recent",UNGD
USA,1993,"phase of human history. It is human history.""",UNGD
USA,1993,We will work to strengthen the free market democracies,UNGD
USA,1993,"by revitalizing our economy at home, by opening world",UNGD
USA,1993,"trade through GATT, the North American Free Trade",UNGD
USA,1993,"Agreement and other accords, and by updating our shared",UNGD
USA,1993,"institutions, asking with you and answering the hard",UNGD
USA,1993,questions about whether they are adequate to the present,UNGD
USA,1993,challenges.,UNGD
USA,1993,We will support the consolidation of market democracy,UNGD
USA,1993,"where it is taking new root, as in the States of the former",UNGD
USA,1993,"Soviet Union and all over Latin America, and we seek to",UNGD
USA,1993,foster the practices of good government that distribute the,UNGD
USA,1993,benefits of democracy and economic growth fairly to all,UNGD
USA,1993,people.,UNGD
USA,1993,We will work to reduce the threat from regimes that are,UNGD
USA,1993,hostile to democracy and to support liberalization of,UNGD
USA,1993,non-democratic States when they are willing to live in peace,UNGD
USA,1993,"with the rest of us. As a country that has over 150 racial,",UNGD
USA,1993,"ethnic and religious groups within our borders, our policy is",UNGD
USA,1993,and must be rooted in a profound respect for all the world’s,UNGD
USA,1993,religions and cultures. But we must oppose everywhere,UNGD
USA,1993,extremism that produces terrorism and hate.,UNGD
USA,1993,And we must pursue our humanitarian goals of,UNGD
USA,1993,"reducing suffering, fostering sustainable development and",UNGD
USA,1993,"improving health and living conditions, particularly for our",UNGD
USA,1993,world’s children.,UNGD
USA,1993,On efforts from export controls to trade agreements to,UNGD
USA,1993,"peace-keeping, we will often work in partnership with others",UNGD
USA,1993,and through multilateral institutions such as the United,UNGD
USA,1993,Nations. It is in our national interest to do so. But we must,UNGD
USA,1993,not hesitate to act unilaterally when there is a threat to our,UNGD
USA,1993,core interests or to those of our allies.,UNGD
USA,1993,The United States believes that an expanding,UNGD
USA,1993,community of market democracies not only serves our own,UNGD
USA,1993,"security interests, it also advances the goals enshrined in this",UNGD
USA,1993,body’s Charter and its Universal Declaration of Human,UNGD
USA,1993,Rights.,UNGD
USA,1993,For broadly based prosperity is clearly the strongest,UNGD
USA,1993,"form of preventive diplomacy, and the habits of democracy",UNGD
USA,1993,are the habits of peace. Democracy is rooted in,UNGD
USA,1993,"compromise, not conquest. It rewards tolerance, not hatred.",UNGD
USA,1993,Democracies rarely wage war on one another. They make,UNGD
USA,1993,"more reliable partners in trade, in diplomacy, and in the",UNGD
USA,1993,"stewardship of our global environment. And democracies,",UNGD
USA,1993,"with the rule of law and respect for political, religious and",UNGD
USA,1993,"cultural minorities, are more responsive to their own people",UNGD
USA,1993,and to the protection of human rights.,UNGD
USA,1993,"But as we work towards this vision, we must confront",UNGD
USA,1993,the storm clouds that may overwhelm our work and darken,UNGD
USA,1993,the march towards freedom.,UNGD
USA,1993,If we do not stem the proliferation of the world’s,UNGD
USA,1993,"deadliest weapons, no democracy can feel secure.",UNGD
USA,1993,If we do not strengthen the capacity to resolve conflicts,UNGD
USA,1993,"among and within nations, those conflicts will smother the",UNGD
USA,1993,"birth of free institutions, threaten the development of entire",UNGD
USA,1993,regions and continue to take innocent lives.,UNGD
USA,1993,If we do not nurture our people and our planet through,UNGD
USA,1993,"sustainable development, we will deepen conflict and waste",UNGD
USA,1993,the very wonders that make our efforts worth doing.,UNGD
USA,1993,Let me talk more about what I believe we must do in,UNGD
USA,1993,"each of these three categories: non-proliferation, conflict",UNGD
USA,1993,resolution and sustainable development.,UNGD
USA,1993,One of our most urgent priorities must be attacking the,UNGD
USA,1993,proliferation of weapons of mass destruction - whether,UNGD
USA,1993,"nuclear, chemical or biological - and the ballistic missiles",UNGD
USA,1993,that can rain them down on populations hundreds of miles,UNGD
USA,1993,away.,UNGD
USA,1993,We know this is not an idle problem. All of us are still,UNGD
USA,1993,haunted by the pictures of Kurdish women and children cut,UNGD
USA,1993,down by poison gas. We saw SCUD missiles drop during,UNGD
USA,1993,the Gulf War that would have been far graver in their,UNGD
USA,1993,consequences if they had carried nuclear weapons. And we,UNGD
USA,1993,know that many nations still believe it is in their interests to,UNGD
USA,1993,develop weapons of mass destruction or to sell them or the,UNGD
USA,1993,necessary technologies to others for financial gain.,UNGD
USA,1993,More than a score of nations likely possess such,UNGD
USA,1993,weapons and their number threatens to grow. These,UNGD
USA,1993,weapons destabilize entire regions. They could turn a local,UNGD
USA,1993,conflict into a global human and environmental catastrophe.,UNGD
USA,1993,We simply have got to find ways to control these weapons,UNGD
USA,1993,and to reduce the number of States that possess them by,UNGD
USA,1993,supporting and strengthening the International Atomic,UNGD
USA,1993,Energy Agency and by taking other necessary measures.,UNGD
USA,1993,10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session,UNGD
USA,1993,I have made non-proliferation one of our nation’s,UNGD
USA,1993,highest priorities. We intend to weave it more deeply into,UNGD
USA,1993,the fabric of all of our relationships with the world’s nations,UNGD
USA,1993,and institutions. We seek to build a world of increasing,UNGD
USA,1993,pressure for non-proliferation but increasingly open trade and,UNGD
USA,1993,technology for those States that live by accepted,UNGD
USA,1993,international rules.,UNGD
USA,1993,"Today, let me describe several new policies that our",UNGD
USA,1993,Government will pursue to stem proliferation. We will,UNGD
USA,1993,pursue new steps to control the materials for nuclear,UNGD
USA,1993,weapons. Growing global stockpiles of plutonium and,UNGD
USA,1993,highly enriched uranium are raising the danger of nuclear,UNGD
USA,1993,terrorism for all nations. We will press for an international,UNGD
USA,1993,agreement that would ban production of these materials for,UNGD
USA,1993,weapons for ever.,UNGD
USA,1993,"As we reduce our nuclear stockpiles, the United States",UNGD
USA,1993,has also begun negotiations towards a comprehensive ban on,UNGD
USA,1993,nuclear testing. This summer I declared that to facilitate,UNGD
USA,1993,"those negotiations, our nation would suspend our testing if",UNGD
USA,1993,"all other nuclear States would do the same. Today, in the",UNGD
USA,1993,"face of disturbing signs, I renew my call on the nuclear",UNGD
USA,1993,States to abide by that moratorium as we negotiate to stop,UNGD
USA,1993,nuclear testing for all time.,UNGD
USA,1993,I am also proposing new efforts to fight the,UNGD
USA,1993,"proliferation of biological and chemical weapons. Today,",UNGD
USA,1993,only a handful of nations has ratified the chemical weapons,UNGD
USA,1993,Convention. I call on all nations - including my own - to,UNGD
USA,1993,ratify this accord quickly so that it may enter into force by,UNGD
USA,1993,13 January 1995. We will also seek to strengthen the,UNGD
USA,1993,biological weapons Convention by making every nation’s,UNGD
USA,1993,biological activities and facilities open to more international,UNGD
USA,1993,scrutiny.,UNGD
USA,1993,I am proposing as well new steps to thwart the,UNGD
USA,1993,"proliferation of ballistic missiles. Recently, working with",UNGD
USA,1993,"Russia, Argentina, Hungary and South Africa, we have made",UNGD
USA,1993,significant progress toward that goal. Now we will seek to,UNGD
USA,1993,strengthen the principles of the Missile Technology Control,UNGD
USA,1993,Regime by transforming it from an agreement on technology,UNGD
USA,1993,transfer among just 23 nations into a set of rules that can,UNGD
USA,1993,command universal adherence.,UNGD
USA,1993,We will also reform our own system of export controls,UNGD
USA,1993,in the United States to reflect the realities of the post-cold-,UNGD
USA,1993,"war world, where we seek to enlist the support of our former",UNGD
USA,1993,adversaries in the battle against proliferation. At the same,UNGD
USA,1993,time as we stop deadly technologies from falling into the,UNGD
USA,1993,"wrong hands, we will work with our partners to remove",UNGD
USA,1993,outdated controls that unfairly burden legitimate commerce,UNGD
USA,1993,and unduly restrain growth and opportunity all over the,UNGD
USA,1993,world.,UNGD
USA,1993,As we work to keep the world’s most destructive,UNGD
USA,1993,"weapons out of conflicts, we must also strengthen the",UNGD
USA,1993,international community’s ability to address those conflicts,UNGD
USA,1993,"themselves. For as we all now know so painfully, the end",UNGD
USA,1993,of the cold war did not bring us to the millennium of peace.,UNGD
USA,1993,"Indeed, it simply removed the lid from many cauldrons of",UNGD
USA,1993,"ethnic, religious and territorial animosity.",UNGD
USA,1993,The philosopher Isaiah Berlin has said that a wounded,UNGD
USA,1993,"nationalism is like a bent twig, forced down so severely that",UNGD
USA,1993,"when released, it lashes back with fury. The world today is",UNGD
USA,1993,thick with both bent and recoiling twigs of wounded,UNGD
USA,1993,communal identities. This surge of bitter conflicts has,UNGD
USA,1993,placed high demands on the United Nations peace-keeping,UNGD
USA,1993,"forces. Frequently, the Blue Helmets have worked wonders.",UNGD
USA,1993,"In Namibia, El Salvador, the Golan Heights and elsewhere,",UNGD
USA,1993,United Nations peace-keepers have helped to stop the,UNGD
USA,1993,"fighting, restore civil authority and enable free elections. In",UNGD
USA,1993,"Bosnia, United Nations peace-keepers, against the danger",UNGD
USA,1993,"and frustration of that continuing tragedy, have maintained",UNGD
USA,1993,a valiant humanitarian effort. And if the parties to that,UNGD
USA,1993,"conflict take the hard steps needed to make a real peace, the",UNGD
USA,1993,international community - including the United States - must,UNGD
USA,1993,be ready to help in its effective implementation.,UNGD
USA,1993,"In Somalia, the United States and the United Nations",UNGD
USA,1993,have worked together to achieve a stunning humanitarian,UNGD
USA,1993,"rescue, saving literally hundreds of thousands of lives and",UNGD
USA,1993,restoring conditions of security to almost the entire country.,UNGD
USA,1993,United Nations peace-keepers from over two dozen nations,UNGD
USA,1993,"remain in Somalia today - and some, including brave",UNGD
USA,1993,"Americans, have lost their lives - to ensure that we complete",UNGD
USA,1993,our mission and that anarchy and starvation do not return,UNGD
USA,1993,just as quickly as they were abolished.,UNGD
USA,1993,"Many still criticize United Nations peace-keeping, but",UNGD
USA,1993,"those who do should talk to the people of Cambodia, where",UNGD
USA,1993,the United Nations operations helped turn the killing fields,UNGD
USA,1993,into fertile soil for reconciliation. Last May’s elections in,UNGD
USA,1993,Cambodia marked a proud accomplishment for that war--,UNGD
USA,1993,weary nation and for the United Nations. And I am pleased,UNGD
USA,1993,to announce that the United States has recognized,UNGD
USA,1993,Cambodia’s new Government.,UNGD
USA,1993,United Nations peace-keeping holds the promise to,UNGD
USA,1993,resolve many of this era’s conflicts. But the reason we have,UNGD
USA,1993,"supported such missions is not, as some critics in the United",UNGD
USA,1993,"States have charged, to subcontract American foreign policy,",UNGD
USA,1993,"but to strengthen our security, to protect our interests, and to",UNGD
USA,1993,Forty-eighth session - 27 September l993 11,UNGD
USA,1993,share among nations the costs and effort of pursuing peace.,UNGD
USA,1993,Peace-keeping cannot be a substitute for our own national,UNGD
USA,1993,"defence efforts, but it can strongly supplement them.",UNGD
USA,1993,Today there is wide recognition that the United Nations,UNGD
USA,1993,peace-keeping ability has not kept pace with its rising,UNGD
USA,1993,"responsibilities and challenges. Just six years ago, about",UNGD
USA,1993,"10,000 United Nations peace-keepers were stationed around",UNGD
USA,1993,"the world. Today the United Nations has some 80,000",UNGD
USA,1993,deployed in 17 operations on four continents. Yet until,UNGD
USA,1993,"recently, if a peace-keeping commander called in from",UNGD
USA,1993,"across the globe when it was night-time here in New York,",UNGD
USA,1993,there was no one in the peace-keeping office even to answer,UNGD
USA,1993,"the call. When lives are on the line, we cannot let the reach",UNGD
USA,1993,of the United Nations exceed its grasp.,UNGD
USA,1993,"As the Secretary-General and others have argued, if",UNGD
USA,1993,United Nations peace-keeping is to be a sound security,UNGD
USA,1993,investment for our nation and for other United Nations,UNGD
USA,1993,"Members, it must adapt to new times. Together, we must",UNGD
USA,1993,prepare United Nations peace-keeping for the twenty-first,UNGD
USA,1993,century. We need to begin by bringing the rigours of,UNGD
USA,1993,military and political analysis to every United Nations peace,UNGD
USA,1993,"mission. In recent weeks in the Security Council, our nation",UNGD
USA,1993,has begun asking harder questions about proposals for new,UNGD
USA,1993,peace-keeping missions. Is there a real threat to,UNGD
USA,1993,international peace? Does the proposed mission have clear,UNGD
USA,1993,objectives? Can an end point be identified for those who,UNGD
USA,1993,will be asked to participate? How much will the mission,UNGD
USA,1993,cost? From now on the United Nations should address these,UNGD
USA,1993,and other questions for every proposed mission before we,UNGD
USA,1993,vote and before the mission begins. The United Nations,UNGD
USA,1993,simply cannot become engaged in every one of the world’s,UNGD
USA,1993,"conflicts. If the American people are to say ""Yes"" to United",UNGD
USA,1993,"Nations peace-keeping, the United Nations must know when",UNGD
USA,1993,"to say ""No"".",UNGD
USA,1993,The United Nations also must have the technical means,UNGD
USA,1993,"to run a modern, world-class peace-keeping operation. We",UNGD
USA,1993,support the creation of a genuine United Nations peace-,UNGD
USA,1993,keeping headquarters with a planning staff; with access to,UNGD
USA,1993,timely intelligence; with a logistics unit that can be deployed,UNGD
USA,1993,on a moment’s notice; and with a modern operations centre,UNGD
USA,1993,with global communications.,UNGD
USA,1993,United Nations operations must not only be adequately,UNGD
USA,1993,"funded but also fairly funded. Within the next few weeks,",UNGD
USA,1993,the United States will be current on our peace-keeping bills.,UNGD
USA,1993,I have worked hard with the Congress to get this done. I,UNGD
USA,1993,believe the United States should lead the way in being,UNGD
USA,1993,"timely in its payments, and I will work to ensure that we",UNGD
USA,1993,continue to pay our peace-keeping bills in full. But I am,UNGD
USA,1993,also committed to working with the United Nations to reduce,UNGD
USA,1993,our nation’s assessment for these missions. The assessment,UNGD
USA,1993,"system has not been changed since 1973, and everyone in",UNGD
USA,1993,our country knows that our percentage of the world’s,UNGD
USA,1993,"economic pie is not as great as it was then. Therefore, I",UNGD
USA,1993,believe our rate should be reduced to reflect the rise of other,UNGD
USA,1993,nations that can now bear more of the financial burden.,UNGD
USA,1993,That will make it easier for me as President to make sure,UNGD
USA,1993,my country pays in a timely and full fashion.,UNGD
USA,1993,Changes in the United Nations peace-keeping operations,UNGD
USA,1993,must be part of an even broader programme of United,UNGD
USA,1993,"Nations reform. I say that, again, not to criticize the United",UNGD
USA,1993,"Nations but to help improve it. As our Ambassador,",UNGD
USA,1993,"Madeleine Albright, has suggested, the United States has",UNGD
USA,1993,always played a twin role in regard to the United Nations:,UNGD
USA,1993,"""First friend and first critic.""",UNGD
USA,1993,"Today, corporations around the world are finding ways",UNGD
USA,1993,to move from the industrial age into the information age -,UNGD
USA,1993,"improving service, reducing bureaucracy and cutting costs.",UNGD
USA,1993,"Here in the United States, Vice President Al Gore and I have",UNGD
USA,1993,launched an effort literally to reinvent how our Government,UNGD
USA,1993,operates. We see this going on in other Governments,UNGD
USA,1993,around the world. Now the time has come to reinvent the,UNGD
USA,1993,way the United Nations operates as well.,UNGD
USA,1993,I applaud the initial steps the Secretary-General has,UNGD
USA,1993,taken to reduce and reform the United Nations bureaucracy.,UNGD
USA,1993,Now we must all do even more to root out waste. Before,UNGD
USA,1993,"this General Assembly is over, let us establish a strong",UNGD
USA,1993,"mandate for an office of inspector general, so that it can",UNGD
USA,1993,"attain a reputation for toughness, for integrity, for",UNGD
USA,1993,effectiveness. Let us build new confidence among our,UNGD
USA,1993,people that the United Nations is changing with the needs of,UNGD
USA,1993,our times.,UNGD
USA,1993,"Ultimately, the key for reforming the United Nations,",UNGD
USA,1993,"as for reforming our own government, is to remember why",UNGD
USA,1993,we are here and whom we serve. It is well to recall that the,UNGD
USA,1993,"first words of the United Nations Charter are not, ""We the",UNGD
USA,1993,"Governments"", but ""We the peoples of the United Nations"".",UNGD
USA,1993,"That means, in every country, the teachers, the workers, the",UNGD
USA,1993,"farmers, the professionals, the fathers, the mothers, the",UNGD
USA,1993,"children, from the most remote village in the world to the",UNGD
USA,1993,largest metropolis - they are why we gather in this great,UNGD
USA,1993,Hall; it is their futures that are at risk when we act or fail to,UNGD
USA,1993,act; and it is they who ultimately pay our bills.,UNGD
USA,1993,As we dream new dreams in this age when miracles,UNGD
USA,1993,"seem possible, let us focus on the lives of those people, and",UNGD
USA,1993,especially on the children who will inherit this world. Let,UNGD
USA,1993,12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session,UNGD
USA,1993,"us work with a new urgency, and imagine what kind of",UNGD
USA,1993,world we could create for them over the coming generation.,UNGD
USA,1993,Let us work with new energy to protect the world’s,UNGD
USA,1993,people from torture and repression. As Secretary of State,UNGD
USA,1993,"Christopher stressed at the recent Vienna Conference, human",UNGD
USA,1993,"rights are not something conditional, bounded by culture but,",UNGD
USA,1993,"rather, something universal, granted by God. This General",UNGD
USA,1993,"Assembly should create, at long last, a high commissioner",UNGD
USA,1993,"for human rights. I hope it will do this soon, and with",UNGD
USA,1993,vigour and energy and conviction.,UNGD
USA,1993,Let us also work far more ambitiously to fulfil our,UNGD
USA,1993,"obligations as custodians of this planet, not only to improve",UNGD
USA,1993,"the quality of life for our citizens and the quality of our air,",UNGD
USA,1993,"water and the earth itself, but also because the roots of",UNGD
USA,1993,conflict are so often entangled with the roots of,UNGD
USA,1993,environmental neglect and the calamities of famine and,UNGD
USA,1993,disease.,UNGD
USA,1993,During the course of our campaign in the United States,UNGD
USA,1993,"last year, Vice President Gore and I promised the American",UNGD
USA,1993,people major changes in our nation’s policy towards the,UNGD
USA,1993,"global environment. Those were promises to keep, and",UNGD
USA,1993,today the United States is doing so. Today we are working,UNGD
USA,1993,with other nations to build on the promising work of the,UNGD
USA,1993,United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development.,UNGD
USA,1993,We are working to make sure that all nations meet their,UNGD
USA,1993,commitments under the global climate Convention. We are,UNGD
USA,1993,seeking to complete negotiations on an accord to prevent the,UNGD
USA,1993,world’s deserts from further expanding. And we seek to,UNGD
USA,1993,strengthen the World Health Organization’s efforts to combat,UNGD
USA,1993,"the plague of AIDS, which is not only killing millions, but",UNGD
USA,1993,also exhausting the resources of the nations that can least,UNGD
USA,1993,afford it.,UNGD
USA,1993,And let us make a new commitment to the world’s,UNGD
USA,1993,children. It is tragic enough that one and a half million,UNGD
USA,1993,children have died as a result of wars over the past decade.,UNGD
USA,1993,But it is far more unforgivable that during that same period,UNGD
USA,1993,40 million children have died from diseases completely,UNGD
USA,1993,preventable with simple vaccines or medicines. Every day,UNGD
USA,1993,"- this day, as we meet here - over 30,000 of the world’s",UNGD
USA,1993,children will die of malnutrition and disease. As the,UNGD
USA,1993,"Director of the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF),",UNGD
USA,1993,"Jim Grant, has reminded me, ""each of [those children] had",UNGD
USA,1993,"a name and a nationality, a family, a personality and a",UNGD
USA,1993,"potential"".",UNGD
USA,1993,We are compelled to do better by the world’s children.,UNGD
USA,1993,Just as our own nation has launched new reforms to ensure,UNGD
USA,1993,"that every child has adequate health care, we must do more",UNGD
USA,1993,to get basic vaccines and other treatments for curable,UNGD
USA,1993,diseases to children all over the world. It’s the best,UNGD
USA,1993,investment we’ll ever make. We can find new ways to,UNGD
USA,1993,"ensure that every child grows up with clean, drinkable water",UNGD
USA,1993,- that most precious commodity of life itself. And the,UNGD
USA,1993,United Nations can work even harder to ensure that each,UNGD
USA,1993,child has at least a full primary education - and I mean that,UNGD
USA,1993,opportunity for girls as well as boys.,UNGD
USA,1993,"To ensure a healthier and more abundant world, we",UNGD
USA,1993,simply must slow the world’s explosive growth in,UNGD
USA,1993,population. We cannot afford to see the human race double,UNGD
USA,1993,by the middle of the next century. Our nation has at last,UNGD
USA,1993,renewed its commitment to work with the United Nations to,UNGD
USA,1993,expand the availability of the world’s family planning,UNGD
USA,1993,education and services. We must ensure that there is a place,UNGD
USA,1993,at the table for every one of the world’s children. We can,UNGD
USA,1993,do this.,UNGD
USA,1993,"At the birth of this Organization, 48 years ago - another",UNGD
USA,1993,time of both victory and danger - a generation of gifted,UNGD
USA,1993,leaders from many nations stepped forward to organize the,UNGD
USA,1993,world’s efforts on behalf of security and prosperity. One,UNGD
USA,1993,"American leader during that period said this: ""It is time we",UNGD
USA,1993,steered by the stars rather than by the light of each passing,UNGD
USA,1993,"ship."" His generation picked peace, human dignity and",UNGD
USA,1993,freedom. Those are good stars. They should remain the,UNGD
USA,1993,highest in our firmament.,UNGD
USA,1993,Now history has granted to us a moment of even,UNGD
USA,1993,"greater opportunity, when old dangers are ebbing and old",UNGD
USA,1993,"walls are crumbling. Future generations will judge us, every",UNGD
USA,1993,"one of us, above all by what we make of this magic",UNGD
USA,1993,"moment. Let us resolve that we will dream larger, that we",UNGD
USA,1993,"will work harder, so that they can conclude that we did not",UNGD
USA,1993,"merely turn walls to rubble, but instead laid the foundations",UNGD
USA,1993,for great things to come.,UNGD
USA,1993,Let us ensure that the tide of freedom and democracy,UNGD
USA,1993,is not pushed back by the fierce winds of ethnic hatred. Let,UNGD
USA,1993,us ensure that the world’s most dangerous weapons are,UNGD
USA,1993,safely reduced and denied to dangerous hands. Let us,UNGD
USA,1993,"ensure that the world we pass to our children is healthier,",UNGD
USA,1993,safer and more abundant than the one we inhabit today. I,UNGD
USA,1993,believe - I know - that together we can extend this moment,UNGD
USA,1993,of miracles into an age of great works and new wonders.,UNGD
USA,1994,"Let me first congratulate you, Mr.",UNGD
USA,1994,"President, on your election as President of the General",UNGD
USA,1994,Assembly for its forty-ninth session. The American people,UNGD
USA,1994,look forward to working with you to celebrate the United,UNGD

USA,1994,We meet today at a time of great hope and change.,UNGD
USA,1994,"The end of the cold war, the explosion of technology and",UNGD
USA,1994,trade and enterprise have given people the world over new,UNGD
USA,1994,opportunities to live up to their dreams and their God-given,UNGD
USA,1994,"potential. This is an age of hope -yet in this new world,",UNGD
USA,1994,we face a contest as old as history.,UNGD
USA,1994,It is a struggle between freedom and tyranny; between,UNGD
USA,1994,tolerance and bigotry; between knowledge and ignorance;,UNGD
USA,1994,between openness and isolation. It is a fight between those,UNGD
USA,1994,who would build free societies governed by laws and,UNGD
USA,1994,those who would impose their will by force.,UNGD
USA,1994,"Our struggle today - in a world more high-tech,",UNGD
USA,1994,"more fast-moving, more chaotically diverse than ever - is",UNGD
USA,1994,the age-old fight between hope and fear.,UNGD
USA,1994,Three times in this century - from the trenches of the,UNGD
USA,1994,Somme to the island of Iwo Jima to the shattered Wall in,UNGD
USA,1994,Berlin - the forces of hope were victorious. But the,UNGD
USA,1994,victors of the First World War squandered their triumph,UNGD
USA,1994,"when they turned inward, bringing on a global depression,",UNGD
USA,1994,and allowing fascism to rise and reignite global war.,UNGD
USA,1994,"After the Second World War, the Allies learned the",UNGD
USA,1994,lesson of the past. In the face of a new totalitarian threat,UNGD
USA,1994,"and the nuclear menace, great nations did not walk away",UNGD
USA,1994,from the challenge of the moment. Instead they chose to,UNGD
USA,1994,"reach out, to rebuild and to lead. They chose to create the",UNGD
USA,1994,"United Nations and they left us a world stronger, safer",UNGD
USA,1994,and freer.,UNGD
USA,1994,Our generation has a difficult task: the cold war is,UNGD
USA,1994,over. We must secure the peace. It falls to us to avoid,UNGD
USA,1994,the complacency that followed the First World War -,UNGD
USA,1994,without the spur of the imminent threat to our security,UNGD
USA,1994,that followed the Second World War.,UNGD
USA,1994,We must ensure that those who fought and found the,UNGD
USA,1994,courage to end the cold war - those from both East and,UNGD
USA,1994,West who loved freedom - did not labour in vain. Our,UNGD
USA,1994,sacred mission is to build a new world for our children -,UNGD
USA,1994,"more democratic, more prosperous, more free of ancient",UNGD
USA,1994,hatreds and modern means of destruction.,UNGD
USA,1994,That is no easy challenge; but we accept it with,UNGD
USA,1994,"confidence. After all, the walls that once divided nations",UNGD
USA,1994,in this very Hall have come down. More nations have,UNGD
USA,1994,chosen democracy than ever before. More have chosen,UNGD
USA,1994,free markets and economic justice. More have embraced,UNGD
USA,1994,the values of tolerance and liberty and civil society that,UNGD
USA,1994,allow us all to make the most of our lives.,UNGD

USA,1994,"are ascendant, they are surely not the whole story.",UNGD
USA,1994,"Terrible examples of chaos, repression and tyranny also",UNGD
USA,1994,mark our times. The twentieth century has proved that,UNGD

USA,1994,the ethnic conflicts that drive millions from their homes;,UNGD
USA,1994,the despots ready to repress their own people or conquer,UNGD
USA,1994,their neighbours; the proliferation of weapons of mass,UNGD
USA,1994,destruction; the terrorists wielding their deadly arms; the,UNGD
USA,1994,"criminal syndicates selling those arms, or drugs, infiltrating",UNGD
USA,1994,the very institutions of fragile democracies; a global,UNGD
USA,1994,"economy that offers great promise but also deep insecurity,",UNGD
USA,1994,and in many places declining opportunity; diseases like,UNGD

USA,1994,"around the world; and, finally, within many of our nations,",UNGD
USA,1994,"high rates of drug abuse and crime and family breakdown,",UNGD

USA,1994,"be active in different situations in different ways, but their",UNGD
USA,1994,purposes must be consistent with freedom and their,UNGD

USA,1994,"Of course, the first duty of every Member of the",UNGD

USA,1994,sharing the burdens lessens everyone’s load. We have no,UNGD
USA,1994,"desire to be the world’s policeman, but we will do what we",UNGD
USA,1994,can to help civil societies emerge from the ashes of,UNGD
USA,1994,"repression, to sustain fragile democracies, to add more free",UNGD

USA,1994,"and Latin America, and now to a small island in the",UNGD
USA,1994,"Caribbean, ordinary citizens are striving to build their",UNGD
USA,1994,own future. Promoting their cause is our generation’s,UNGD
USA,1994,"great opportunity, and we must do it together. A",UNGD
USA,1994,coalition for democracy is good for America.,UNGD
USA,1994,"Democracies, after all, are more likely to be stable, less",UNGD

USA,1994,"our friend, and not our enemy. In my nation, as in all of",UNGD
USA,1994,"your nations, there are many people who are",UNGD
USA,1994,understandably reluctant to undertake these efforts,UNGD
USA,1994,because often the distances are great or the cultures are,UNGD
USA,1994,different. There are good reasons for the caution that,UNGD
USA,1994,"people feel. Often, the chances of success or its costs are",UNGD
USA,1994,"unclear. And, of course, in every common endeavour",UNGD
USA,1994,there is always the potential for failure and often the risk,UNGD
USA,1994,of loss of life.,UNGD
USA,1994,And yet our people - as we have seen in the,UNGD
USA,1994,remarkable global response to the terrible crisis in,UNGD
USA,1994,Rwanda - genuinely want to help their neighbours around,UNGD
USA,1994,the world and to make some effort in our common cause.,UNGD
USA,1994,We have seen that progress can be made as well. The,UNGD
USA,1994,problem is deciding when we must respond and how we,UNGD
USA,1994,shall overcome our reluctance. This will never be easy.,UNGD
USA,1994,There are no simple formulas. All of us will make these,UNGD
USA,1994,decisions in part based on the distance of the problem,UNGD
USA,1994,"from our shores, the interests of our nation, the difference",UNGD
USA,1994,"we think we can make, the costs required, or the threat to",UNGD
USA,1994,our own citizens in the endeavour.,UNGD
USA,1994,"Hard questions will remain, and cannot be erased by",UNGD
USA,1994,some simple formula. But we should have the confidence,UNGD
USA,1994,"that these efforts can succeed, whether they are efforts to",UNGD
USA,1994,"keep people alive in the face of terrible tragedy, as in",UNGD
USA,1994,"Rwanda, or our efforts to avert a tragedy, as in the Horn",UNGD
USA,1994,"of Africa, or our efforts to support processes that are",UNGD
USA,1994,literally changing the future of millions. History is on,UNGD
USA,1994,our side. We should have confidence about this. Look,UNGD
USA,1994,at the march of freedom we have seen in the last year,UNGD
USA,1994,"alone. Who, a decade ago, would have dared predict the",UNGD
USA,1994,"startling changes in South Africa, in the Middle East and",UNGD
USA,1994,in Ireland; the stunning triumph of democracy and,UNGD
USA,1994,majority rule and the redemption of the purpose of Nelson,UNGD
USA,1994,7,UNGD
USA,1994,,UNGD
USA,1994,,UNGD
USA,1994,Mandela’s life; the brave efforts of Israel and its Arab,UNGD
USA,1994,neighbours to build bridges of peace between their peoples;,UNGD
USA,1994,the earnest search by the people of Northern Ireland and,UNGD
USA,1994,Great Britain and Ireland to end centuries of division and,UNGD
USA,1994,"decades of terror? In each case, credit belongs to those",UNGD
USA,1994,nations’ leaders and their courageous people. But in each,UNGD
USA,1994,instance the United States and other nations were privileged,UNGD
USA,1994,to help in these causes.,UNGD
USA,1994,The growth of cooperation between the United States,UNGD
USA,1994,and the Russian Federation also should give us all great,UNGD
USA,1994,cause for confidence. This is a partnership that is rooted in,UNGD
USA,1994,"democracy, a partnership that is working, a partnership of,",UNGD
USA,1994,"not complete agreement, but genuine mutual respect. After",UNGD
USA,1994,"so many years of nuclear terror, our two nations are taking",UNGD
USA,1994,dramatic steps to ease tensions around the world. For the,UNGD
USA,1994,"first time since the Second World War, foreign troops do",UNGD
USA,1994,not occupy the nations of Central and Eastern Europe. The,UNGD
USA,1994,Baltic nations are free. Russian and American missiles no,UNGD
USA,1994,longer target each other’s people. Three of the four nuclear,UNGD
USA,1994,members of the former Soviet Union have agreed to,UNGD
USA,1994,remove all nuclear weapons from their soil. And we are,UNGD
USA,1994,working on agreements to halt production of fissile,UNGD
USA,1994,materials for nuclear explosives; to make dismantling of,UNGD
USA,1994,nuclear warheads transparent and irreversible; and further,UNGD
USA,1994,to reduce our nuclear weapons and delivery vehicles.,UNGD
USA,1994,The United States and Russia also recognize that we,UNGD
USA,1994,must cooperate to control the emerging danger of terrorists,UNGD
USA,1994,who traffic in nuclear materials. To secure nuclear,UNGD
USA,1994,"materials at their sources, we have agreed with Russia to",UNGD
USA,1994,stop plutonium production by the year 2000; to construct a,UNGD
USA,1994,storage facility for fissile materials and buy up stocks of,UNGD
USA,1994,weapons-grade fuel; and to combat the criminals who are,UNGD
USA,1994,trying to smuggle materials for nuclear explosives. Our,UNGD
USA,1994,two nations and Germany have increased cooperation and,UNGD
USA,1994,"engaged in joint anti-terrorist training. Soon, under the",UNGD
USA,1994,"leadership of our Federal Bureau of Investigation, we will",UNGD
USA,1994,"open a law enforcement training academy in Europe, where",UNGD
USA,1994,police will learn how to combat more effectively trafficking,UNGD
USA,1994,"of nuclear weapons components, as well as the drug trade,",UNGD
USA,1994,organized crime and money laundering.,UNGD
USA,1994,The United States will also advance a wide-ranging,UNGD
USA,1994,non-proliferation agenda: a global convention to halt,UNGD
USA,1994,production of fissile materials; efforts to curb North,UNGD
USA,1994,Korea’s nuclear ambitions; transparent procedures for,UNGD
USA,1994,dismantling nuclear warheads; and our work to ban testing,UNGD
USA,1994,and to extend the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of,UNGD
USA,1994,Nuclear Weapons. And today I am proposing a first step,UNGD
USA,1994,toward the eventual elimination of a less visible but still,UNGD
USA,1994,deadly threat: the world’s 85 million anti-personnel land-,UNGD
USA,1994,mines - one for every 50 persons on the face of the earth.,UNGD
USA,1994,I ask all nations concerned to join with us and conclude,UNGD
USA,1994,an agreement to reduce the number and availability of,UNGD
USA,1994,those mines. Ridding the world of those often hidden,UNGD
USA,1994,weapons will help to save the lives of tens of thousands,UNGD
USA,1994,"of men, women and innocent children in the years to",UNGD
USA,1994,come.,UNGD
USA,1994,Our progress in the last year also provides,UNGD
USA,1994,confidence that in the post-cold-war years we can adapt,UNGD
USA,1994,and construct global institutions that will help to provide,UNGD
USA,1994,security and increase economic growth throughout the,UNGD
USA,1994,"world. Since I spoke here last year, 22 nations have",UNGD
USA,1994,joined the Partnership for Peace of the North Atlantic,UNGD
USA,1994,Treaty Organization (NATO). The first joint exercises,UNGD
USA,1994,"have been conducted, helping to give Europe the chance",UNGD
USA,1994,to become a more unified continent in which democratic,UNGD
USA,1994,"nations live within secure borders. In Asia, security talks",UNGD
USA,1994,and economic cooperation will lead to further stability.,UNGD
USA,1994,By reducing nations’ fears about their borders and,UNGD
USA,1994,"allowing them to spend less on military defences, our",UNGD
USA,1994,coalition for democracy can give nations in transition a,UNGD
USA,1994,better chance to offer new freedoms and opportunities to,UNGD
USA,1994,their own people. It is time that we think anew about the,UNGD
USA,1994,"structures of this global economy as well, tearing down",UNGD
USA,1994,walls that separate nations instead of hiding behind them.,UNGD
USA,1994,At the Group of Seven meeting at Naples this year,UNGD
USA,1994,"we committed ourselves to this task of renewal, to re-",UNGD
USA,1994,examining the economic institutions that have served us,UNGD
USA,1994,"so well in the past. In the interests of shared prosperity,",UNGD
USA,1994,the United States actively promotes open markets.,UNGD
USA,1994,"Though still in its infancy, the North American Free",UNGD
USA,1994,Trade Agreement has dramatically increased trade,UNGD
USA,1994,between the United States and Mexico and has produced,UNGD
USA,1994,"in the United States alone an estimated 200,000 new jobs.",UNGD
USA,1994,It offers a model to nations throughout the Americas,UNGD
USA,1994,which we hope to build on. And this week I will send,UNGD
USA,1994,legislation to the Congress to implement the General,UNGD
USA,1994,"Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the largest",UNGD
USA,1994,trade agreement in all of history. GATT - and its,UNGD
USA,1994,"successor, the World Trade Organization - holds the",UNGD
USA,1994,"promise for all of us of increased exports, higher wages",UNGD
USA,1994,and improved living standards. In the months and years,UNGD
USA,1994,to come we will work no less to extend the reach of open,UNGD
USA,1994,"markets, starting with the Asia-Pacific Economic",UNGD
USA,1994,Cooperation Council and the Summit of the Americas,UNGD
USA,1994,later this year.,UNGD
USA,1994,Here at the United Nations we must develop a,UNGD
USA,1994,concrete plan to meet the challenges of the next 50 years,UNGD
USA,1994,even as we celebrate the last 50 years. I believe we,UNGD
USA,1994,8,UNGD
USA,1994,,UNGD
USA,1994,,UNGD
USA,1994,should declare next year’s fiftieth anniversary not just a,UNGD
USA,1994,year of celebration but a year of renewal. We call on the,UNGD
USA,1994,Secretary-General to name a working group so that by the,UNGD
USA,1994,time we meet next year we will have a concrete action plan,UNGD
USA,1994,to revitalize the obligations of the United Nations to address,UNGD
USA,1994,"the security, economic and political challenges ahead -",UNGD
USA,1994,obligations we must all be willing to assume.,UNGD
USA,1994,"Our objectives should include ready, efficient and",UNGD
USA,1994,"capable United Nations peace-keeping forces, and I am",UNGD
USA,1994,"happy to report that, as I pledged last year and thanks to",UNGD
USA,1994,"support in the United States Congress, $1.2 billion is now",UNGD
USA,1994,available from the United States for this critical account.,UNGD
USA,1994,We must also pledge to keep United Nations reform,UNGD
USA,1994,"moving forward so that we do more with less, and we must",UNGD
USA,1994,improve our ability to respond to urgent needs. Let me,UNGD
USA,1994,suggest that it is time for the members of the Assembly to,UNGD
USA,1994,consider seriously President Menem’s suggestion for the,UNGD
USA,1994,creation of a civilian rapid-response capability for,UNGD
USA,1994,humanitarian crises.,UNGD
USA,1994,And let us not lose sight of the special role that,UNGD
USA,1994,development and democracy can play in preventing,UNGD
USA,1994,conflicts once peace has been established. Never before,UNGD
USA,1994,has the United Nations been in a better position to achieve,UNGD
USA,1994,the democratic goals of our founders. The end of the cold,UNGD
USA,1994,war has freed us from decades of paralysing divisions. And,UNGD
USA,1994,we all know that multilateral cooperation is not only,UNGD
USA,1994,necessary to address the new threats we face but possible,UNGD
USA,1994,to succeed.,UNGD
USA,1994,The efforts we have undertaken together in Haiti are,UNGD
USA,1994,a prime example. Under the sponsorship of the United,UNGD
USA,1994,"Nations, American troops, now being joined by the",UNGD
USA,1994,personnel of an ever-growing international coalition of over,UNGD
USA,1994,"two dozen nations, are giving the people of Haiti their",UNGD
USA,1994,"chance at freedom. Creative diplomacy, the influence of",UNGD
USA,1994,economic power and the credible threat of military force -,UNGD
USA,1994,all have contributed to this moment of opportunity.,UNGD
USA,1994,Essential civil order will be restored. Human rights,UNGD
USA,1994,violations will be curbed. The first refugees will be,UNGD
USA,1994,"returning within hours, on this day. The military leaders",UNGD
USA,1994,will step down. The democratic Government will be,UNGD
USA,1994,restored. President Aristide will return. The multinational,UNGD
USA,1994,mission will turn its responsibilities over to the United,UNGD
USA,1994,"Nations mission, which will remain in Haiti throughout",UNGD
USA,1994,"1995, until a new president is elected. During this time a",UNGD
USA,1994,multinational development effort will make available more,UNGD
USA,1994,than $1 billion to begin helping the Haitians rebuild their,UNGD
USA,1994,"country. In the spirit of reconciliation and reconstruction,",UNGD
USA,1994,President Aristide yesterday called for the immediate easing,UNGD
USA,1994,of sanctions so that the work of rebuilding can begin,UNGD
USA,1994,"immediately. Accordingly, I intend to act expeditiously,",UNGD
USA,1994,within Security Council resolutions 917 (1994) and 940,UNGD
USA,1994,"(1994) to enable us to restore health care, water and",UNGD
USA,1994,"electrical services, construction materials for humanitarian",UNGD
USA,1994,"efforts, and communications, agricultural and educational",UNGD
USA,1994,materials.,UNGD
USA,1994,Today I am also announcing that the United States,UNGD
USA,1994,will suspend all unilateral sanctions against Haiti except,UNGD
USA,1994,those that affect the military leaders and their immediate,UNGD
USA,1994,supporters. This will include regularly scheduled air,UNGD
USA,1994,"flights when the airport becomes available, financial",UNGD
USA,1994,transactions and travel restrictions. I urge all other,UNGD
USA,1994,nations to do the same.,UNGD
USA,1994,"In Haiti, the United States has demonstrated that it",UNGD
USA,1994,would lead a multinational force when our interests are,UNGD
USA,1994,"plain, when the cause is right, when the mission is",UNGD
USA,1994,achievable and the nations of the world stand with us.,UNGD
USA,1994,But Haiti’s people will have to muster the strength and,UNGD
USA,1994,the patience to travel the road of freedom. They have to,UNGD
USA,1994,do this for themselves. Every new democratic nation is,UNGD
USA,1994,fragile. But we will see the day when the people of Haiti,UNGD
USA,1994,fulfil their aspirations to liberty and when they are once,UNGD
USA,1994,again making genuine economic progress.,UNGD
USA,1994,"United Nations actions in Bosnia, like those in Haiti,",UNGD
USA,1994,demonstrate that progress can be made when a coalition,UNGD
USA,1994,backs up diplomacy with military power. For the first,UNGD
USA,1994,"time ever, NATO has taken, since we met last year,",UNGD
USA,1994,military actions beyond the territory of its members. The,UNGD
USA,1994,threat of NATO air power helped to establish the,UNGD
USA,1994,exclusion zone around Sarajevo and to end the Bosnian,UNGD
USA,1994,Serbs’ spring offensive against Gorazde. NATO’s,UNGD
USA,1994,"February ultimatum boosted our mediation efforts, which",UNGD
USA,1994,helped to end the war between the Bosnian Government,UNGD
USA,1994,and the Bosnian Croats and forged a federation between,UNGD
USA,1994,those two communities. To that extent the situation in,UNGD
USA,1994,"Bosnia has improved, but in recent weeks the situation",UNGD
USA,1994,"around Sarajevo has deteriorated substantially, and",UNGD
USA,1994,Sarajevo once again faces the prospect of strangulation.,UNGD
USA,1994,A new resolve by the United Nations to enforce its,UNGD
USA,1994,"resolutions is now necessary to save Sarajevo, and NATO",UNGD
USA,1994,stands ready to act.,UNGD
USA,1994,The situation in Bosnia is yet another reminder of,UNGD
USA,1994,the greatest irony of this century we are leaving. This,UNGD
USA,1994,"century, so full of hope and opportunity and achievement,",UNGD
USA,1994,has also been an age of deep destruction and despair. We,UNGD
USA,1994,cannot help but remember the millions who gave their,UNGD
USA,1994,lives during two world wars and the half century of,UNGD
USA,1994,9,UNGD
USA,1994,,UNGD
USA,1994,,UNGD
USA,1994,struggle by men and women in the East and West who,UNGD
USA,1994,ultimately prevailed in the name of freedom.,UNGD
USA,1994,But we must also think of our children and the world,UNGD
USA,1994,we will leave them in the twenty-first century. History has,UNGD
USA,1994,given us a very rare opportunity - the chance to build on,UNGD
USA,1994,the greatest legacy of this century without reliving its,UNGD
USA,1994,darkest moments. And we have shown that we can carry,UNGD
USA,1994,forward humanity’s ancient quest for freedom to build a,UNGD
USA,1994,world where democracy knows no borders but where,UNGD
USA,1994,"nations know their borders will always be secure, a world",UNGD
USA,1994,that gives all people the chance to realize their potential and,UNGD
USA,1994,to live out their dreams.,UNGD
USA,1995,It is,UNGD
USA,1995,a privilege to speak to the General Assembly today on,UNGD
USA,1995,behalf of the United States.,UNGD
USA,1995,A half-century ago the General Assembly first met,UNGD
USA,1995,"here in New York, across the river in a converted skating",UNGD
USA,1995,rink at Flushing Meadows. In those modest surroundings,UNGD
USA,1995,our predecessors began to put in place an ambitious,UNGD
USA,1995,framework that they hoped would keep the peace as,UNGD
USA,1995,successfully as they had prosecuted the war.,UNGD
USA,1995,"In the years since, the United Nations has helped",UNGD
USA,1995,"bring peace, prosperity and hope to countless people",UNGD
USA,1995,around the world. Technological change has brought,UNGD
USA,1995,nations closer together than the founders of the United,UNGD
USA,1995,9,UNGD
USA,1995,,UNGD
USA,1995,,UNGD
USA,1995,Nations could possibly have foreseen. The United Nations,UNGD
USA,1995,itself has been challenged in unforeseen ways. It has had to,UNGD
USA,1995,"manage complex humanitarian emergencies, from civil wars",UNGD
USA,1995,to mass movements of refugees to health epidemics. This,UNGD
USA,1995,evolution has placed great strains on the Organization and,UNGD
USA,1995,has revealed the necessity for far-reaching changes in how,UNGD
USA,1995,it is run.,UNGD
USA,1995,The Clinton Administration has vigorously made the,UNGD
USA,1995,case to our Congress and our people for continued,UNGD
USA,1995,American leadership at the United Nations. The United,UNGD
USA,1995,States made a commitment to the United Nations Charter,UNGD
USA,1995,"50 years ago, and we are determined to keep our",UNGD
USA,1995,"commitment, including our financial obligations.",UNGD
USA,1995,We will always remember that for millions of people,UNGD
USA,1995,"around the world, the United Nations is far from a faceless",UNGD
USA,1995,"institution. It is, as Harry Truman once said,",UNGD
USA,1995,"“a case of food, a box of school books; it is a doctor",UNGD
USA,1995,who vaccinates children; it is an expert who shows,UNGD
USA,1995,people how to raise more rice and more wheat.”,UNGD
USA,1995,"To millions more around the world, it is the difference",UNGD
USA,1995,between peace and war.,UNGD
USA,1995,"Economic and social development, as well as the",UNGD
USA,1995,"protection of human rights, remain central to the United",UNGD
USA,1995,Nations mission. But the United Nations must change to,UNGD
USA,1995,meet new needs more effectively. When money is wasted,UNGD
USA,1995,"in New York, Geneva or Vienna, when time is lost in",UNGD
USA,1995,"bureaucratic inertia, the people who pay the price are those",UNGD
USA,1995,"most vulnerable to famine, disease and violence.",UNGD
USA,1995,It is time to recognize that the United Nations must,UNGD
USA,1995,"direct its limited resources to the world’s highest priorities,",UNGD
USA,1995,focusing on the tasks that it performs the best. The United,UNGD
USA,1995,"Nations bureaucracy should be smaller, with a clear",UNGD
USA,1995,organizational structure and sharp lines of responsibility.,UNGD
USA,1995,Each programme must be held to a single simple standard:,UNGD
USA,1995,"it must make a tangible contribution to the freedom,",UNGD
USA,1995,security and well-being of real people in the real world.,UNGD
USA,1995,"In the last year, under the leadership of Secretary-",UNGD
USA,1995,"General Boutros-Ghali, the groundwork for substantial",UNGD
USA,1995,change has been laid. The United Nations has an office,UNGD
USA,1995,with the functions of an inspector general and a mandate to,UNGD
USA,1995,crack down on waste and fraud. Under-Secretary-General,UNGD
USA,1995,Joe Connor has embarked on an aggressive campaign to,UNGD
USA,1995,"improve the United Nations management culture, and we",UNGD
USA,1995,fully support his good work. The United Nations Secretariat,UNGD
USA,1995,has moved in the right direction by submitting a budget that,UNGD
USA,1995,"begins to restrain spending, and now this momentum for",UNGD
USA,1995,reform must accelerate.,UNGD
USA,1995,"Let me propose a brief, concrete agenda for reform.",UNGD
USA,1995,"First, we must end United Nations programmes that",UNGD
USA,1995,"have achieved their purpose, and we must consolidate",UNGD
USA,1995,"programmes that overlap, especially in the economic and",UNGD
USA,1995,social agencies. The United Nations has more than a,UNGD
USA,1995,"dozen organizations responsible for development,",UNGD
USA,1995,emergency response and statistical reporting. We should,UNGD
USA,1995,consider establishing a single agency for each of these,UNGD
USA,1995,functions. We should downsize the United Nations,UNGD
USA,1995,regional economic commissions. We should ensure that,UNGD
USA,1995,the functions of the United Nations Conference on Trade,UNGD
USA,1995,and Development do not duplicate those of the new,UNGD
USA,1995,"World Trade Organization (WTO), and we should adopt",UNGD
USA,1995,a moratorium on big United Nations conferences once the,UNGD
USA,1995,"present series is completed, concentrating instead on",UNGD
USA,1995,meeting the commitments of those conferences that we,UNGD
USA,1995,have already held.,UNGD
USA,1995,"Secondly, we need to streamline the United Nations",UNGD
USA,1995,"Secretariat to make it more efficient, accountable and",UNGD
USA,1995,transparent. Each part of the United Nations system,UNGD
USA,1995,should be subject to the scrutiny of an inspector general.,UNGD
USA,1995,The United Nations must not tolerate ethical or financial,UNGD
USA,1995,"abuses, and its managers should be appointed and",UNGD
USA,1995,promoted on the basis of merit.,UNGD
USA,1995,"Thirdly, we should rigorously scrutinize proposals",UNGD
USA,1995,"for new and extended peace-keeping missions, and we",UNGD
USA,1995,should improve the United Nations ability to respond,UNGD
USA,1995,rapidly when new missions are approved. We must agree,UNGD
USA,1995,on an equitable scale of peace-keeping assessments that,UNGD
USA,1995,reflects fully today’s economic realities. And we should,UNGD
USA,1995,have a unified budget for peace-keeping operations.,UNGD
USA,1995,"Finally, we must maintain the effectiveness of the",UNGD
USA,1995,Security Council. Germany and Japan should become,UNGD
USA,1995,"permanent members, and we should ensure that all the",UNGD
USA,1995,"world’s regions are fairly represented, without making the",UNGD
USA,1995,Council too large and unwieldy.,UNGD
USA,1995,We welcome the formation of the high-level group,UNGD
USA,1995,"on reform, initiated under the leadership of the outgoing",UNGD
USA,1995,"President of the General Assembly, Mr. Essy. Our goal",UNGD
USA,1995,must be that of a practical blueprint for United Nations,UNGD
USA,1995,reform and to ensure that it is adopted before the General,UNGD
USA,1995,Assembly finishes the work of its fiftieth session next,UNGD
USA,1995,fall. The way forward is clear; we have already seen and,UNGD
USA,1995,10,UNGD
USA,1995,,UNGD
USA,1995,,UNGD
USA,1995,studied countless studies and reports. Now the time has,UNGD
USA,1995,come to act on the best proposals.,UNGD
USA,1995,"As the Assembly knows, in my country there have",UNGD
USA,1995,been serious efforts to curtail our support for the United,UNGD
USA,1995,"Nations. The President and I, and our entire Administration,",UNGD
USA,1995,believe it would be reckless to turn away from an,UNGD
USA,1995,Organization that helps mobilize the support of other,UNGD
USA,1995,nations for goals that are consistent with American and,UNGD
USA,1995,global interests. But to sustain support for the United,UNGD
USA,1995,Nations among the American people and among the people,UNGD
USA,1995,"of other nations, it is not enough that we defend the",UNGD
USA,1995,institution. The best argument against retreat is further,UNGD
USA,1995,reform. Tangible progress in that direction will help us win,UNGD
USA,1995,the battle for United Nations support that we are waging in,UNGD
USA,1995,the United States.,UNGD
USA,1995,The United Nations must emerge from the reform,UNGD
USA,1995,"process better able to meet its fundamental goals, including",UNGD
USA,1995,the preservation of peace and security. From Korea to the,UNGD
USA,1995,"Persian Gulf to Haiti, the United Nations has provided a",UNGD
USA,1995,mandate to its Members as they carried out their,UNGD
USA,1995,responsibilities. The United Nations own Blue Helmets,UNGD
USA,1995,have helped nations create the basic conditions of peace in,UNGD
USA,1995,some of the most difficult situations imaginable around the,UNGD
USA,1995,"world, even though they have not always achieved their",UNGD
USA,1995,intended purpose.,UNGD
USA,1995,"Recently, a young Haitian father was asked what the",UNGD
USA,1995,peace-keeping forces had achieved in his country. He,UNGD
USA,1995,"answered,",UNGD
USA,1995,“We walk freely. We sleep quietly. There are no,UNGD
USA,1995,men who come for us in the night.”,UNGD
USA,1995,"In Haiti, as, for example, in Cambodia, Mozambique and El",UNGD
USA,1995,"Salvador, the United Nations has shown that peace-keeping,",UNGD
USA,1995,"despite its limitations, has been an enormously useful",UNGD
USA,1995,instrument.,UNGD
USA,1995,One region where United Nations forces and the,UNGD
USA,1995,international community have played a critical role is the,UNGD
USA,1995,Middle East. Another historic milestone will be marked this,UNGD
USA,1995,"Thursday, in Washington, when Israel and the Palestinians",UNGD
USA,1995,sign their agreement to implement phase two of the,UNGD
USA,1995,Declaration of Principles. That agreement will bring to life,UNGD
USA,1995,a goal first set many years ago in the Camp David accords:,UNGD
USA,1995,to protect Israel’s security and to give Palestinians,UNGD
USA,1995,throughout the West Bank control over their daily lives.,UNGD
USA,1995,The international community and the United Nations must,UNGD
USA,1995,"continue to support this process, both diplomatically and",UNGD
USA,1995,economically.,UNGD
USA,1995,There is no question that the United Nations has,UNGD
USA,1995,never undertaken a mission more difficult than the one in,UNGD
USA,1995,the former Yugoslavia. The limitations of that mission are,UNGD
USA,1995,"all too well known, but we all must recognize that it has",UNGD
USA,1995,provided relief for hundreds of thousands of people and,UNGD
USA,1995,"has saved literally thousands of lives. Today, diplomacy",UNGD
USA,1995,backed by force has given the United States and the,UNGD
USA,1995,international community an opportunity to move forward,UNGD
USA,1995,on a track that is producing genuinely hopeful results. The,UNGD
USA,1995,United Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty,UNGD
USA,1995,Organization (NATO) are working effectively together to,UNGD
USA,1995,try to bring peace to the region. On 8 September in,UNGD
USA,1995,"Geneva, the parties to the conflict accepted the",UNGD
USA,1995,fundamental goal that the Security Council has often,UNGD
USA,1995,expressed: the continuation of the Republic of Bosnia and,UNGD
USA,1995,Herzegovina as a single State within its internationally,UNGD
USA,1995,recognized borders. I will be meeting with the Foreign,UNGD
USA,1995,"Ministers of Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia later today, and",UNGD
USA,1995,at that time I will urge them — implore them — to,UNGD
USA,1995,maintain the momentum towards peace and to establish,UNGD
USA,1995,constitutional structures for Bosnia.,UNGD
USA,1995,The framers of the Charter of the United Nations,UNGD
USA,1995,created this institution to meet threats to peace and,UNGD
USA,1995,security posed by aggression and armed conflict. Those,UNGD
USA,1995,"threats are still, unfortunately, very much with us. But",UNGD
USA,1995,"today, the world also faces a new set of security",UNGD
USA,1995,"challenges, including proliferation, terrorism, international",UNGD
USA,1995,"crime and narcotics, as well as the far-reaching",UNGD
USA,1995,consequences of damage to the environment. These have,UNGD
USA,1995,assumed a new and dangerous scope in a more,UNGD
USA,1995,interdependent world. As President Clinton said in San,UNGD
USA,1995,"Francisco in June, the",UNGD
USA,1995,“new forces of integration carry within them the,UNGD
USA,1995,seeds of disintegration and destruction”.,UNGD
USA,1995,"While, as I said earlier, new technologies have",UNGD
USA,1995,"brought us closer together, they also have made it easier",UNGD
USA,1995,"for terrorists, drug dealers and other international",UNGD
USA,1995,"criminals to acquire weapons of mass destruction, to set",UNGD
USA,1995,up cocaine cartels and to hide their ill-gotten gains. The,UNGD
USA,1995,"collapse of communism has shattered dictatorships, to be",UNGD
USA,1995,"sure, but it has also left the political and legal institutions",UNGD
USA,1995,of newly liberated nations even more vulnerable to those,UNGD
USA,1995,who seek to subvert them.,UNGD
USA,1995,Although these threats are sometimes sponsored by,UNGD
USA,1995,"States, they increasingly follow no flag. Each of us must",UNGD
USA,1995,"vigorously fight these enemies on our own, but we will",UNGD
USA,1995,never be truly secure until we effectively fight them,UNGD
USA,1995,together. That is the new security challenge for the global,UNGD
USA,1995,11,UNGD
USA,1995,,UNGD
USA,1995,,UNGD
USA,1995,"community, and it must be the new security mission for the",UNGD
USA,1995,United Nations.,UNGD
USA,1995,There is no single area in which the United Nations,UNGD
USA,1995,can make a more significant contribution than in that of,UNGD
USA,1995,"non-proliferation. Fifty years ago, the United States was the",UNGD
USA,1995,only country capable of making a nuclear bomb. Today,UNGD
USA,1995,many countries have the technology that would enable them,UNGD
USA,1995,to turn a fist-sized chunk of plutonium into a bomb as,UNGD
USA,1995,small as a suitcase. That is one reason why more than 170,UNGD
USA,1995,"nations agreed, at a conference held here last May and",UNGD
USA,1995,"effectively chaired by Ambassador Dhanapala, to extend for",UNGD
USA,1995,all time the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear,UNGD
USA,1995,Weapons. That is an achievement we must rejoice in but,UNGD
USA,1995,also build on.,UNGD
USA,1995,I should like to outline some steps in the field of,UNGD
USA,1995,"non-proliferation. First, we should have a comprehensive",UNGD
USA,1995,test-ban treaty ready for signature by the time we meet here,UNGD
USA,1995,next September. As President Clinton announced last,UNGD
USA,1995,"month, the United States is committed to a true zero-yield",UNGD
USA,1995,test ban. We urge other nations to join us in that,UNGD
USA,1995,commitment.,UNGD
USA,1995,"Secondly, we should immediately start negotiations on",UNGD
USA,1995,a fissile material cut-off treaty. Those who have been most,UNGD
USA,1995,vocal in calling for nuclear disarmament should recognize,UNGD
USA,1995,that it is essential to ban future production of fissile,UNGD
USA,1995,material for nuclear weapons.,UNGD
USA,1995,"Thirdly, we should push forward with the historic",UNGD
USA,1995,reductions of the nuclear arsenals of the United States and,UNGD
USA,1995,countries of the former Soviet Union. I call on the United,UNGD
USA,1995,"States Senate, as well as on the Russian Duma, to approve",UNGD
USA,1995,the treaty on further reduction and limitation of strategic,UNGD
USA,1995,offensive arms (START II) so that we can lock in deep cuts,UNGD
USA,1995,"in our strategic nuclear arsenals. In addition, Presidents",UNGD
USA,1995,Clinton and Yeltsin are working together to ensure the,UNGD
USA,1995,"safety, transparency and irreversibility of nuclear-arms",UNGD
USA,1995,reductions.,UNGD
USA,1995,"As part of this process, President Yeltsin will host a",UNGD
USA,1995,nuclear safety and security summit in Moscow next spring.,UNGD
USA,1995,"This summit should have a very ambitious agenda,",UNGD
USA,1995,including a declaration of principles on nuclear safety. We,UNGD
USA,1995,look to this summit to address the worldwide problems of,UNGD
USA,1995,"nuclear-waste management, including those of ocean",UNGD
USA,1995,dumping. The summit should also promote a plan of action,UNGD
USA,1995,"to safeguard nuclear materials, a plan that should include",UNGD
USA,1995,new measures to prevent criminals and terrorists from,UNGD
USA,1995,acquiring nuclear materials for use in weapons.,UNGD
USA,1995,"Finally, we should push for the earliest possible",UNGD
USA,1995,entry into force of the Chemical Weapons Convention.,UNGD
USA,1995,President Clinton has urged the United States Senate to,UNGD
USA,1995,"act promptly on its ratification, and to stop holding the",UNGD
USA,1995,START II Treaty and the Chemical Weapons Convention,UNGD
USA,1995,hostage to unrelated issues. The world has witnessed the,UNGD
USA,1995,effects of poison gas too many times in this century — on,UNGD
USA,1995,"European battlefields during the First World War, in",UNGD
USA,1995,"Ethiopia and Manchuria during the 1930s, and against",UNGD
USA,1995,Iranian soldiers and innocent Kurdish civilians in the,UNGD
USA,1995,1980s. The Chemical Weapons Convention will make,UNGD
USA,1995,"every nation safer, and we need it now.",UNGD
USA,1995,The United Nations is also playing an invaluable,UNGD
USA,1995,role in focusing attention on pressing regional,UNGD
USA,1995,"proliferation problems. In Iraq, the United Nations Special",UNGD
USA,1995,"Commission (UNSCOM) and its Chairman, Rolf Ekeus,",UNGD
USA,1995,continue to uncover horrific details about Saddam,UNGD
USA,1995,Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction.,UNGD
USA,1995,"Under Saddam Hussein, Iraq developed a deadly",UNGD
USA,1995,biological-weapons capacity hidden from view. It was,UNGD
USA,1995,conducting research to turn some of the most toxic,UNGD
USA,1995,substances known to man into weapons of war. We know,UNGD
USA,1995,that Saddam succeeded in putting anthrax and botulism in,UNGD
USA,1995,"bombs and missile warheads. In December 1990, he",UNGD
USA,1995,"deployed these weapons, with every intention of using",UNGD
USA,1995,them against the international coalition and innocent,UNGD
USA,1995,civilians. He was dissuaded from doing so only by the,UNGD
USA,1995,steadfast determination of the United States and the,UNGD
USA,1995,international community.,UNGD
USA,1995,In the light of what Ambassador Ekeus has,UNGD
USA,1995,"uncovered in Iraq, we can conclude only that for the last",UNGD
USA,1995,"four and a half years, Saddam Hussein has lied about the",UNGD
USA,1995,full scope of Iraq’s weapons programmes. There should,UNGD
USA,1995,be no easing of the sanctions regime against Iraq until its,UNGD
USA,1995,Government complies with all the demands of the,UNGD
USA,1995,Security Council and clearly demonstrates that it has,UNGD
USA,1995,changed its ways.,UNGD
USA,1995,The United Nations should also promote,UNGD
USA,1995,responsibility and restraint in the transfer of conventional,UNGD
USA,1995,"weapons. At last year’s session of the General Assembly,",UNGD
USA,1995,"President Clinton proposed, and the Assembly approved,",UNGD
USA,1995,the eventual elimination of anti-personnel mines. On my,UNGD
USA,1995,"recent trip to Cambodia, I saw the terrible damage these",UNGD
USA,1995,"hidden killers can do. This year, we will again call on",UNGD
USA,1995,other countries to join us in putting an end to the export,UNGD
USA,1995,of land-mines.,UNGD
USA,1995,12,UNGD
USA,1995,,UNGD
USA,1995,,UNGD
USA,1995,"Two years ago, President Clinton called on the",UNGD
USA,1995,international community to devise a true international,UNGD
USA,1995,system governing the transfer of conventional weapons and,UNGD
USA,1995,sensitive dual-use technologies. I am pleased that the,UNGD
USA,1995,Russian Federation has joined with the United States and 26,UNGD
USA,1995,other countries to agree on a common principle to control,UNGD
USA,1995,the build-up of dangerous conventional arms. We hope to,UNGD
USA,1995,"activate this global regime, which is called the New Forum,",UNGD
USA,1995,by the end of this year.,UNGD
USA,1995,The proliferation of weapons worldwide has added a,UNGD
USA,1995,disturbing dimension to another threat we all face: the,UNGD
USA,1995,"threat of international terrorism. Indeed, this year’s sarin",UNGD
USA,1995,gas attack in Tokyo is a grim warning of what can happen,UNGD
USA,1995,when terrorists acquire weapons of mass destruction.,UNGD
USA,1995,More nations are joining the fight against those,UNGD
USA,1995,individuals and groups that attack civilians for political,UNGD
USA,1995,ends. The United Nations has supported this effort in,UNGD
USA,1995,important ways. The Security Council recognized the,UNGD
USA,1995,importance of countering State-sponsored terrorism by,UNGD
USA,1995,imposing sanctions against Libya for the bombing of Pan,UNGD
USA,1995,Am 103 and UTA 772.,UNGD
USA,1995,Terrorists must be treated as criminals and there must,UNGD
USA,1995,be no place where they can hide from the consequences of,UNGD
USA,1995,their acts. States that sponsor terrorists should feel the full,UNGD
USA,1995,weight of sanctions that can be imposed by the international,UNGD
USA,1995,community. Let us not deceive ourselves: every dollar that,UNGD
USA,1995,goes into the Government coffers of a State-sponsor of,UNGD
USA,1995,terrorism such as Iran helps pay for a terrorist’s bullets or,UNGD
USA,1995,bombs. Iran’s role as the foremost State-sponsor of,UNGD
USA,1995,terrorism makes its secret quest for weapons of mass,UNGD
USA,1995,destruction even more alarming. We must stand together to,UNGD
USA,1995,prevent Iran from acquiring such threatening capabilities.,UNGD
USA,1995,The United States has taken a leading role in meeting,UNGD
USA,1995,the international terrorist threat. We have intensified our,UNGD
USA,1995,sanctions against Iran. Last January President Clinton issued,UNGD
USA,1995,an Executive Order prohibiting financial transactions with,UNGD
USA,1995,terrorist groups and individuals that threaten the Middle,UNGD
USA,1995,East peace process. We are urging our Congress to tighten,UNGD
USA,1995,our immigration and criminal laws to keep terrorists on the,UNGD
USA,1995,run or put them behind bars.,UNGD
USA,1995,The United States strongly supports the counter-,UNGD
USA,1995,terrorism measures the G-7 and Russia announced at the,UNGD
USA,1995,"Halifax Summit, and we expect the G-8 Ministerial Meeting",UNGD
USA,1995,on Terrorism in Ottawa to produce a concrete-action plan,UNGD
USA,1995,to implement these measures that were adopted at the,UNGD
USA,1995,Halifax Summit.,UNGD
USA,1995,Other kinds of international crime also threaten the,UNGD
USA,1995,safety of our citizens and the fabric of our societies. And,UNGD
USA,1995,globalization brings new and frightening dimensions to,UNGD
USA,1995,crime. The threat of crime is a particular menace to,UNGD
USA,1995,"young democracies. It weakens confidence in institutions,",UNGD
USA,1995,preys on the most vulnerable in our societies and,UNGD
USA,1995,undermines free-market reform.,UNGD
USA,1995,"Of course, every country must take its own measures",UNGD
USA,1995,to combat these criminal threats. The Administration that,UNGD
USA,1995,I represent is now completing a review of our approach,UNGD
USA,1995,"to transnational crime, a review that will lead to a",UNGD
USA,1995,"stronger, more coordinated attack on this problem.",UNGD
USA,1995,"To help other States deal with criminal threats, the",UNGD
USA,1995,United States and Hungary have created the International,UNGD
USA,1995,Law Enforcement Academy in Budapest to train police,UNGD
USA,1995,officers and law-enforcement officials from Central,UNGD
USA,1995,Europe and the States of the former Soviet Union. We are,UNGD
USA,1995,"providing similar help bilaterally, and through the United",UNGD
USA,1995,"Nations International Drug Control Programme, to those",UNGD
USA,1995,countries whose laws are challenged by international drug,UNGD
USA,1995,cartels.,UNGD
USA,1995,A particularly insidious form of crime and corruption,UNGD
USA,1995,is money-laundering. All nations should work together to,UNGD
USA,1995,implement the recommendations of the Organization for,UNGD
USA,1995,Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to,UNGD
USA,1995,attack this insidious money-laundering. The nations of this,UNGD
USA,1995,hemisphere should also advance the anti-money-,UNGD
USA,1995,laundering initiative introduced at last December’s,UNGD
USA,1995,"Summit of the Americas. Together, we must work to",UNGD
USA,1995,squeeze the dirty money out of the global financial,UNGD
USA,1995,system.,UNGD
USA,1995,Through the United Nations conventions on drugs,UNGD
USA,1995,and crime the international community has set strong,UNGD
USA,1995,standards that we must now act to enforce. We call on,UNGD
USA,1995,Member States which have not already joined the 1988,UNGD
USA,1995,"drug Convention to do so promptly, and we call on those",UNGD
USA,1995,countries which have approved the Convention to move,UNGD
USA,1995,quickly to implement its important provisions.,UNGD
USA,1995,We are also increasingly aware that damage to the,UNGD
USA,1995,environment and unsustainable population growth threaten,UNGD
USA,1995,the security of our nations and the well-being of our,UNGD
USA,1995,"peoples. Their harmful effects are evident in famines,",UNGD
USA,1995,"infant mortality rates, refugee crises, and ozone depletion.",UNGD
USA,1995,"In places like Rwanda and Somalia, for example, they",UNGD
USA,1995,contribute to civil wars and emergencies that can be,UNGD
USA,1995,resolved only by extremely costly international,UNGD
USA,1995,intervention. We must carry out the commitments we,UNGD
USA,1995,13,UNGD
USA,1995,,UNGD
USA,1995,,UNGD
USA,1995,"made last year at the Cairo Conference, as well as the",UNGD
USA,1995,important commitments made at the Rio Conference three,UNGD
USA,1995,years ago.,UNGD
USA,1995,Never have our problems around the world been more,UNGD
USA,1995,complex. It has never been more evident that these,UNGD
USA,1995,"problems affect all nations, developed and developing alike.",UNGD
USA,1995,Only by working together can we effectively deal with the,UNGD
USA,1995,new threats we all face that I have outlined here today.,UNGD
USA,1995,That is why in this fiftieth anniversary year we must,UNGD
USA,1995,shape the United Nations agenda as if we were creating the,UNGD
USA,1995,institution anew. Just as the founders of the United Nations,UNGD
USA,1995,devised a new framework to deter aggression and armed,UNGD
USA,1995,"conflict, the United Nations, in particular the Security",UNGD
USA,1995,"Council, must now assign the same priority to combating",UNGD
USA,1995,"the threat posed by proliferation, by terrorism, by",UNGD
USA,1995,"international crime, by narcotics and by environmental",UNGD
USA,1995,pollution. We should dedicate our efforts in the United,UNGD
USA,1995,Nations and elsewhere to turning our global consensus,UNGD
USA,1995,against these threats into concrete and effective action. We,UNGD
USA,1995,"must renew and reform the United Nations not for its sake,",UNGD
USA,1995,but for our own.,UNGD
USA,1996,Three years ago I had the honour,UNGD
USA,1996,of being the first American President born after the,UNGD
USA,1996,founding of the United Nations to address the General,UNGD
USA,1996,"Assembly. In its fifty-first year, the United Nations has not",UNGD
USA,1996,yet realized all its founders’ aspirations. But the ideals of,UNGD
USA,1996,"the United Nations Charter — peace, freedom, tolerance",UNGD
USA,1996,and prosperity — now touch more people in more nations,UNGD
USA,1996,than ever before.,UNGD
USA,1996,Now we find ourselves at a turning point in history,UNGD
USA,1996,when the blocs and barriers that long defined the world are,UNGD
USA,1996,giving way to an age of remarkable possibility — a time,UNGD
USA,1996,when more of our children and more nations will be able to,UNGD
USA,1996,live out their dreams than ever before. But this is also an,UNGD
USA,1996,"age of new threats — threats from terrorists, from rogue",UNGD
USA,1996,"States that support them, threats from ethnic, religious,",UNGD
USA,1996,"racial and tribal hatreds, threats from international",UNGD
USA,1996,criminals and drug traffickers — all of whom will be,UNGD
USA,1996,more dangerous if they gain access to weapons of mass,UNGD
USA,1996,destruction.,UNGD
USA,1996,"The challenge before us, plainly, is twofold: to seize",UNGD
USA,1996,the new opportunities for more people to enjoy peace and,UNGD
USA,1996,"freedom, security and prosperity and to move strongly",UNGD
USA,1996,and swiftly against the dangers that change has produced.,UNGD
USA,1996,"This week and in this place, we take a giant step",UNGD
USA,1996,"forward. By overwhelming global consensus, we will",UNGD
USA,1996,make a solemn commitment to end all nuclear tests for all,UNGD
USA,1996,time.,UNGD
USA,1996,"Before entering this Hall, I had the great honour to",UNGD
USA,1996,be the first leader to sign the Comprehensive Test-Ban,UNGD
USA,1996,"Treaty (CTBT). I did so, with some pride, with this pen,",UNGD
USA,1996,for this pen is the very one that President Kennedy used,UNGD
USA,1996,to help bring the limited test-ban Treaty to life 33 years,UNGD
USA,1996,ago.,UNGD
USA,1996,This Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty will help,UNGD
USA,1996,prevent the nuclear Powers from developing more,UNGD
USA,1996,advanced and more dangerous weapons. It will limit the,UNGD
USA,1996,ability of other States to acquire such devices themselves.,UNGD
USA,1996,It points us towards a century in which the roles and risks,UNGD
USA,1996,of nuclear weapons can be further reduced and ultimately,UNGD
USA,1996,eliminated.,UNGD
USA,1996,I want to thank all those who helped bring us to this,UNGD
USA,1996,"day, especially the Chairman of the comprehensive test-",UNGD
USA,1996,,UNGD
USA,1996,,UNGD
USA,1996,"ban negotiating Committee, Netherlands Ambassador",UNGD
USA,1996,"Ramaker, and the Government of Australia, which took the",UNGD
USA,1996,lead at the United Nations.,UNGD
USA,1996,I thank the Secretary-General for the remarks he made,UNGD
USA,1996,this morning in establishing the criteria and standards in,UNGD
USA,1996,support of the United Nations as the depository of the,UNGD
USA,1996,Treaty.,UNGD
USA,1996,The signatures of the world’s declared nuclear,UNGD
USA,1996,"Powers — the United States, China, France, Russia and the",UNGD
USA,1996,United Kingdom — along with those of the vast majority,UNGD
USA,1996,"of its nations, will immediately create an international norm",UNGD
USA,1996,against nuclear testing even before the Treaty formally,UNGD
USA,1996,enters into force.,UNGD
USA,1996,The CTBT is the shared work of hard negotiation.,UNGD
USA,1996,Some have complained that it does not mandate total,UNGD
USA,1996,nuclear disarmament by a date certain. I would say to them:,UNGD
USA,1996,“Do not forsake the benefits of this achievement by,UNGD
USA,1996,ignoring the tremendous progress we have already made,UNGD
USA,1996,towards that goal.” Today there are no Russian missiles,UNGD
USA,1996,pointed at America and no American missiles pointed at,UNGD
USA,1996,Russia.,UNGD
USA,1996,Through the START Treaties we are cutting our,UNGD
USA,1996,"nuclear arsenals by two thirds. Ukraine, Belarus and",UNGD
USA,1996,Kazakstan are giving up the nuclear weapons left on their,UNGD
USA,1996,land after the Soviet Union dissolved.,UNGD
USA,1996,We are working with the newly independent States to,UNGD
USA,1996,improve security at nuclear facilities and to convert nuclear,UNGD
USA,1996,weapons to peaceful uses.,UNGD
USA,1996,The United States and other nuclear-weapon States,UNGD
USA,1996,have embraced the South Pacific and African nuclear-free,UNGD
USA,1996,zones. Now half the world’s land area is nuclear free by,UNGD
USA,1996,international agreement. And the world community,UNGD
USA,1996,extended indefinitely the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of,UNGD
USA,1996,Nuclear Weapons (NPT).,UNGD
USA,1996,Yet some of the very changes that had made this,UNGD
USA,1996,progress possible have also created new risks. The breakup,UNGD
USA,1996,of the Soviet Union left nuclear materials dispersed,UNGD
USA,1996,throughout the newly independent States. As barriers have,UNGD
USA,1996,come down around the world the danger of nuclear,UNGD
USA,1996,smuggling has gone up. So even as we reduce the global,UNGD
USA,1996,"stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction, we must also",UNGD
USA,1996,reduce the danger that lethal materials could wind up in the,UNGD
USA,1996,"wrong hands, while developing effective defences for our",UNGD
USA,1996,people if that should happen.,UNGD
USA,1996,The United States has six priority goals to further lift,UNGD
USA,1996,the threat of nuclear weapons destruction and the threat of,UNGD
USA,1996,"weapons of mass destruction, and to limit their dangerous",UNGD
USA,1996,spread.,UNGD
USA,1996,"First, we must protect our people from chemical",UNGD
USA,1996,attack and make it harder for rogue States and terrorists,UNGD
USA,1996,to brandish poison gas by bringing the chemical weapons,UNGD
USA,1996,Convention into force as soon as possible. I thank the,UNGD
USA,1996,nations here that have ratified the chemical weapons,UNGD
USA,1996,Convention. I deeply regret that the United States Senate,UNGD
USA,1996,"has not yet voted on the Convention, but I want to assure",UNGD
USA,1996,you and people throughout the world that I will not let,UNGD
USA,1996,"this treaty die, and we will join the ranks of nation",UNGD
USA,1996,determined to prevent the spread of chemical weapons.,UNGD
USA,1996,"Secondly, we must reduce the risk that an outlaw",UNGD
USA,1996,State or organization could build a nuclear device by,UNGD
USA,1996,negotiating a treaty to freeze the production of fissile,UNGD
USA,1996,materials for use in nuclear weapons. The Conference on,UNGD
USA,1996,Disarmament should take up this challenge immediately.,UNGD
USA,1996,"The United States, Russia, France and the United",UNGD
USA,1996,Kingdom already have halted production of fissile,UNGD
USA,1996,materials for weapons. I urge other nations to end the,UNGD
USA,1996,unsafeguarded production of these materials pending,UNGD
USA,1996,completion of the treaty.,UNGD
USA,1996,"Thirdly, we must continue to reduce our nuclear",UNGD
USA,1996,"arsenals. When Russia ratifies START II, President",UNGD
USA,1996,Yeltsin and I are all ready to discuss the possibilities of,UNGD
USA,1996,"further cuts, as well as limiting and monitoring nuclear",UNGD
USA,1996,warheads and materials. This will help make deep,UNGD
USA,1996,reductions irreversible.,UNGD
USA,1996,"Fourthly, we must reinforce our efforts against the",UNGD
USA,1996,spread of nuclear weapons by strengthening the Treaty on,UNGD
USA,1996,the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). We,UNGD
USA,1996,should give the International Atomic Energy Agency a,UNGD
USA,1996,stronger role and sharper tools for conducting worldwide,UNGD
USA,1996,inspections. Our law enforcement and customs officials,UNGD
USA,1996,should cooperate more in the fight against nuclear,UNGD
USA,1996,smuggling. And I urge all nations that have not signed the,UNGD
USA,1996,NPT to do so without delay.,UNGD
USA,1996,"Fifthly, we must better protect our people from those",UNGD
USA,1996,"who would use disease as a weapon of war, by giving the",UNGD
USA,1996,biological weapons Convention the means to strengthen,UNGD
USA,1996,"compliance, including on-site investigations when we",UNGD
USA,1996,believe such weapons may have been used or when,UNGD
USA,1996,suspicious outbreaks of disease occur. We should aim to,UNGD
USA,1996,complete this task by 1998.,UNGD
USA,1996,2,UNGD
USA,1996,,UNGD
USA,1996,"Finally, we must end the carnage caused by",UNGD
USA,1996,"anti-personnel landmines, the hidden killers that murder and",UNGD
USA,1996,"maim more than 25,000 people a year. In May, I announced",UNGD
USA,1996,a series of actions the United States would take towards,UNGD
USA,1996,"this goal. Today, I renew my appeal for the swift",UNGD
USA,1996,"negotiation of a worldwide ban on the use, stockpiling,",UNGD
USA,1996,"production, and transfer of anti-personnel landmines. Our",UNGD
USA,1996,children deserve to walk the Earth in safety.,UNGD
USA,1996,"Thirty-three years ago, at the height of the cold war,",UNGD
USA,1996,President Kennedy spoke at American University in,UNGD
USA,1996,"Washington. Peace was the topic of his address, but not an",UNGD
USA,1996,"abstract ideal of peace. Instead, he urged us to focus on",UNGD
USA,1996,"“a more practical, attainable peace — based not on a",UNGD
USA,1996,sudden revolution in human nature but on a gradual,UNGD
USA,1996,evolution in human institutions — on a series of,UNGD
USA,1996,concrete actions and effective agreements which are in,UNGD
USA,1996,the interests of all concerned.”,UNGD
USA,1996,It was in that same speech that he announced that talks,UNGD
USA,1996,would shortly begin in Moscow on a comprehensive test-,UNGD
USA,1996,ban treaty.,UNGD
USA,1996,President Kennedy’s vision exceeded the possibilities,UNGD
USA,1996,"of his time, but his words speak to us still. As we sign our",UNGD
USA,1996,names to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty —,UNGD
USA,1996,"the longest-sought, hardest-fought prize in arms control",UNGD
USA,1996,history — let us summon the confidence of earlier pioneers,UNGD
USA,1996,and set our sights on the challenges of the new century.,UNGD
USA,1996,Over the past three years we have moved in the right,UNGD
USA,1996,"direction in meeting those challenges. In Bosnia, where the",UNGD
USA,1996,war is over and where just 10 days ago its people went to,UNGD
USA,1996,"the polls in peace, we have moved in the right direction.",UNGD
USA,1996,"Now we must help Bosnia build a unified, democratic, and",UNGD
USA,1996,peaceful future.,UNGD
USA,1996,"In Haiti, where the dictators are gone, democracy is",UNGD
USA,1996,"back and the exodus of refugees has ended, we have move",UNGD
USA,1996,in the right direction. Now we must help the Haitian people,UNGD
USA,1996,seize the full benefits of freedom and forge a more,UNGD
USA,1996,prosperous future. In the Middle East and in Northern,UNGD
USA,1996,"Ireland, there is progress towards lasting peace, and we are",UNGD
USA,1996,moving in the right direction. Now we must support,UNGD
USA,1996,"continued progress between Israel and Palestinians, and we",UNGD
USA,1996,must broaden the circle of peace to include more of Israel’s,UNGD
USA,1996,neighbours. We must help to give the children of Belfast,UNGD
USA,1996,the chance to live out normal lives.,UNGD
USA,1996,"In the fact that democracy, open markets and peace",UNGD
USA,1996,"are taking hold around the world, we are moving in the",UNGD
USA,1996,"right direction. Here in the Americas, every nation but",UNGD
USA,1996,"one has raised freedom’s flag. In Central Europe, in",UNGD
USA,1996,"Russia, Ukraine and the other new independent States, the",UNGD
USA,1996,forces of reform have earned all our respect and will,UNGD
USA,1996,continue to have the support of the United States. Now,UNGD
USA,1996,we must begin to welcome Europe’s new democracies,UNGD
USA,1996,"into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),",UNGD
USA,1996,strengthen NATO’s partnership with Russia and build a,UNGD
USA,1996,secure and undivided Europe.,UNGD
USA,1996,"In Asia, South Korea, Japan, China and America",UNGD
USA,1996,working together persuaded North Korea to freeze its,UNGD
USA,1996,"nuclear programme under international monitoring. Now,",UNGD
USA,1996,"in the wake of provocative actions by North Korea, we",UNGD
USA,1996,must pursue a permanent peace for all the Korean people.,UNGD
USA,1996,Our planet is safer because of our common efforts to,UNGD
USA,1996,"close Chernobyl, to address the challenges of climate",UNGD
USA,1996,"change, to protect the world’s forests and oceans. Now",UNGD
USA,1996,we must uphold our duty as custodians of our,UNGD
USA,1996,environment so that our children will inherit an even,UNGD
USA,1996,healthier planet.,UNGD
USA,1996,All of us must continue our historic efforts to build,UNGD
USA,1996,"a better, more global trading system for the twenty-first",UNGD
USA,1996,"century. We have made remarkable progress, but there is",UNGD
USA,1996,"more to do in opening markets, in creating millions of",UNGD
USA,1996,new jobs for all our people.,UNGD
USA,1996,"In this time of challenge and change, the United",UNGD
USA,1996,"Nations is more important than ever before, because our",UNGD
USA,1996,world is more interdependent than ever before. Most,UNGD
USA,1996,"Americans know this. Unfortunately, some Americans, in",UNGD
USA,1996,"their longing to be free of the world’s problems, and",UNGD
USA,1996,"perhaps to focus more on our own problems, ignore what",UNGD
USA,1996,"the United Nations has done, ignore the benefits of",UNGD
USA,1996,cooperation. They ignore our own interdependence with,UNGD
USA,1996,all of you in charting a better future. They ignore all that,UNGD
USA,1996,the United Nations is doing to lift the lives of millions by,UNGD
USA,1996,"preserving the peace, vaccinating children, caring for",UNGD
USA,1996,"refugees, sharing the blessings of progress around the",UNGD
USA,1996,world. They have made it difficult for the United States,UNGD
USA,1996,to meet its obligations to the United Nations. But let me,UNGD
USA,1996,reassure all of you: the vast majority of Americans,UNGD
USA,1996,"support the United Nations, not only because it reflects",UNGD
USA,1996,"our own ideals, but because it reinforces our interests. We",UNGD
USA,1996,must continue to work to manifest the support that our,UNGD
USA,1996,"people feel. For the fifty-first year in a row, the United",UNGD
USA,1996,States will be the largest financial contributor to the,UNGD
USA,1996,"United Nations. We are paying our dues, and I am",UNGD
USA,1996,committed to paying off our accumulated obligations.,UNGD
USA,1996,"However, we also support the process of reform, which",UNGD
USA,1996,has done great work in reforming and streamlining the,UNGD
USA,1996,3,UNGD
USA,1996,,UNGD
USA,1996,,UNGD
USA,1996,"bureaucracy and reining in the budget, and it should",UNGD
USA,1996,continue.,UNGD
USA,1996,We also believe that all of us — the nations of the,UNGD
USA,1996,world working together — must do more to fight terrorism.,UNGD
USA,1996,Last year I asked the nations assembled here to commit to,UNGD
USA,1996,"a goal of zero tolerance for aggression, terrorism and",UNGD
USA,1996,"lawless behaviour. Frankly, we have not done that yet. Real",UNGD
USA,1996,zero tolerance means giving no aid and no quarter to,UNGD
USA,1996,terrorists who slaughter the innocent and drug traffickers,UNGD
USA,1996,"who poison our children, and doing everything we can to",UNGD
USA,1996,prevent weapons of mass destruction from falling into the,UNGD
USA,1996,wrong hands. Real zero tolerance requires us to isolate,UNGD
USA,1996,States that refuse to play by the rules we have all accepted,UNGD
USA,1996,for civilized behaviour. As long as Iraq threatens its,UNGD
USA,1996,"neighbours and its people, as long as Iran supports and",UNGD
USA,1996,"protects terrorists, as long as Libya refuses to give up the",UNGD
USA,1996,"people who blew up Pan Am 103, they should not become",UNGD
USA,1996,full members of the family of nations.,UNGD
USA,1996,The United States is pursuing a three-part strategy,UNGD
USA,1996,"against terrorists: abroad, by working more closely than",UNGD
USA,1996,ever with like-minded nations; at home by giving our law,UNGD
USA,1996,"enforcement the toughest counter-terrorism tools available,",UNGD
USA,1996,and by doing all we can to make our airports and the,UNGD
USA,1996,aeroplanes that link us all together even safer. I have,UNGD
USA,1996,requested more than $1 billion from our Congress to meet,UNGD
USA,1996,"these commitments, and we are implementing the United",UNGD
USA,1996,States Vice President's aviation security plan to make those,UNGD
USA,1996,"travelling to, from and within the United States more",UNGD
USA,1996,secure.,UNGD
USA,1996,"There are other steps we must take together. Last year,",UNGD
USA,1996,I urged that together we crack down on money laundering,UNGD
USA,1996,"and front companies, shut down gray markets for guns,",UNGD
USA,1996,"explosives and false documents, open more law",UNGD
USA,1996,enforcement centres around the world and strengthen,UNGD
USA,1996,safeguards on lethal materials. In each of these areas we,UNGD
USA,1996,"have made progress, through the United Nations, at the",UNGD
USA,1996,"Summit of Peacemakers in Sharm el-Sheikh, at the Paris",UNGD
USA,1996,terrorism conference and individually.,UNGD
USA,1996,Now we should adopt the declaration on crime and,UNGD
USA,1996,public security I proposed last year. It includes a no-,UNGD
USA,1996,"sanctuary pledge, so that we can say with one voice to the",UNGD
USA,1996,"terrorists, criminals and drug traffickers: “You have no",UNGD
USA,1996,"place to run, no place to hide.” I call on every Member to",UNGD
USA,1996,ratify 11 international conventions that would help prevent,UNGD
USA,1996,and punish terrorism and to criminalize the use of,UNGD
USA,1996,explosives in terrorist attacks.,UNGD
USA,1996,To every nation whose children fall prey to,UNGD
USA,1996,drugs and every nation that makes those drugs: we must,UNGD
USA,1996,do more to reduce demand and to take illegal drugs off,UNGD
USA,1996,the market and off the streets. The United States will do,UNGD
USA,1996,"its part. Next week, I will target more than $100-million",UNGD
USA,1996,"worth of defence equipment, services and training to",UNGD
USA,1996,"Mexico, Colombia and other South American and",UNGD
USA,1996,Caribbean countries.,UNGD
USA,1996,These resources will help our friends stop the flow,UNGD
USA,1996,of drugs at the source. Now I ask every nation that,UNGD
USA,1996,exports the chemicals needed to make illicit drugs to,UNGD
USA,1996,create an informal group whose members will work to,UNGD
USA,1996,deny these chemicals to drug producers. We must not let,UNGD
USA,1996,more drugs darken the dawn of the next century.,UNGD
USA,1996,Our duty to fight all these forces of destruction is,UNGD
USA,1996,directly linked to our efforts to reduce the threat of,UNGD
USA,1996,weapons of mass destruction. We all know we are not,UNGD
USA,1996,immune from this. We saw it when our friends in Japan,UNGD
USA,1996,were subject to the murderous power of a small vial of,UNGD
USA,1996,sarin gas unleashed in the Tokyo subway. We know a,UNGD
USA,1996,small lump of plutonium is enough to build a nuclear,UNGD
USA,1996,bomb. We know that more dangerous people have access,UNGD
USA,1996,to materials of mass destruction because of the rapid,UNGD
USA,1996,movement and open borders of this age. The quest to,UNGD
USA,1996,eliminate these problems from the world’s arsenals and to,UNGD
USA,1996,stop them from spreading has taken on a new and,UNGD
USA,1996,powerful urgency for all of us.,UNGD
USA,1996,So let us strengthen our determination to fight the,UNGD
USA,1996,"rogue States, the terrorists and the criminals who menace",UNGD
USA,1996,"our safety, our way of life and the potential of our",UNGD
USA,1996,children in the twenty-first century. Let us recommit,UNGD
USA,1996,ourselves to prevent them from acquiring weapons of,UNGD
USA,1996,mass destruction. Let us work harder than ever to lift the,UNGD
USA,1996,nuclear backdrop that has darkened the world’s stage for,UNGD
USA,1996,too long now. Let us make these solemn tasks our,UNGD
USA,1996,"common obligation, our common commitment; if we do,",UNGD
USA,1996,then together we will enter the twenty-first century,UNGD
USA,1996,"marching towards a better, safer world — the very better,",UNGD

USA,1997,debts and dues behind us once and for all and to put the,UNGD
USA,1997,United Nations on a sounder financial footing for the,UNGD

USA,1997,forward together.,UNGD
USA,1997,At the dawn of a new century so full of hope but not,UNGD

USA,1998,Let me begin by thanking the,UNGD
USA,1998,Assembly for its very kind and generous welcome and by,UNGD
USA,1998,"noting that, at the opening of this fifty-third session of the",UNGD
USA,1998,"General Assembly, the world has much to celebrate.",UNGD
USA,1998,Peace has come to Northern Ireland after 29 long years.,UNGD
USA,1998,Bosnia has just held its freest elections ever. The United,UNGD
USA,1998,Nations is actively mediating crises before they explode,UNGD
USA,1998,"into war, all around the world. And today more people",UNGD
USA,1998,determine their own destiny than at any previous moment,UNGD
USA,1998,in history.,UNGD
USA,1998,We celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal,UNGD
USA,1998,Declaration of Human Rights with those rights more,UNGD
USA,1998,widely embraced than ever before. On every continent,UNGD
USA,1998,"people are leading lives of integrity and self-respect, and",UNGD
USA,1998,a great deal of the credit for that belongs to the United,UNGD
USA,1998,Nations.,UNGD
USA,1998,"Still, as every person in this Hall knows, the promise",UNGD
USA,1998,of our time is attended by perils. Global economic turmoil,UNGD
USA,1998,today threatens to undermine confidence in free markets,UNGD
USA,1998,and democracy. Those of us who benefit particularly from,UNGD
USA,1998,this economy have a special responsibility to do more to,UNGD
USA,1998,minimize the turmoil and extend the benefits of global,UNGD
USA,1998,markets to all citizens. And the United States is,UNGD
USA,1998,determined to do that.,UNGD
USA,1998,"We still are bedevilled by ethnic, racial, religious",UNGD
USA,1998,"and tribal hatreds, by the spread of weapons of mass",UNGD
USA,1998,"destruction, by the almost frantic efforts of too many",UNGD
USA,1998,States to acquire such weapons.,UNGD
USA,1998,"And, despite all efforts to contain it, terrorism is not",UNGD
USA,1998,fading away with the end of the twentieth century. It is a,UNGD
USA,1998,continuing defiance of article 3 of the Universal,UNGD
USA,1998,"Declaration of Human Rights, which says",UNGD
USA,1998,9,UNGD
USA,1998,,UNGD
USA,1998,,UNGD
USA,1998,"“Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of",UNGD
USA,1998,person.”,UNGD
USA,1998,"Here at the United Nations, at international summits",UNGD
USA,1998,around the world and on many occasions in the United,UNGD
USA,1998,"States, I have had the opportunity to address this subject in",UNGD
USA,1998,"detail, to describe what we have done, what we are doing",UNGD
USA,1998,and what we must yet do to combat terror.,UNGD
USA,1998,Today I would like to talk to the Assembly about why,UNGD
USA,1998,all nations must put the fight against terrorism at the top of,UNGD
USA,1998,our agenda. Obviously this is a matter of profound concern,UNGD
USA,1998,to us. In the last 15 years our citizens have been targeted,UNGD
USA,1998,over and over again: in Beirut; over Lockerbie; in Saudi,UNGD
USA,1998,Arabia; at home in Oklahoma City by one of our own,UNGD
USA,1998,"citizens; even here in New York, in one of our most public",UNGD
USA,1998,"buildings; and most recently, on 7 August, in Nairobi and",UNGD
USA,1998,"Dar-es-Salaam, where Americans who devoted their lives",UNGD
USA,1998,to building bridges between nations — people very much,UNGD
USA,1998,like all of those present — died in a campaign of hatred,UNGD
USA,1998,against the United States.,UNGD
USA,1998,"Because we are blessed to be a wealthy nation, with",UNGD
USA,1998,a powerful military and a worldwide presence active in,UNGD
USA,1998,"promoting peace and security, we are often a target. We",UNGD
USA,1998,love our country for its dedication to political and religious,UNGD
USA,1998,"freedom, to economic opportunity, to respect for the rights",UNGD
USA,1998,of the individual. But we know that many people see us as,UNGD
USA,1998,a symbol of a system and values they reject. And often they,UNGD
USA,1998,find it expedient to blame us for problems with deep roots,UNGD
USA,1998,elsewhere.,UNGD
USA,1998,"But we are no threat to any peaceful nation, and we",UNGD
USA,1998,believe the best way to disprove these claims is to continue,UNGD
USA,1998,our work for peace and prosperity around the world. For us,UNGD
USA,1998,"to pull back from the world’s trouble spots, to turn our",UNGD
USA,1998,"backs on those taking risks for peace, to weaken our own",UNGD
USA,1998,"opposition to terrorism, would hand the enemies of peace",UNGD
USA,1998,a victory they must never have.,UNGD
USA,1998,"Still, it is a grave misconception to see terrorism as",UNGD
USA,1998,"only, or even mostly, an American problem. Indeed, it is a",UNGD
USA,1998,clear and present danger to tolerant and open societies and,UNGD
USA,1998,"innocent people everywhere. No one in this room, nor the",UNGD
USA,1998,"people represented here, is immune. Certainly not the",UNGD
USA,1998,people of Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam. For every American,UNGD
USA,1998,"killed there, roughly 20 Africans were murdered and 500",UNGD
USA,1998,more injured — innocent people going about their business,UNGD
USA,1998,on a busy morning.,UNGD
USA,1998,"Not the people of Omagh, in Northern Ireland, where",UNGD
USA,1998,the wounded and killed were Catholics and Protestants,UNGD
USA,1998,"alike — mostly children and women, two of them",UNGD
USA,1998,pregnant — people out shopping together when their,UNGD
USA,1998,future was snuffed out by a fringe group clinging to the,UNGD
USA,1998,past.,UNGD
USA,1998,"Not the people of Japan, who were poisoned by sarin",UNGD
USA,1998,gas in the Tokyo subway.,UNGD
USA,1998,"Not the people of Argentina, who died when a car",UNGD
USA,1998,bomb destroyed a Jewish community centre in Buenos,UNGD
USA,1998,Aires.,UNGD
USA,1998,"Not the people of Kashmir and Sri Lanka, killed by",UNGD
USA,1998,ancient animosities that cry out for resolution.,UNGD
USA,1998,"Not the Palestinians and Israelis, who still die year",UNGD
USA,1998,"after year, for all their progress towards peace.",UNGD
USA,1998,"Not the people of Algeria, enduring a nightmare of",UNGD
USA,1998,unfathomable terror with still no end in sight.,UNGD
USA,1998,"Not the people of Egypt, who nearly lost a second",UNGD
USA,1998,President to assassination.,UNGD
USA,1998,"Not the people of Turkey, Colombia, Albania,",UNGD
USA,1998,"Russia, Iran, Indonesia and countless other nations where",UNGD
USA,1998,innocent people have been victimized by terror.,UNGD
USA,1998,None of those victims were American. But every,UNGD
USA,1998,"one was a son or daughter, a husband or wife, a father or",UNGD
USA,1998,mother — a human life extinguished by someone else’s,UNGD
USA,1998,"hatred, leaving a circle of people whose lives will never",UNGD
USA,1998,be the same.,UNGD
USA,1998,"Terror has become the world’s problem. Some argue,",UNGD
USA,1998,"of course, that the problem is overblown, saying that the",UNGD
USA,1998,"number of deaths from terrorism is comparatively small,",UNGD
USA,1998,sometimes less than the number of people killed by,UNGD
USA,1998,lightning in a single year. I believe that misses the point,UNGD
USA,1998,"in several ways. First, terrorism has a new face in the",UNGD
USA,1998,"1990s. Today, terrorists take advantage of greater",UNGD
USA,1998,openness and the explosion of information and weapons,UNGD
USA,1998,technology. The new technologies of terror and their,UNGD
USA,1998,"increasing availability, along with the increasing mobility",UNGD
USA,1998,"of terrorists, raise chilling prospects of vulnerability to",UNGD
USA,1998,"chemical, biological and other kinds of attacks, bringing",UNGD
USA,1998,each of us into the category of possible victim. This is a,UNGD
USA,1998,threat to all humankind.,UNGD
USA,1998,"Beyond the physical damage of each attack, there is",UNGD
USA,1998,"an even greater residue of psychological damage, hard to",UNGD
USA,1998,"measure but slow to heal. Every bomb, every bomb",UNGD
USA,1998,10,UNGD
USA,1998,,UNGD
USA,1998,,UNGD
USA,1998,"threat, has an insidious effect on free and open institutions;",UNGD
USA,1998,the kinds of institutions everyone in this body is working so,UNGD
USA,1998,hard to build. Each time an innocent man or woman or,UNGD
USA,1998,"child is killed, it makes the future more hazardous for the",UNGD
USA,1998,"rest of us, for each violent act saps the confidence that is so",UNGD
USA,1998,crucial to peace and prosperity.,UNGD
USA,1998,"In every corner of the world, with the active support",UNGD
USA,1998,"of United Nations agencies, people are struggling to build",UNGD
USA,1998,better futures based on bonds of trust connecting them with,UNGD
USA,1998,their fellow citizens and with partners and investors from,UNGD
USA,1998,around the world. The glimpse of growing prosperity in,UNGD
USA,1998,Northern Ireland was a crucial factor in the Good Friday,UNGD
USA,1998,"Agreement. But that took confidence, confidence that",UNGD
USA,1998,cannot be bought in times of violence. We can measure,UNGD
USA,1998,each attack in the grisly statistics of dead and wounded. But,UNGD
USA,1998,what are the wounds we cannot measure? In the Middle,UNGD
USA,1998,"East, in Asia, in South America — how many agreements",UNGD
USA,1998,have been thwarted after bombs blew up? How many,UNGD
USA,1998,businesses will never be created in places crying out for,UNGD
USA,1998,investments of time and money? How many talented young,UNGD
USA,1998,people in countries represented here have turned their backs,UNGD
USA,1998,on public service? The question is not only how many lives,UNGD
USA,1998,"have been lost in each attack, but how many futures were",UNGD
USA,1998,lost in their aftermath.,UNGD
USA,1998,There is no justification for killing innocents.,UNGD
USA,1998,"Ideology, religion and politics, even deprivation and",UNGD
USA,1998,"righteous grievance, do not justify it. We must seek to",UNGD
USA,1998,understand the roiled waters in which terror occurs. Of,UNGD
USA,1998,course we must. Often in my own experience I have seen,UNGD
USA,1998,"that where peace is making progress, terror is a desperate",UNGD
USA,1998,act to turn back the tide of history. The Omagh bombing,UNGD
USA,1998,came as peace was succeeding in Northern Ireland. In the,UNGD
USA,1998,"Middle East, whenever we get close to another step towards",UNGD
USA,1998,"peace, its enemies respond with terror. We must not let this",UNGD
USA,1998,"stall our momentum. The bridging of ancient hatreds is,",UNGD
USA,1998,"after all, a leap of faith — a break with the past — and",UNGD
USA,1998,thus a frightening threat to those who cannot let go of their,UNGD
USA,1998,"own hatred. Because they fear the future, in these cases",UNGD
USA,1998,terrorists seek to blow the peacemakers back into the past.,UNGD
USA,1998,We must also acknowledge that there are economic,UNGD
USA,1998,"sources of this rage as well. Poverty, inequality and masses",UNGD
USA,1998,of disenfranchised young people are fertile fields for the,UNGD
USA,1998,siren call of the terrorists and their claims of advancing,UNGD
USA,1998,social justice. But deprivation cannot justify destruction; nor,UNGD
USA,1998,can inequity ever atone for murder. The killing of innocents,UNGD
USA,1998,is not a social programme.,UNGD
USA,1998,"Nevertheless, our resolute opposition to terrorism does",UNGD
USA,1998,not mean we can ever be indifferent to the conditions that,UNGD
USA,1998,foster it. The most recent United Nations Human,UNGD
USA,1998,Development Report suggests the gulf is widening,UNGD
USA,1998,between the world’s haves and have-nots. We must work,UNGD
USA,1998,harder to treat the sources of despair before they turn into,UNGD
USA,1998,the poison of hatred.,UNGD
USA,1998,"Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., once wrote that the only",UNGD
USA,1998,revolutionary is a man who has nothing to lose. We must,UNGD
USA,1998,show people they have everything to gain by embracing,UNGD
USA,1998,cooperation and renouncing violence. This is not simply,UNGD
USA,1998,an American or a Western responsibility; it is the world’s,UNGD
USA,1998,responsibility. Developing nations have an obligation to,UNGD
USA,1998,"spread new wealth fairly, to create new opportunities, to",UNGD
USA,1998,"build new, open economies. Developed nations have an",UNGD
USA,1998,obligation to help developing nations stay on the path of,UNGD
USA,1998,prosperity and to spur global economic growth. A week,UNGD
USA,1998,ago I outlined ways we can build a stronger international,UNGD
USA,1998,"economy to benefit not only all nations, but all citizens",UNGD
USA,1998,within them.,UNGD
USA,1998,Some believe that terrorism’s principal fault line,UNGD
USA,1998,centres on what they see as an inevitable clash of,UNGD
USA,1998,civilizations. This is an issue that deserves a lot of debate,UNGD
USA,1998,"in this great Hall. Specifically, many believe there is an",UNGD
USA,1998,inevitable clash between Western civilization and values,UNGD
USA,1998,and Islamic civilization and values. I believe this view is,UNGD
USA,1998,terribly wrong. False prophets may use and abuse any,UNGD
USA,1998,religion to justify whatever political objectives they,UNGD
USA,1998,have — even cold-blooded murder. Some may have the,UNGD
USA,1998,"world believe that Almighty God Himself, the merciful,",UNGD
USA,1998,grants a licence to kill; but that is not our understanding,UNGD
USA,1998,of Islam.,UNGD
USA,1998,"A quarter of the world’s population is Muslim, from",UNGD
USA,1998,Africa to the Middle East to Asia and to the United,UNGD
USA,1998,"States, where Islam is one of our fastest growing faiths.",UNGD
USA,1998,"There are over 1,200 mosques and Islamic centres in the",UNGD
USA,1998,"United States, and that number is rapidly increasing. The",UNGD
USA,1998,6 million Americans who worship there will tell you there,UNGD
USA,1998,is no inherent clash between Islam and America.,UNGD
USA,1998,Americans respect and honour Islam.,UNGD
USA,1998,As I talk to Muslim leaders in my country and,UNGD
USA,1998,"around the world, I see again that we share the same",UNGD
USA,1998,"hopes and aspirations: to live in peace and security, to",UNGD
USA,1998,"provide for our children, to follow the faith of our",UNGD
USA,1998,"choosing, to build a better life than our parents knew and",UNGD
USA,1998,to pass on brighter possibilities to our children.,UNGD
USA,1998,"Of course, we are not identical. There are important",UNGD
USA,1998,differences that cross race and culture and religion which,UNGD
USA,1998,demand understanding and deserve respect. But every,UNGD
USA,1998,11,UNGD
USA,1998,,UNGD
USA,1998,,UNGD
USA,1998,river has a crossing place. Even as we struggle here in,UNGD
USA,1998,"America, like the United Nations, to reconcile all",UNGD
USA,1998,Americans to each other and to find greater unity in our,UNGD
USA,1998,"increasing diversity, we will remain on a course of",UNGD
USA,1998,friendship with and respect for the Muslim world. We will,UNGD
USA,1998,"continue to look for common values, common interests and",UNGD
USA,1998,common endeavours. I agree very much with the spirit,UNGD
USA,1998,expressed by these words of Mohammed: “Rewards for,UNGD
USA,1998,prayers by people assembled together are twice those for,UNGD
USA,1998,prayers said at home.”,UNGD

USA,1998,the concrete steps we can take together to protect our,UNGD
USA,1998,common destiny? What are our common obligations? At,UNGD
USA,1998,"least, I believe, they are these: to give terrorists no support,",UNGD
USA,1998,"no sanctuary, no financial assistance; to bring pressure on",UNGD
USA,1998,States that do; to act together to step up extradition and,UNGD
USA,1998,prosecution; to sign the global anti-terror conventions; to,UNGD
USA,1998,strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention and enforce,UNGD
USA,1998,the Chemical Weapons Convention; to promote stronger,UNGD
USA,1998,domestic laws and control the manufacture and export of,UNGD

USA,1998,security; to combat the conditions that spread violence and,UNGD
USA,1998,despair.,UNGD
USA,1998,We are working to do our part. Our intelligence and,UNGD
USA,1998,law enforcement communities are tracking terrorist,UNGD
USA,1998,networks in cooperation with other Governments. Some of,UNGD
USA,1998,those we believe responsible for the recent bombing of our,UNGD
USA,1998,embassies have been brought to justice. Early this week I,UNGD
USA,1998,will ask our Congress to provide emergency funding to,UNGD
USA,1998,"repair our embassies, to improve security, to expand the",UNGD
USA,1998,worldwide fight against terrorism and to help our friends in,UNGD
USA,1998,Kenya and Tanzania with the wounds they have suffered.,UNGD
USA,1998,"But no matter how much each of us does alone, our",UNGD
USA,1998,progress will be limited without our common efforts.,UNGD
USA,1998,We will also do our part to address the sources of,UNGD
USA,1998,despair and alienation through the Agency for International,UNGD
USA,1998,"Development in Africa, in Asia, in Latin America, in",UNGD
USA,1998,"Eastern Europe, in Haiti and elsewhere. We will continue",UNGD
USA,1998,our strong support for the United Nations Development,UNGD

USA,1998,"these agencies play and the importance of all countries,",UNGD
USA,1998,"including the United States, in paying their fair share.",UNGD
USA,1998,"In closing, let me urge all of us to think in new",UNGD
USA,1998,"terms on terrorism, to see it not as a clash of cultures, or",UNGD
USA,1998,"political action by other means, or a divine calling, but as",UNGD
USA,1998,a clash between the forces of the past and the forces of,UNGD
USA,1998,"the future, between those who tear down and those who",UNGD
USA,1998,"build up, between hope and fear, between chaos and",UNGD
USA,1998,community.,UNGD
USA,1998,The fight will not be easy. But every nation will be,UNGD
USA,1998,"strengthened in joining it, in working to give real meaning",UNGD
USA,1998,to the words of the Universal Declaration of Human,UNGD
USA,1998,"Rights we signed 50 years ago. It is very, very important",UNGD
USA,1998,that we do this together.,UNGD
USA,1998,Eleanor Roosevelt was one of the authors of the,UNGD
USA,1998,"Universal Declaration. She said, in one of her many",UNGD
USA,1998,speeches in support of the United Nations when it was,UNGD
USA,1998,"just beginning,",UNGD
USA,1998,“All agreements and all peace are built on,UNGD
USA,1998,confidence. You cannot have peace and you cannot,UNGD
USA,1998,get on with other people in the world unless you,UNGD
USA,1998,have confidence in them.”,UNGD
USA,1998,It is not necessary that we solve all the world’s,UNGD
USA,1998,problems to have confidence in one another. It is not,UNGD
USA,1998,necessary that we agree on all the world’s issues to have,UNGD
USA,1998,confidence in one another. It is not even necessary that,UNGD
USA,1998,we understand every single difference among us to have,UNGD
USA,1998,confidence in one another. But it is necessary that we,UNGD
USA,1998,affirm our belief in the primacy of the Universal,UNGD
USA,1998,"Declaration of Human Rights, and therefore that together",UNGD
USA,1998,we say that terror is not a way to tomorrow. It is only a,UNGD
USA,1998,"throwback to yesterday, and together, together we can",UNGD
USA,1998,"meet it and overcome its threats, its injuries and its fears",UNGD
USA,1998,with confidence.,UNGD

USA,1999,"Today, we look ahead to the",UNGD
USA,1999,new millennium. And at this last General Assembly of the,UNGD
USA,1999,"twentieth century, we look back on a century that taught",UNGD
USA,1999,us much of what we need to know about the promise of,UNGD
USA,1999,tomorrow. We have learned a great deal over the last one,UNGD
USA,1999,hundred years: how to produce enough food for a,UNGD
USA,1999,growing world population; how human activity affects the,UNGD
USA,1999,environment; the mysteries of the human gene. An,UNGD
USA,1999,information revolution now holds the promise of universal,UNGD
USA,1999,access to knowledge. We have learned that open markets,UNGD
USA,1999,"create more wealth, that open societies are more just. We",UNGD
USA,1999,"have learned how to come together, through the United",UNGD
USA,1999,"Nations and other institutions, to advance common",UNGD
USA,1999,interests and values.,UNGD
USA,1999,"Yet for all our intellectual and material advances, the",UNGD
USA,1999,twentieth century has been deeply scarred by enduring,UNGD

USA,1999,hot-blooded hatreds and stone-cold hearts. At century’s,UNGD
USA,1999,"end, modern developments magnify greatly the dangers of",UNGD
USA,1999,these timeless flaws. Powerful forces still resist,UNGD
USA,1999,reasonable efforts to put a human face on the global,UNGD

USA,1999,"human development in history, even as they make a",UNGD
USA,1999,wasteland of the soul.,UNGD
USA,1999,"Therefore, we look to the future with hope, but with",UNGD
USA,1999,"unanswered questions. In the new millennium, will nations",UNGD
USA,1999,be divided by ethnic and religious conflicts? Will the,UNGD
USA,1999,"nation-state itself be imperiled by them, or by terrorism? Or",UNGD
USA,1999,"will we keep coming closer together instead, while enjoying",UNGD
USA,1999,the normal differences that make life more interesting? In,UNGD
USA,1999,"the new century, how will patriotism be defined — as faith",UNGD
USA,1999,"in a dream worth living, or as fear and loathing of other",UNGD
USA,1999,people’s dreams? Will we be free of the fear of weapons of,UNGD
USA,1999,"mass destruction, or forced to teach our grandchildren how",UNGD
USA,1999,"to survive a nuclear, chemical or biological attack? Will",UNGD
USA,1999,"globalism bring shared prosperity, or will it make the",UNGD
USA,1999,desperate of the world even more desperate? Will we use,UNGD
USA,1999,science and technology to grow the economy and protect,UNGD
USA,1999,"the environment, or put it all at risk in a world dominated",UNGD
USA,1999,by a struggle over natural resources?,UNGD
USA,1999,The truth is that the twentieth century’s amazing,UNGD
USA,1999,progress has not resolved these questions. But it has given,UNGD
USA,1999,us the tools to make the answers come out right — the,UNGD
USA,1999,"knowledge, the resources, the institutions. Now, we must",UNGD
USA,1999,"use them. If we do, we can make the millennium not just",UNGD
USA,1999,"a changing of the digits, but a true changing of the times —",UNGD
USA,1999,"a gateway to greater peace, prosperity and freedom. With",UNGD
USA,1999,"that in mind, I offer three resolutions for the new",UNGD
USA,1999,millennium.,UNGD
USA,1999,"First, let us resolve to wage an unrelenting battle",UNGD
USA,1999,against poverty and for shared prosperity so that no part of,UNGD
USA,1999,humanity is left behind in the global economy.,UNGD
USA,1999,Globalization is not inherently divisive. While infant,UNGD
USA,1999,mortality in developing countries has been cut nearly in half,UNGD
USA,1999,"since 1970, life expectancy has increased by 10 years.",UNGD
USA,1999,According to the United Nations Human Development,UNGD
USA,1999,"Index, which measures a decent standard of living, a good",UNGD
USA,1999,"education, a long and healthy life, the gap between rich and",UNGD
USA,1999,poor countries on this measure has actually declined.,UNGD
USA,1999,Open trade and new technologies have been engines,UNGD
USA,1999,of this progress; they have helped hundreds of millions to,UNGD
USA,1999,see their prospects rise by marketing the fruits of their labor,UNGD
USA,1999,"and creativity abroad. With proper investments in education,",UNGD
USA,1999,developing countries should be able to keep their best and,UNGD
USA,1999,brightest talent at home and to gain access to global,UNGD
USA,1999,markets for goods and services and capital.,UNGD
USA,1999,But this promising future is far from inevitable. We,UNGD
USA,1999,are still squandering the potential of far too many. As many,UNGD
USA,1999,as 1.3 billion people still live on less than a dollar a day.,UNGD
USA,1999,More than half the population of many countries has no,UNGD
USA,1999,access to safe water. A person in South Asia is 700 times,UNGD
USA,1999,less likely to use the Internet than someone in the United,UNGD
USA,1999,"States. Forty million people a year still die of hunger,",UNGD
USA,1999,almost as many as the total number killed in World,UNGD
USA,1999,War II. We must refuse to accept a future in which one,UNGD
USA,1999,part of humanity lives on the cutting edge of a new,UNGD
USA,1999,"economy, while the other lives at the knife edge of",UNGD
USA,1999,survival.,UNGD
USA,1999,What must we do? We can start by remembering,UNGD
USA,1999,that open markets advance the blessings and,UNGD
USA,1999,breakthroughs we want to spread. That is why we in the,UNGD
USA,1999,United States have worked to keep our markets open,UNGD
USA,1999,"during the recent global financial crisis, though it has",UNGD
USA,1999,brought us record trade deficits. It is why we want to,UNGD
USA,1999,launch a new global trade round when the World Trade,UNGD
USA,1999,Organization meets in Seattle this fall. It is why we are,UNGD
USA,1999,working to build a trading system that strengthens the,UNGD
USA,1999,"well-being of workers and consumers, protects the",UNGD
USA,1999,"environment and makes competition a race to the top, not",UNGD
USA,1999,the bottom. It is why I am proud we have come together,UNGD
USA,1999,at the International Labour Organization to ban abusive,UNGD
USA,1999,child labour everywhere in the world.,UNGD
USA,1999,"We do not face a choice between trade and aid, but",UNGD
USA,1999,instead the challenge to make both work for people who,UNGD
USA,1999,need them. Aid should focus on what is known to work:,UNGD
USA,1999,"credit for poor people starting businesses, keeping girls in",UNGD
USA,1999,"school, meeting the needs of mothers and children.",UNGD
USA,1999,"Development aid should be used for development, not to",UNGD
USA,1999,buy influence or finance donors’ exports. It should go,UNGD
USA,1999,where Governments invest in their people and answer to,UNGD
USA,1999,their concerns.,UNGD
USA,1999,We should also come to the aid of countries,UNGD
USA,1999,struggling to rise but held down by the burden of debt.,UNGD
USA,1999,The G-7 nations have adopted a plan to reduce by up to,UNGD
USA,1999,70 per cent the outstanding debt of the world’s poorest,UNGD
USA,1999,"countries, freeing resources for education, health and",UNGD
USA,1999,growth.,UNGD
USA,1999,"All of us, developed and developing countries alike,",UNGD
USA,1999,should take action now to halt global climate change.,UNGD
USA,1999,What has that to do with fighting poverty? A great deal.,UNGD
USA,1999,The most vulnerable members of the human family will,UNGD
USA,1999,be hurt first and hurt most if rising temperatures devastate,UNGD
USA,1999,"agriculture, accelerate the spread of disease in tropical",UNGD
USA,1999,countries and flood island nations.,UNGD
USA,1999,3,UNGD
USA,1999,,UNGD
USA,1999,,UNGD
USA,1999,Does this mean developing countries must sacrifice,UNGD
USA,1999,growth to protect the environment? Absolutely not.,UNGD
USA,1999,"Throughout history, a key to human progress has been",UNGD
USA,1999,willingness to abandon big ideas that are no longer true.,UNGD
USA,1999,One big idea that is no longer true is that the only way to,UNGD
USA,1999,build a modern economy is to use energy as we did in the,UNGD
USA,1999,industrial age. The challenge and opportunity for,UNGD
USA,1999,developing countries today is to skip the costs of the,UNGD
USA,1999,industrial age by using technologies that improve the,UNGD
USA,1999,economy and the environment at the same time.,UNGD
USA,1999,"Finally, to win the fight against poverty, we must",UNGD
USA,1999,improve health care for all people. Over the next 10 years,UNGD
USA,1999,"in Africa, AIDS is expected to kill more people and orphan",UNGD
USA,1999,more children than all the wars of the twentieth century,UNGD
USA,1999,"combined. Each year diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis",UNGD
USA,1999,and pneumonia leave millions of children without parents,UNGD
USA,1999,and millions of parents without children. Yet for all these,UNGD
USA,1999,"diseases, vaccine research is advancing too slowly, in part",UNGD
USA,1999,because the potential customers are too poor. Only 2 per,UNGD
USA,1999,cent of all global biomedical research is devoted to the,UNGD
USA,1999,major killers in the developing world.,UNGD
USA,1999,No country can break poverty’s bonds if its people are,UNGD
USA,1999,disabled by disease and its Government overwhelmed by,UNGD
USA,1999,"the needs of the ill. With United Nations leadership, we",UNGD
USA,1999,"have come close to eradicating polio, once the scourge of",UNGD
USA,1999,"children everywhere. We are down to 5,000 reported cases",UNGD
USA,1999,worldwide. I have asked our Congress to fund a major,UNGD
USA,1999,"increase to finish the job, and I ask other nations to follow",UNGD
USA,1999,suit. We have begun a comprehensive battle against the,UNGD
USA,1999,global AIDS epidemic. This year I am seeking another,UNGD
USA,1999,"$100 million for prevention, counselling and care in Africa.",UNGD
USA,1999,I want to do more to get to those who need them most new,UNGD
USA,1999,drugs that prevent transmission from mothers to newborns.,UNGD
USA,1999,And today I commit the United States to a concerted effort,UNGD
USA,1999,to accelerate the development and delivery of vaccines for,UNGD
USA,1999,"malaria, tuberculosis, AIDS and other diseases that",UNGD
USA,1999,disproportionately affect the developing world. Many,UNGD
USA,1999,"approaches have been proposed, from tax credits to special",UNGD
USA,1999,funds for the purchase of these vaccines.,UNGD
USA,1999,"To tackle these issues, I will ask public-health experts,",UNGD
USA,1999,the chief executive officers of our pharmaceutical,UNGD
USA,1999,"companies, foundation representatives and members of",UNGD
USA,1999,Congress to join me at a special White House meeting and,UNGD
USA,1999,"to strengthen incentives for research and development,",UNGD
USA,1999,"working with, not against, the private sector to meet our",UNGD
USA,1999,common goal.,UNGD
USA,1999,The second resolution I hope we will make today is to,UNGD
USA,1999,strengthen the capacity of the international community to,UNGD
USA,1999,prevent and whenever possible to stop outbreaks of mass,UNGD
USA,1999,"killing and displacement. This requires, as we all know,",UNGD
USA,1999,"shared responsibility, like the one West African nations",UNGD
USA,1999,accepted when they acted to restore peace in Sierra,UNGD
USA,1999,Leone; the one 19 democracies in the North Atlantic,UNGD
USA,1999,Treaty Organization (NATO) embraced to stop ethnic,UNGD
USA,1999,cleansing in Bosnia and in Kosovo; the one that Asian,UNGD
USA,1999,"and Pacific nations have now assumed in East Timor,",UNGD
USA,1999,"with the strong support of the entire United Nations,",UNGD
USA,1999,including the United States.,UNGD
USA,1999,Secretary-General Annan spoke for all of us during,UNGD
USA,1999,"the Kosovo conflict, and more recently in regard to East",UNGD
USA,1999,"Timor, when he said that ethnic cleansers and mass",UNGD
USA,1999,"murderers can find no refuge in the United Nations, no",UNGD
USA,1999,source of comfort or justification in its Charter. We must,UNGD
USA,1999,"do more to make these words real. Of course, we must",UNGD
USA,1999,approach this challenge with some considerable degree of,UNGD
USA,1999,"humility. It is easy to say “never again”, but much harder",UNGD
USA,1999,to make it so. Promising too much can be as cruel as,UNGD
USA,1999,caring too little.,UNGD
USA,1999,"But difficulties, dangers and costs are not an",UNGD
USA,1999,argument for doing nothing. When we are faced with,UNGD
USA,1999,"deliberate, organized campaigns to murder whole peoples",UNGD
USA,1999,"or expel them from their land, the care of victims is",UNGD
USA,1999,important but not enough. We should work to end the,UNGD
USA,1999,violence. Our response in every case cannot and should,UNGD
USA,1999,not be the same. Sometimes collective military force is,UNGD
USA,1999,both appropriate and feasible. Sometimes concerted,UNGD
USA,1999,economic and political pressure combined with diplomacy,UNGD
USA,1999,"is a better answer, as it was in making possible the",UNGD
USA,1999,"introduction of forces to East Timor. Of course, the way",UNGD
USA,1999,the international community responds will depend on the,UNGD
USA,1999,capacity of countries to act and on their perception of,UNGD
USA,1999,"their national interests. NATO acted in Kosovo, for",UNGD
USA,1999,"example, to stop a vicious campaign of ethnic cleansing",UNGD
USA,1999,in a place where we had important interests at stake and,UNGD
USA,1999,the ability to act collectively.,UNGD
USA,1999,The same considerations brought Nigerian troops and,UNGD
USA,1999,their partners to Sierra Leone and Australians and others,UNGD
USA,1999,to East Timor. That is proper — so long as we work,UNGD
USA,1999,"together, support each other and do not abdicate our",UNGD
USA,1999,collective responsibility. I know that some are troubled,UNGD
USA,1999,that the United States and others cannot respond to every,UNGD
USA,1999,humanitarian catastrophe in the world. We cannot do,UNGD
USA,1999,"everything, everywhere. But simply because we have",UNGD
USA,1999,different interests in different parts of the world does not,UNGD
USA,1999,mean we can be indifferent to the destruction of innocents,UNGD
USA,1999,in any part of the world. That is why we have supported,UNGD
USA,1999,the efforts of Africans to resolve the deadly conflicts that,UNGD
USA,1999,4,UNGD
USA,1999,,UNGD
USA,1999,,UNGD
USA,1999,have raged through parts of their continent. It is why we,UNGD
USA,1999,are working with friends in Africa to build the African,UNGD
USA,1999,"Crisis Response Initiative, which has trained more than",UNGD
USA,1999,"4,000 peacekeepers from six countries. It is why we are",UNGD
USA,1999,helping establish an international coalition against genocide,UNGD
USA,1999,to bring nations together to stop the flow of money and,UNGD
USA,1999,arms to those who commit crimes against humanity.,UNGD
USA,1999,There is also a critical need for countries emerging,UNGD
USA,1999,from conflict to build police institutions accountable to,UNGD
USA,1999,"people and the law, often with the help of civilian police",UNGD
USA,1999,from other nations. We need international forces with the,UNGD
USA,1999,training to fill the gap between local police and military,UNGD
USA,1999,"peacekeepers, as French, Argentine, Italian and other",UNGD
USA,1999,military police have done in Haiti and Bosnia. We will,UNGD
USA,1999,work with our partners and the United Nations to continue,UNGD
USA,1999,to ensure that such forces can deploy when they are needed.,UNGD
USA,1999,What is the role of the United Nations of in preventing,UNGD
USA,1999,mass slaughter and dislocation? Very large. Even in,UNGD
USA,1999,"Kosovo, NATO’s actions followed a clear consensus,",UNGD
USA,1999,"expressed in several Security Council resolutions, that the",UNGD
USA,1999,atrocities committed by Serb forces were unacceptable and,UNGD
USA,1999,that the international community had a compelling interest,UNGD
USA,1999,in seeing them end. Had we chosen to do nothing in the,UNGD
USA,1999,"face of this brutality, I do not believe we would have",UNGD
USA,1999,strengthened the United Nations. Instead we would have,UNGD
USA,1999,risked discrediting everything it stands for.,UNGD
USA,1999,"By acting as we did, we helped to vindicate the",UNGD
USA,1999,principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter to,UNGD
USA,1999,give the United Nations the opportunity it now has to play,UNGD
USA,1999,the central role in shaping Kosovo’s future. In the real,UNGD
USA,1999,"world, principles often collide and tough choices must be",UNGD
USA,1999,made. The outcome in Kosovo is hopeful.,UNGD
USA,1999,"Finally, as we enter this new era, let our third",UNGD
USA,1999,resolution be to protect our children against the possibility,UNGD
USA,1999,"that nuclear, chemical and biological weapons will ever be",UNGD
USA,1999,used again. The last millennium has seen constant advances,UNGD
USA,1999,in the destructive power of weaponry. In the coming,UNGD
USA,1999,"millennium, this trend can continue or, if we choose, we",UNGD
USA,1999,can reverse it with global standards universally respected.,UNGD
USA,1999,We have made more progress than many realize. After,UNGD
USA,1999,"the collapse of the Soviet Union, Belarus, Kazakhstan and",UNGD
USA,1999,Ukraine courageously chose to give up their nuclear,UNGD
USA,1999,weapons. America and Russia have moved forward with,UNGD
USA,1999,substantial arms reductions. President Yeltsin and I agreed,UNGD
USA,1999,"in June, even as we await Russian ratification of START II,",UNGD
USA,1999,to begin talks on a START III treaty that will cut our cold-,UNGD
USA,1999,war arsenals by 80 per cent from their height. Brazil has,UNGD
USA,1999,joined the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear,UNGD
USA,1999,"Weapons (NPT), capping a process that has almost totally",UNGD
USA,1999,eliminated the threat of nuclear proliferation in Latin,UNGD
USA,1999,America. We have banned chemical weapons from the,UNGD
USA,1999,"Earth, though we must implement that commitment fully",UNGD
USA,1999,and gain universal coverage. One hundred and fifty-two,UNGD
USA,1999,nations have signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban,UNGD
USA,1999,"Treaty and, while India and Pakistan did test nuclear",UNGD
USA,1999,"weapons last year, the international reaction proved that",UNGD
USA,1999,the global consensus against proliferation is very strong.,UNGD
USA,1999,We need to bolster the standards to reinforce that,UNGD
USA,1999,consensus. We must reaffirm our commitment to the,UNGD
USA,1999,"NPT, strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention and",UNGD
USA,1999,make fast progress on a treaty to ban production of fissile,UNGD
USA,1999,"materials. To keep existing stocks from the wrong hands,",UNGD
USA,1999,we should strengthen the Convention on Physical,UNGD
USA,1999,"Protection of Nuclear Materials. And today, again I ask",UNGD
USA,1999,our Congress to approve the Comprehensive Nuclear-,UNGD
USA,1999,Test-Ban Treaty.,UNGD
USA,1999,"We must stop the spread of nuclear weapons,",UNGD
USA,1999,"materials and expertise at the source. Since 1992, we have",UNGD
USA,1999,worked with Russia and the other nations of the former,UNGD
USA,1999,Soviet Union to do that. We are expanding that effort,UNGD
USA,1999,"because challenges remain, but thus far we can say that",UNGD
USA,1999,the nightmare scenario of deadly weapons flowing,UNGD
USA,1999,unchecked across borders and of scientists selling their,UNGD
USA,1999,services en masse to the highest bidder has been avoided.,UNGD
USA,1999,"Now, we must work to deny weapons of mass",UNGD
USA,1999,destruction to those who would use them. For almost a,UNGD
USA,1999,"decade, nations have stood together to keep the Iraqi",UNGD
USA,1999,regime from threatening its people and the world with,UNGD
USA,1999,such weapons. Despite all the obstacles Saddam Hussein,UNGD
USA,1999,"has placed in our path, we must continue to ease the",UNGD
USA,1999,"suffering of the people of Iraq. At the same time, we",UNGD
USA,1999,cannot allow the Government of Iraq to flout 40 — and,UNGD
USA,1999,I say 40 — successive United Nations Security Council,UNGD
USA,1999,resolutions and to rebuild his arsenal.,UNGD
USA,1999,Just as important is the challenge of keeping deadly,UNGD
USA,1999,weapons away from terrorist groups. They may have,UNGD
USA,1999,"weaker capabilities than States, but they have fewer",UNGD
USA,1999,compunctions about using such weapons. The possibility,UNGD
USA,1999,that terrorists will threaten us with weapons of mass,UNGD
USA,1999,destruction can be met with neither panic nor,UNGD
USA,1999,"complacency. It requires serious, deliberate, disciplined",UNGD
USA,1999,concern and effective cooperation from all of us.,UNGD
USA,1999,There are many other challenges. Today I have,UNGD
USA,1999,spoken about just three: the need to do something about,UNGD
USA,1999,5,UNGD
USA,1999,,UNGD
USA,1999,,UNGD
USA,1999,the world’s poor and to put a human face on the global,UNGD
USA,1999,economy; the need to do more to prevent killing and,UNGD
USA,1999,dislocation of innocents; the need to do more to ensure that,UNGD
USA,1999,weapons of mass destruction will never be used on our,UNGD
USA,1999,children. I believe they are the most important. In meeting,UNGD
USA,1999,"them, the United Nations is indispensable.",UNGD
USA,1999,It is precisely because we are committed to the United,UNGD
USA,1999,Nations that we have worked hard to support the effective,UNGD
USA,1999,management of this body. But the United States also has a,UNGD
USA,1999,responsibility to equip the United Nations with the,UNGD
USA,1999,resources it needs to be effective. As I think most Members,UNGD
USA,1999,"know, I have strongly supported the United States meeting",UNGD
USA,1999,all its financial obligations to the United Nations and I will,UNGD
USA,1999,continue to do so. We will do our very best to succeed this,UNGD
USA,1999,year.,UNGD
USA,1999,"When the cold war ended, the United States could",UNGD
USA,1999,have chosen to turn away from the opportunities and,UNGD
USA,1999,"dangers of the world. Instead, we have tried to be engaged,",UNGD
USA,1999,involved and active. We know this moment of unique,UNGD
USA,1999,prosperity and power for the United States is a source of,UNGD
USA,1999,concern to many. I can only answer by saying this: In the,UNGD
USA,1999,seven years that I have been privileged to come here to,UNGD
USA,1999,"speak to this body, America has tried to be a force for",UNGD
USA,1999,peace. We believe we are better off when nations resolve,UNGD
USA,1999,their differences by force of argument rather than force of,UNGD
USA,1999,arms. We have sought to help former adversaries like,UNGD
USA,1999,"Russia and China become prosperous, stable members of",UNGD
USA,1999,the world community because we feel far more threatened,UNGD
USA,1999,by the potential weakness of the world’s leading nations,UNGD
USA,1999,than by their strength. Instead of imposing our values on,UNGD
USA,1999,"others, we have sought to promote a system of",UNGD
USA,1999,government — democracy — that empowers people to,UNGD
USA,1999,choose their own destinies according to their own values,UNGD
USA,1999,and aspirations. We have sought to keep our markets open,UNGD
USA,1999,because we believe a strong world economy benefits our,UNGD
USA,1999,"own workers and businesses, as well as the people of the",UNGD
USA,1999,world who are selling to us. I hope that we have been and,UNGD
USA,1999,will continue to be good partners with the rest in the new,UNGD
USA,1999,millennium.,UNGD
USA,1999,"Not long ago, I went to a refugee camp in Macedonia.",UNGD
USA,1999,"The people I met there, children and adults alike, had",UNGD
USA,1999,"suffered horrible, horrible abuses, but they had never given",UNGD
USA,1999,up hope because they believed that there is an international,UNGD
USA,1999,community that stands for their dignity and their freedom.,UNGD
USA,1999,"I want to make sure that, 20 or 50 or 100 years from now,",UNGD
USA,1999,people everywhere will still believe that about our United,UNGD
USA,1999,"Nations. So let us resolve, in the bright dawn of the new",UNGD
USA,1999,"millennium, to bring in an era in which our desire to create",UNGD
USA,1999,"will overwhelm our capacity to destroy. If we do that, then,",UNGD
USA,1999,"through the United Nations and far-sighted leaders,",UNGD
USA,1999,humanity finally can live up to its name.,UNGD
USA,1999,,UNGD
USA,1999,,UNGD
USA,1999,,UNGD
USA,1999,,UNGD
USA,1999,,UNGD
USA,1999,,UNGD
USA,1999,,UNGD
USA,1999,,UNGD
USA,2000,I am,UNGD
USA,2000,honoured to address the Assembly on behalf of the,UNGD
USA,2000,United States and to reinforce the eloquent message,UNGD
USA,2000,President C1inton conveyed during last week's,UNGD
USA,2000,Millennium Summit. Because my father worked here,UNGD
USA,2000,"when I was young, I have always considered myself a",UNGD
USA,2000,child of the United Nations. And because I had the,UNGD
USA,2000,privilege to serve here as America's Permanent,UNGD
USA,2000,"Representative, I feel at home and so will speak",UNGD
USA,2000,plainly.,UNGD
USA,2000,The members of this body reflect virtually every,UNGD
USA,2000,"culture, ethnicity and geographical region. We are city",UNGD
USA,2000,"and country, inland and island, tropical and temperate,",UNGD
USA,2000,developing and industrialized. We are as diverse as,UNGD
USA,2000,humanity.,UNGD
USA,2000,"And yet, in responding to the daunting demands",UNGD
USA,2000,"of this new era, we are bound together by the interests",UNGD
USA,2000,we share and the ideals to which we aspire.,UNGD
USA,2000,We all have a stake in building peace and,UNGD
USA,2000,"relieving poverty, championing development and",UNGD
USA,2000,curbing disease. We all want to see the dangers posed,UNGD
USA,2000,"by weapons of mass destruction reduced, refugees",UNGD
USA,2000,"cared for, children nourished, the environment",UNGD
USA,2000,"protected, and the status of women advanced.",UNGD
USA,2000,We all believe the benefits of globalization must,UNGD
USA,2000,be allocated more broadly within and among societies.,UNGD
USA,2000,Because if the new technologies are to ease the old,UNGD
USA,2000,"problems, they must help the many who today lack",UNGD
USA,2000,"access and skills, so that every village becomes a home",UNGD
USA,2000,to opportunity and every school a midwife to hope.,UNGD
USA,2000,"As the Millennium Summit reflected, we have no",UNGD
USA,2000,shortage of worthy goals. We are right to aim high and,UNGD
USA,2000,take on the mightiest tasks.,UNGD
USA,2000,"But as the Secretary-General has said, progress",UNGD
USA,2000,depends on working together. We need all hands on,UNGD
USA,2000,"deck, pulling in the same direction. For each of us, that",UNGD
USA,2000,responsibility begins at home because the international,UNGD
USA,2000,community cannot help any nation that is not striving,UNGD
USA,2000,to help itself.,UNGD
USA,2000,Each Government has an obligation to observe,UNGD
USA,2000,"international norms on human rights, uphold the rule of",UNGD
USA,2000,"law, fight corruption and raise awareness about",UNGD
USA,2000,"HIV/AIDS. But in the twenty-first century, no nation",UNGD
USA,2000,can protect and serve its people simply by going it,UNGD
USA,2000,alone and that is why we  all benefit from,UNGD
USA,2000,strengthening regional bodies such as the Organization,UNGD
USA,2000,"of American States (OAS), the Organization of African",UNGD
USA,2000,"Unity (OAU), the Association of South-East Asian",UNGD
USA,2000,Nations (ASEAN) and the Organization for Security,UNGD
USA,2000,and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).,UNGD
USA,2000,Because of their unique expertise and regional,UNGD
USA,2000,"legitimacy, they can be instruments for solving some of",UNGD
USA,2000,the hardest challenges we face. But they will succeed,UNGD
USA,2000,only if we raise our expectations of these,UNGD
USA,2000,"organizations, call upon them to act boldly and back",UNGD
USA,2000,them when they do.,UNGD
USA,2000,Regional bodies can contribute much to the,UNGD
USA,2000,"purposes outlined in the Charter, and the goals",UNGD
USA,2000,established during the Millennium Summit. But here,UNGD
USA,2000,"again, they cannot do it all.",UNGD
USA,2000,8,UNGD
USA,2000,,UNGD
USA,2000,"The role of the United Nations is also vital,",UNGD
USA,2000,because no other institution combines a comprehensive,UNGD
USA,2000,mandate with near universal representation and global,UNGD
USA,2000,reach.,UNGD
USA,2000,We all have an interest in the success of the,UNGD
USA,2000,"United Nations. That is its greatest strength, and also",UNGD
USA,2000,"its burden, because 189 nations have to work very hard",UNGD
USA,2000,if they are to agree.,UNGD
USA,2000,"I remember when I came to New York in 1993, I",UNGD
USA,2000,was told by cynics that the United Nations was too,UNGD
USA,2000,"bureaucratic to change, and too big ever to achieve",UNGD
USA,2000,consensus on measures to improve its governance.,UNGD
USA,2000,Those cynics were wrong. With support from,UNGD
USA,2000,"many countries, we have made impressive progress.",UNGD
USA,2000,"Compared to seven years ago, the United Nations",UNGD
USA,2000,accomplishes more and wastes less. Accountability has,UNGD
USA,2000,increased and duplication diminished.,UNGD
USA,2000,"The Internal Oversight Office, which did not exist",UNGD
USA,2000,"in 1993, has grown steadily more rigorous and is",UNGD
USA,2000,responsible for tens of millions of dollars of savings. A,UNGD
USA,2000,culture of transparency and results is slowly but surely,UNGD
USA,2000,"taking hold. Moreover, both United Nations",UNGD
USA,2000,Headquarters and the entire United Nations system are,UNGD
USA,2000,better led than they have ever been.,UNGD
USA,2000,United Nations leaders and Members can take,UNGD
USA,2000,"pride in the gains made, but we all know there is much",UNGD
USA,2000,more work to be done.,UNGD
USA,2000,That is why we must back the Secretary General's,UNGD
USA,2000,"efforts to further improve United Nations management,",UNGD
USA,2000,recognizing that every dollar wasted is a dollar lost to,UNGD
USA,2000,the fight against poverty and to the achievement of,UNGD
USA,2000,other urgent goals.,UNGD
USA,2000,We must also move ahead rapidly to strengthen,UNGD
USA,2000,"peacekeeping, because it is the most visible and vital",UNGD
USA,2000,"yardstick of United Nations success and, for people in",UNGD
USA,2000,"strife-torn regions, often means the difference between",UNGD
USA,2000,a normal life and no life at all.,UNGD
USA,2000,There is no magic formula for curing the ills that,UNGD
USA,2000,have plagued United Nations peace operations in the,UNGD
USA,2000,"past. But the report, just prepared by Ambassador",UNGD
USA,2000,"Brahimi's team, is a solid place to start.",UNGD
USA,2000,"As President Clinton said last week, we need to",UNGD
USA,2000,ensure that United Nations peacekeepers can be,UNGD
USA,2000,deployed with the right training and equipment and the,UNGD
USA,2000,"right rules of engagement so they can achieve, not",UNGD
USA,2000,"merely attempt, their missions.",UNGD
USA,2000,"This will require a larger peacekeeping staff, on",UNGD
USA,2000,"permanent assignment, comprised of the best talent and",UNGD
USA,2000,experience we can find.,UNGD
USA,2000,It will require military planners the world over to,UNGD
USA,2000,recognize that training for peace operations is a,UNGD
USA,2000,legitimate part of every nation's security strategy. It,UNGD
USA,2000,will require the ability to deploy rapidly not only,UNGD
USA,2000,"United Nations military forces, but also civilian police",UNGD
USA,2000,and experts in law enforcement and judicial reform. It,UNGD
USA,2000,will demand improved coordination between military,UNGD
USA,2000,"peacekeepers and civilian builders of peace, so that",UNGD
USA,2000,missions begun are completed and recovery bred by,UNGD
USA,2000,reconciliation can take hold.,UNGD
USA,2000,And it will require additional resources from my,UNGD
USA,2000,Government and from each of yours. And by,UNGD
USA,2000,"“additional”, I mean resources that should not come at",UNGD
USA,2000,the expense of other core United Nations goals.,UNGD
USA,2000,The United States will heed the Secretary-,UNGD
USA,2000,General's request that we work together to consider,UNGD
USA,2000,and implement the best recommendations of the,UNGD
USA,2000,Brahimi report.,UNGD
USA,2000,"Whether for peacekeeping or programmes, the",UNGD
USA,2000,United Nations also needs a sustainable and equitable,UNGD
USA,2000,system of financing. We do not have that today.,UNGD
USA,2000,"Member States, including my own, must do a better job",UNGD
USA,2000,of making payments on time. But we must also look,UNGD
USA,2000,afresh at the method used to allocate responsibility for,UNGD
USA,2000,United Nations costs.,UNGD
USA,2000,"Last week, the Security Council called for",UNGD
USA,2000,adjustments in the scale of assessments. This plea has,UNGD
USA,2000,been echoed by dozens of other countries and should,UNGD
USA,2000,be acted upon by the General Assembly this fall.,UNGD
USA,2000,A more equitable system should provide a much,UNGD
USA,2000,stronger foundation for United Nations programmes,UNGD
USA,2000,and missions. It should preserve the special,UNGD
USA,2000,responsibility for peacekeeping of the Security,UNGD
USA,2000,Council's permanent members. It should retain a,UNGD
USA,2000,heavily discounted rate for the poorest countries. And,UNGD
USA,2000,it should reduce the United Nations overall reliance on,UNGD
USA,2000,"payments from the United States, while at the same",UNGD
USA,2000,time enabling my Government to write a check to the,UNGD
USA,2000,United Nations for nearly $600 million in prior,UNGD
USA,2000,obligations.,UNGD
USA,2000,9,UNGD
USA,2000,,UNGD
USA,2000,"Clearly, adjustments are long overdue. The",UNGD
USA,2000,United Nations needs a firm and reliable financial base.,UNGD
USA,2000,"In the weeks ahead, the United States will be pleased to",UNGD
USA,2000,work with members to accomplish this landmark goal.,UNGD
USA,2000,Further improvements in management and,UNGD
USA,2000,peacekeeping and a sounder financial base are a vital,UNGD
USA,2000,step towards a stronger and more effective United,UNGD
USA,2000,Nations. But we must also stand up to the campaign,UNGD
USA,2000,launched by Baghdad against the United Nations,UNGD
USA,2000,authority and international law.,UNGD
USA,2000,Security Council resolution 1284 (1999) provides,UNGD
USA,2000,an effective plan for protecting world security through,UNGD
USA,2000,resumed weapons inspections and monitoring inside,UNGD
USA,2000,Iraq. It has expanded the oil-for-food programme that,UNGD
USA,2000,has delivered $8 billion in humanitarian supplies to,UNGD
USA,2000,"Iraqi civilians, with $6 billion more on the way. And it",UNGD
USA,2000,"would enable Iraq, through compliance with the",UNGD
USA,2000,"resolution's terms, to achieve an early suspension of",UNGD
USA,2000,"sanctions. Thus far, Baghdad has flatly refused to",UNGD
USA,2000,accept the resolution. The regime's strategy is to ignore,UNGD
USA,2000,its United Nations Charter obligations and to seek to,UNGD
USA,2000,preserve at all costs its capacity to produce the,UNGD
USA,2000,deadliest weapons humanity has ever known.,UNGD
USA,2000,We must continue to do all we can to ease the,UNGD
USA,2000,hardships faced by Iraq's people. But we must also,UNGD
USA,2000,"defend the integrity of this institution, our security and",UNGD
USA,2000,international law.,UNGD
USA,2000,The Millennium Summit illustrated the United,UNGD
USA,2000,Nations long-standing role as a forum for articulating,UNGD
USA,2000,consensus goals. But achieving these objectives will,UNGD
USA,2000,"require action at all levels, from local to global. It will",UNGD
USA,2000,also require a willingness to move well beyond the,UNGD
USA,2000,limits and habits of the past.,UNGD
USA,2000,"Today, the United Nations is taking on a wide",UNGD
USA,2000,"array of new issues, what I call “people issues”,",UNGD
USA,2000,because they so directly affect the lives of our citizens.,UNGD
USA,2000,They include the challenge of protecting our planet by,UNGD
USA,2000,limiting greenhouse gas emissions; securing safe water,UNGD
USA,2000,supplies; halting desertification; and putting a stop to,UNGD
USA,2000,trafficking in human beings. They especially include,UNGD
USA,2000,"the fight against HIV/AIDS, which was highlighted in",UNGD
USA,2000,a letter to the Secretary-General signed by the women,UNGD
USA,2000,Foreign Ministers last night. These and similar,UNGD
USA,2000,challenges are sure to be important components of,UNGD
USA,2000,"twenty-first century diplomacy, and because they are",UNGD
USA,2000,"global in scope, require a global response.",UNGD
USA,2000,The United Nations is also playing an increased,UNGD
USA,2000,role in areas where cold war divisions once held it,UNGD
USA,2000,"back. Over the past decade, United Nations entities",UNGD
USA,2000,"have contributed much by prosecuting war criminals,",UNGD
USA,2000,"promoting democracy, supporting human rights and",UNGD
USA,2000,aiding the fight against illegal drugs.,UNGD
USA,2000,"These issues require a willingness to take a stand,",UNGD
USA,2000,as the United Nations has done in holding accountable,UNGD
USA,2000,the perpetrators of ethnic cleansing in Rwanda and the,UNGD
USA,2000,Balkans; striving to end rebel outrages in Sierra Leone;,UNGD
USA,2000,and expressing opposition to the long-standing and,UNGD
USA,2000,ongoing violation of basic human rights in Burma.,UNGD
USA,2000,Let me say this morning that when the Burmese,UNGD
USA,2000,"Government tries to blame the victims for the crime,",UNGD
USA,2000,and say that Aung San Suu Kyi and her party are,UNGD
USA,2000,"responsible for their own repression, I can only reply",UNGD
USA,2000,that much the same was once said about Gandhi and,UNGD
USA,2000,"Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela and Václav",UNGD
USA,2000,"Havel. The world is not fooled, and we must not be",UNGD
USA,2000,silent.,UNGD
USA,2000,Some argue that speaking out in defence of,UNGD
USA,2000,human rights constitutes interference in internal affairs.,UNGD
USA,2000,I believe it helps to fulfil the purposes of the United,UNGD
USA,2000,"Nations Charter, because when international norms are",UNGD
USA,2000,"assaulted, the United Nations must do more than",UNGD
USA,2000,"simply observe injustice, or report upon it, or",UNGD
USA,2000,"sympathize with the victims. We must do all we can,",UNGD
USA,2000,"where we can, to stop the perpetrators.",UNGD
USA,2000,This requires the active backing and participation,UNGD
USA,2000,"of United Nations Members, so that respect for",UNGD
USA,2000,international law becomes steadily more universal and,UNGD
USA,2000,the incentives for observing global standards,UNGD
USA,2000,progressively more clear.,UNGD
USA,2000,"The result, if we are united and determined",UNGD
USA,2000,"enough, will be a world of greater security, justice and",UNGD
USA,2000,"peace. Realistically, this is essential, if we are to",UNGD
USA,2000,achieve the ambitious social goals we have set.,UNGD
USA,2000,"But there is one other essential element as well,",UNGD
USA,2000,"and that is democracy. This past summer in Poland, for",UNGD
USA,2000,"the first time, more than 100 nations came together to",UNGD
USA,2000,reaffirm democratic principles and ensure that the,UNGD
USA,2000,democratic tide remains a rising one around the world.,UNGD
USA,2000,We did this not because democracy always,UNGD
USA,2000,"produces good Governments, for it does not. But we",UNGD
USA,2000,are convinced by the evidence of the old century that,UNGD
USA,2000,the hopes we share for the new will more readily be,UNGD
USA,2000,10,UNGD
USA,2000,,UNGD
USA,2000,accomplished if people are able to live and work in,UNGD
USA,2000,freedom.,UNGD
USA,2000,Democracy is the one road we can all walk down,UNGD
USA,2000,together and the best system yet devised for sowing,UNGD
USA,2000,and growing the seeds of economic opportunity.,UNGD
USA,2000,"In promoting democracy, we are not attempting to",UNGD
USA,2000,"impose our values on anyone else. In fact, this is not",UNGD
USA,2000,"possible, because democracy, by definition, enables",UNGD
USA,2000,citizens within a country to shape their own destinies in,UNGD
USA,2000,accordance with their own convictions and ideals.,UNGD
USA,2000,"Make no mistake. In any country, at any time,",UNGD
USA,2000,dictatorship is an imposition. Democracy is a choice.,UNGD
USA,2000,"As we have learned during the last 55 years, the",UNGD
USA,2000,United Nations provides no guarantees of global peace,UNGD
USA,2000,or prosperity. But it can play a vital role as catalyst and,UNGD
USA,2000,"coordinator, and as a bridge connecting the",UNGD
USA,2000,contributions of one to another.,UNGD
USA,2000,"To those who would judge it harshly, I would",UNGD
USA,2000,respond not by pointing first to the deliberations of,UNGD
USA,2000,"diplomats such as myself, in surroundings such as",UNGD
USA,2000,"these. Instead, I would point to the day-to-day efforts",UNGD
USA,2000,"of United Nations workers caring for refugees, feeding",UNGD
USA,2000,"children, providing shelter and preventing disease.",UNGD
USA,2000,I would point to the men and women on the front,UNGD
USA,2000,"lines, from Port-au-Prince to Freetown, and from",UNGD
USA,2000,"Kosovo to Kisangani, doing some of the world's",UNGD
USA,2000,"hardest work, and, as we have been reminded by the",UNGD
USA,2000,recent slayings of employees of the Office of the,UNGD
USA,2000,United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in,UNGD
USA,2000,"East Timor, also the most dangerous. It is their efforts",UNGD
USA,2000,"and sacrifice, in partnership with so many indigenous",UNGD
USA,2000,"and other non-governmental organizations, that truly",UNGD
USA,2000,remind us of the United Nations purpose and of our,UNGD
USA,2000,kinship with one another.,UNGD
USA,2000,"This is, I expect, my last official speech to a",UNGD
USA,2000,"United Nations audience. As I stand before you, I am",UNGD
USA,2000,deeply conscious not only of our many,UNGD
USA,2000,"accomplishments, but also of the tasks not yet",UNGD
USA,2000,completed.,UNGD
USA,2000,"I am grieved by the conflicts that still rage, and",UNGD
USA,2000,the basic rights and freedoms still denied. I am,UNGD
USA,2000,frustrated by the gaps that still exist between our ideals,UNGD
USA,2000,"and actions, and alarmed by the deepening material",UNGD
USA,2000,"divide that ultimately threatens every nation, rich and",UNGD
USA,2000,poor alike.,UNGD
USA,2000,There are those who say it is naïve to think that,UNGD
USA,2000,the future can be made better than the past. I am,UNGD
USA,2000,reminded that this institution was founded by men and,UNGD
USA,2000,women who were as realistic as any human beings,UNGD
USA,2000,"could be, for they were the survivors of the worst",UNGD
USA,2000,conflict our world has known and determined that,UNGD
USA,2000,succeeding generations should be saved from holocaust,UNGD
USA,2000,"and war. They had faith. Surely we, as well, must have",UNGD
USA,2000,faith that by working together within and outside this,UNGD
USA,2000,"Organization, we can move together, step by step",UNGD
USA,2000,"towards the lofty goals we have set, and thereby bring",UNGD
USA,2000,"about a world more peaceful, prosperous and free than",UNGD
USA,2000,"it has ever been. Since 1993, it has been my privilege",UNGD
USA,2000,"to work with so many of you, from every part of the",UNGD
USA,2000,"globe, in support of the interests we have in common",UNGD
USA,2000,and the dreams our people share.,UNGD
USA,2000,"This morning, I want to thank you for your",UNGD
USA,2000,friendship; pledge my cooperation in the months,UNGD
USA,2000,"immediately ahead; and ask respectfully, in turn, for",UNGD
USA,2000,"yours. I promise, as well, to serve the cause of",UNGD
USA,2000,international progress and individual liberty not only,UNGD
USA,2000,"for as long as I am in office, but for as long as I am",UNGD
USA,2000,alive.,UNGD
USA,2001,We meet in a Hall devoted to,UNGD
USA,2001,peace; in a city scarred by violence; in a nation,UNGD
USA,2001,awakened to danger; in a world uniting for a long,UNGD
USA,2001,struggle. Every civilized nation here today is resolved,UNGD
USA,2001,to keep the most basic commitment of civilization. We,UNGD
USA,2001,will defend ourselves and our future against terror and,UNGD
USA,2001,lawless violence.,UNGD
USA,2001,The United Nations was founded in this cause. In,UNGD
USA,2001,"the Second World War, we learned that there is no",UNGD
USA,2001,isolation from evil. We affirmed that some crimes are,UNGD
USA,2001,"so terrible they offend humanity itself, and we resolved",UNGD
USA,2001,that the aggressions and ambitions of the wicked must,UNGD
USA,2001,"be opposed early, decisively and collectively, before",UNGD
USA,2001,they threaten us all.,UNGD
USA,2001,"That evil has returned, and that cause is renewed.",UNGD
USA,2001,"A few miles from here, many thousands still lie in a",UNGD
USA,2001,"tomb of rubble. Tomorrow, the Secretary-General, the",UNGD
USA,2001,President of the General Assembly and I will visit that,UNGD
USA,2001,"site, where the names of every nation and region that",UNGD
USA,2001,lost citizens will be read aloud. If we were to read out,UNGD
USA,2001,"the names of every person who died, it would take",UNGD
USA,2001,more than three hours.,UNGD
USA,2001,"Those names include a citizen of the Gambia,",UNGD
USA,2001,"whose wife spent their fourth wedding anniversary, 12",UNGD
USA,2001,"September, searching in vain for her husband. Those",UNGD
USA,2001,names include a man who supported his wife in,UNGD
USA,2001,"Mexico, sending home money every week. Those",UNGD
USA,2001,names include a young Pakistani who prayed towards,UNGD
USA,2001,Mecca five times a day and who died that day trying to,UNGD
USA,2001,save others.,UNGD
USA,2001,The suffering of 11 September was inflicted on,UNGD
USA,2001,people of many faiths and many nations. All of the,UNGD
USA,2001,"victims, including Muslims, were killed with equal",UNGD
USA,2001,indifference and equal satisfaction by the terrorist,UNGD
USA,2001,leaders.,UNGD
USA,2001,The terrorists are violating the tenets of every,UNGD
USA,2001,"religion, including the one they invoke. Last week, the",UNGD
USA,2001,"sheikh of Al-Azhar University, the world’s oldest",UNGD
USA,2001,"Islamic institution of higher learning, declared that",UNGD
USA,2001,terrorism is a disease and that Islam prohibits killing,UNGD
USA,2001,"innocent civilians. The terrorists call their cause holy,",UNGD
USA,2001,yet they fund it with drug dealing. They encourage,UNGD
USA,2001,murder and suicide in the name of a great faith that,UNGD
USA,2001,forbids both. They dare to ask God’s blessing as they,UNGD
USA,2001,"set out to kill innocent men, women and children. But",UNGD
USA,2001,8,UNGD
USA,2001,,UNGD
USA,2001,the God of Isaac and Ishmael would never answer such,UNGD
USA,2001,a prayer. And a murderer is not a martyr; he is just a,UNGD
USA,2001,murderer.,UNGD
USA,2001,Time is passing. Yet for the United States of,UNGD
USA,2001,"America, there will be no forgetting 11 September. We",UNGD
USA,2001,will remember every rescuer who died in honour. We,UNGD
USA,2001,will remember every family that lives in grief. We will,UNGD
USA,2001,"remember the fire and ash, the last phone calls, the",UNGD
USA,2001,funerals of the children.,UNGD
USA,2001,And the people of my country will remember,UNGD
USA,2001,those who have plotted against us. We are learning,UNGD
USA,2001,their names. We are coming to know their faces. There,UNGD
USA,2001,is no corner of the Earth distant or dark enough to,UNGD
USA,2001,"protect them. However long it takes, their hour of",UNGD
USA,2001,justice will come.,UNGD
USA,2001,Every nation has a stake in this cause. As we,UNGD
USA,2001,"meet, the terrorists are planning more murder —",UNGD
USA,2001,"perhaps in my country, or perhaps, fellow members, in",UNGD
USA,2001,yours. They kill because they aspire to dominate. They,UNGD
USA,2001,seek to overthrow Governments and to destabilize,UNGD
USA,2001,"entire regions. Last week, anticipating this meeting of",UNGD
USA,2001,"the General Assembly, they denounced the United",UNGD
USA,2001,Nations; they called our Secretary-General a criminal,UNGD
USA,2001,and they condemned all Arab nations here as traitors to,UNGD
USA,2001,Islam. Few countries meet their exacting standards of,UNGD
USA,2001,brutality and oppression. Every other country is a,UNGD
USA,2001,potential target.,UNGD
USA,2001,And all the world faces the most horrifying,UNGD
USA,2001,prospect of all: those same terrorists are searching for,UNGD
USA,2001,"weapons of mass destruction, the tools to turn their",UNGD
USA,2001,hatred into holocaust. They can be expected to use,UNGD
USA,2001,"chemical, biological and nuclear weapons the moment",UNGD
USA,2001,they are capable of doing so. No hint of conscience,UNGD
USA,2001,would prevent it. That threat cannot be ignored; that,UNGD
USA,2001,threat cannot be appeased. Civilization itself — the,UNGD
USA,2001,civilization we share — is threatened. History will,UNGD
USA,2001,record our response and will judge or justify every,UNGD
USA,2001,nation in this Hall.,UNGD
USA,2001,The civilized world is now responding. We act to,UNGD
USA,2001,defend ourselves and to deliver our children from a,UNGD
USA,2001,future of fear. We choose the dignity of life over a,UNGD
USA,2001,culture of death. We choose lawful change and civil,UNGD
USA,2001,"disagreement over coercion, subversion and chaos.",UNGD
USA,2001,"Those commitments — hope and order, law and life —",UNGD
USA,2001,unite people across cultures and continents. Upon those,UNGD
USA,2001,commitments depend all peace and progress. For those,UNGD
USA,2001,"commitments, we are determined to fight.",UNGD
USA,2001,The United Nations has risen to this,UNGD
USA,2001,"responsibility: on 12 September, these buildings",UNGD
USA,2001,opened for emergency meetings of the General,UNGD
USA,2001,Assembly and of the Security Council. Before the sun,UNGD
USA,2001,"had set, these attacks on the world stood condemned by",UNGD
USA,2001,"the world, and I want to thank you, fellow members,",UNGD
USA,2001,for that strong and principled stand.,UNGD
USA,2001,I also thank the Arab and Islamic countries that,UNGD
USA,2001,have condemned terrorist murder. Many of you have,UNGD
USA,2001,seen the destruction of terror in your own lands. The,UNGD
USA,2001,terrorists are increasingly isolated by their own hatred,UNGD
USA,2001,and extremism. They cannot hide behind Islam. The,UNGD
USA,2001,authors of mass murder and their allies have no place,UNGD
USA,2001,"in any culture, and no home in any faith.",UNGD
USA,2001,The conspiracies of terror are being answered by,UNGD
USA,2001,an expanding global coalition. Not every nation will be,UNGD
USA,2001,part of every action against the enemy. But every,UNGD
USA,2001,nation in our coalition has duties. Those duties can be,UNGD
USA,2001,"demanding, as we in America are learning. We have",UNGD
USA,2001,already made adjustments in our laws and in our daily,UNGD
USA,2001,lives. We are taking new measures to investigate terror,UNGD
USA,2001,and to protect against threats.,UNGD
USA,2001,The leaders of all nations must now carefully,UNGD
USA,2001,consider their responsibilities and their future. Terrorist,UNGD
USA,2001,groups such as Al Qaeda depend upon the aid or,UNGD
USA,2001,indifference of Governments. They need the support of,UNGD
USA,2001,a financial infrastructure and safe havens to train and,UNGD
USA,2001,plan and hide.,UNGD
USA,2001,Some nations want to play their part in the fight,UNGD
USA,2001,against terror but tell us they lack the means to enforce,UNGD
USA,2001,their laws and control their borders. We stand ready to,UNGD
USA,2001,help.,UNGD
USA,2001,Some Governments still turn a blind eye to the,UNGD
USA,2001,"terrorists, hoping the threat will pass them by. They are",UNGD
USA,2001,mistaken.,UNGD
USA,2001,"And some Governments, while pledging to",UNGD
USA,2001,"uphold the principles of the United Nations, have cast",UNGD
USA,2001,their lot with the terrorists. They support them and,UNGD
USA,2001,harbour them. And they will find that their welcomed,UNGD
USA,2001,guests are parasites that will weaken them and,UNGD
USA,2001,eventually consume them. For every regime that,UNGD
USA,2001,"sponsors terror there is a price to be paid, and it will be",UNGD
USA,2001,paid. The allies of terror are equally guilty of murder,UNGD
USA,2001,and equally accountable to justice.,UNGD
USA,2001,The Taliban are now learning that lesson. That,UNGD
USA,2001,regime and the terrorists who support it are now,UNGD
USA,2001,virtually indistinguishable. Together they promote,UNGD
USA,2001,9,UNGD
USA,2001,,UNGD
USA,2001,terror abroad and impose a reign of terror on the,UNGD
USA,2001,Afghan people. Women are executed in Kabul’s soccer,UNGD
USA,2001,stadium. They can be beaten for wearing socks that are,UNGD
USA,2001,too thin. Men are jailed for missing prayer meetings.,UNGD
USA,2001,"The United States, supported by many nations, is",UNGD
USA,2001,bringing justice to the terrorists in Afghanistan. We are,UNGD
USA,2001,making progress against military targets — and that is,UNGD
USA,2001,"our objective. Unlike the enemy, we seek to minimize,",UNGD
USA,2001,"not maximize, the loss of innocent life. I am proud of",UNGD
USA,2001,the honourable conduct of the American military. And,UNGD
USA,2001,my country grieves for all the suffering the Taliban,UNGD
USA,2001,"have brought upon Afghanistan, including the terrible",UNGD
USA,2001,burden of war.,UNGD
USA,2001,The Afghan people do not deserve their present,UNGD
USA,2001,rulers. Years of Taliban misrule have brought nothing,UNGD
USA,2001,but misery and starvation. Even before this current,UNGD
USA,2001,"crisis, 4 million Afghans depended on food from the",UNGD
USA,2001,"United States and other nations, and millions of",UNGD
USA,2001,Afghans were refugees from Taliban oppression.,UNGD
USA,2001,I make this promise to all the victims of that,UNGD
USA,2001,"regime: the Taliban’s days of harbouring terrorists, and",UNGD
USA,2001,"dealing in heroin, and brutalizing women are drawing",UNGD
USA,2001,"to a close. When that regime is gone, the people of",UNGD
USA,2001,"Afghanistan will say, with the rest of the world, good",UNGD
USA,2001,riddance.,UNGD
USA,2001,"I can promise, too, that America will join the",UNGD
USA,2001,world in helping the people of Afghanistan rebuild,UNGD
USA,2001,their country.,UNGD
USA,2001,"Many nations, including mine, are sending food",UNGD
USA,2001,and medicine to help Afghans through the winter.,UNGD
USA,2001,America has airdropped over 1.3 million packages of,UNGD
USA,2001,"rations in Afghanistan. Just this week, we airlifted",UNGD
USA,2001,"20,000 blankets and over 200 tons of provisions into",UNGD
USA,2001,"the region. We continue to provide humanitarian aid,",UNGD
USA,2001,even while the Taliban try to steal the food we send.,UNGD
USA,2001,"More help, eventually, will be needed. The",UNGD
USA,2001,United States will work closely with the United,UNGD
USA,2001,Nations and development banks to reconstruct,UNGD
USA,2001,Afghanistan after hostilities there have ceased and the,UNGD
USA,2001,Taliban are no longer in control. And the United States,UNGD
USA,2001,will work with the United Nations to support a post-,UNGD
USA,2001,Taliban Government that represents all of the Afghan,UNGD
USA,2001,people.,UNGD
USA,2001,"In this war of terror, each of us must answer for",UNGD
USA,2001,what we have done or what we have left undone. After,UNGD
USA,2001,"tragedy, there is a time for sympathy and condolence.",UNGD
USA,2001,My country has been very grateful for both.,UNGD
USA,2001,The memorials and vigils around the world will,UNGD
USA,2001,not be forgotten. But the time for sympathy has now,UNGD
USA,2001,passed. The time for action has now arrived.,UNGD
USA,2001,The most basic obligations in this new conflict,UNGD
USA,2001,have already been defined by the United Nations. On,UNGD
USA,2001,"28 September, the Security Council adopted resolution",UNGD
USA,2001,1373 (2001). Its requirements are clear: every,UNGD
USA,2001,United Nations Member has a responsibility to crack,UNGD
USA,2001,down on terrorist financing. We must pass all necessary,UNGD
USA,2001,laws in our own countries to allow the confiscation of,UNGD
USA,2001,terrorist assets. We must apply those laws to every,UNGD
USA,2001,financial institution in every nation.,UNGD
USA,2001,We have a responsibility to share intelligence and,UNGD
USA,2001,coordinate the efforts of law enforcement. If you know,UNGD
USA,2001,"something, tell us. If we know something, we will tell",UNGD
USA,2001,"you. And when we find the terrorists, we must work",UNGD
USA,2001,together to bring them to justice.,UNGD
USA,2001,"We have a responsibility to deny any sanctuary,",UNGD
USA,2001,"safe haven, or transit to terrorists. Every known",UNGD
USA,2001,"terrorist camp must be shut down, its operators",UNGD
USA,2001,"apprehended, and evidence of their arrest presented to",UNGD
USA,2001,the United Nations.,UNGD
USA,2001,We have a responsibility to deny weapons to,UNGD
USA,2001,terrorists — and to actively prevent private citizens,UNGD
USA,2001,from providing them.,UNGD
USA,2001,"These obligations are urgent, and they are binding",UNGD
USA,2001,on every nation with a place in this Hall. Many,UNGD
USA,2001,"Governments are taking these obligations seriously,",UNGD
USA,2001,and my country appreciates it. Yet even beyond,UNGD
USA,2001,"resolution 1373 (2001), more is required — and more",UNGD
USA,2001,is expected — of our coalition against terror. We are,UNGD
USA,2001,asking for a comprehensive commitment to this fight.,UNGD
USA,2001,"We must unite in opposing all terrorists, not just",UNGD
USA,2001,"some of them. In this world, there are good causes and",UNGD
USA,2001,"bad causes, and we may disagree on where that line is",UNGD
USA,2001,drawn. Yet there is no such thing as a good terrorist.,UNGD
USA,2001,"No national aspiration, no remembered wrong, can ever",UNGD
USA,2001,justify the deliberate murder of the innocent. Any,UNGD
USA,2001,Government that rejects this principle — trying to pick,UNGD
USA,2001,and choose its terrorist friends — will know the,UNGD
USA,2001,consequences.,UNGD
USA,2001,We must speak the truth about terror. Let us never,UNGD
USA,2001,tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories concerning the,UNGD
USA,2001,attacks of 11 September — malicious lies that attempt,UNGD
USA,2001,"to shift the blame away from the terrorists themselves,",UNGD
USA,2001,away from the guilty. To inflame ethnic hatred is to,UNGD
USA,2001,advance the cause of terror.,UNGD
USA,2001,10,UNGD
USA,2001,,UNGD
USA,2001,The war against terror must not serve as an,UNGD
USA,2001,excuse to persecute ethnic and religious minorities in,UNGD
USA,2001,any country. Innocent people must be allowed to live,UNGD
USA,2001,"their own lives, by their own customs, under their own",UNGD
USA,2001,religion. And every nation must have avenues for the,UNGD
USA,2001,peaceful expression of opinion and dissent. When these,UNGD
USA,2001,"avenues are closed, the temptation to speak through",UNGD
USA,2001,violence grows.,UNGD
USA,2001,We must press on with our agenda for peace and,UNGD
USA,2001,prosperity in every land. My country is pledged to,UNGD
USA,2001,encouraging development and expanding trade. My,UNGD
USA,2001,country is pledged to investing in education and,UNGD
USA,2001,combating AIDS and other infectious diseases around,UNGD
USA,2001,"the world. Following 11 September, these pledges are",UNGD
USA,2001,even more important. In our struggle against hateful,UNGD
USA,2001,"groups that exploit poverty and despair, we must offer",UNGD
USA,2001,an alternative of opportunity and hope.,UNGD
USA,2001,The American Government also stands by its,UNGD
USA,2001,commitment to a just peace in the Middle East. We are,UNGD
USA,2001,working towards a day when two States — Israel and,UNGD
USA,2001,"Palestine — live peacefully together, within secure and",UNGD
USA,2001,"recognized borders, as called for by the Security",UNGD
USA,2001,Council resolutions. We will do all in our power to,UNGD
USA,2001,bring both parties back into negotiations. But peace,UNGD
USA,2001,will come only when all have sworn off — forever —,UNGD
USA,2001,"incitement, violence and terror.",UNGD
USA,2001,"Finally, this struggle is a defining moment for the",UNGD
USA,2001,United Nations itself — and the world needs its,UNGD
USA,2001,principled leadership. It undermines the credibility of,UNGD
USA,2001,"this great institution, for example, when the",UNGD
USA,2001,Commission on Human Rights offers seats to some of,UNGD
USA,2001,the world’s most persistent violators of human rights.,UNGD
USA,2001,"The United Nations depends, above all, on its moral",UNGD
USA,2001,authority — and that authority must be preserved.,UNGD
USA,2001,The steps I have described will not be easy. For,UNGD
USA,2001,"all nations, they will require effort. For some nations,",UNGD
USA,2001,they will require great courage. Yet the cost of inaction,UNGD
USA,2001,is far greater. The only alternative to victory is a,UNGD
USA,2001,nightmare world where every city is a potential killing,UNGD
USA,2001,field.,UNGD
USA,2001,"As I told the American people, freedom and fear",UNGD
USA,2001,"are at war. We face enemies that hate not our policies,",UNGD
USA,2001,but our existence — the tolerance of openness and the,UNGD
USA,2001,creative culture that define us. But the outcome of this,UNGD
USA,2001,conflict is certain.,UNGD
USA,2001,"There is a current in history, and it runs towards",UNGD
USA,2001,"freedom. Our enemies resent it and dismiss it, but the",UNGD
USA,2001,dreams of mankind are defined by liberty — the natural,UNGD
USA,2001,"right to create, and build, and worship, and live in",UNGD
USA,2001,dignity. When men and women are released from,UNGD
USA,2001,"oppression and isolation, they find fulfilment and hope,",UNGD
USA,2001,and they leave poverty by the millions. These,UNGD
USA,2001,"aspirations are lifting up the peoples of Europe, Asia,",UNGD
USA,2001,"Africa and the Americas, and they can lift up all of the",UNGD
USA,2001,Islamic world. We stand for the permanent hopes of,UNGD
USA,2001,"humanity, and those hopes will not be denied.",UNGD
USA,2001,"We are confident, too, that history has an author,",UNGD
USA,2001,who fills time and eternity with his purpose. We know,UNGD
USA,2001,"that evil is real, but good will prevail against it. This is",UNGD
USA,2001,"the teaching of many faiths. And in that assurance, we",UNGD
USA,2001,gain strength for a long journey.,UNGD
USA,2001,It is our task — the task of this generation — to,UNGD
USA,2001,provide the response to aggression and terror. We have,UNGD
USA,2001,"no other choice, because there is no other peace. We",UNGD
USA,2001,"did not ask for this mission, yet there is honour in",UNGD
USA,2001,history’s call. We have a chance to write the story of,UNGD
USA,2001,"our times — a story of courage defeating cruelty, and",UNGD
USA,2001,light overcoming darkness. This calling is worthy of,UNGD
USA,2001,"any life, and worthy of every nation. So let us go",UNGD
USA,2001,"forward — confident, determined and unafraid.",UNGD
USA,2001,,UNGD
USA,2001,,UNGD
USA,2001,,UNGD
USA,2002,We meet one year and one day,UNGD
USA,2002,after a terrorist attack brought grief to my country and,UNGD
USA,2002,"brought grief to many citizens of our world. Yesterday,",UNGD
USA,2002,we remembered the innocent lives taken that terrible,UNGD
USA,2002,morning. Today we turn to the urgent duty of,UNGD
USA,2002,protecting other lives without illusion and without fear.,UNGD
USA,2002,We have accomplished much in the last year — in,UNGD
USA,2002,Afghanistan and beyond. We have much yet to do — in,UNGD
USA,2002,Afghanistan and beyond. Many nations represented,UNGD
USA,2002,"here have joined in the fight against global terror, and",UNGD
USA,2002,the people of the United States are grateful.,UNGD
USA,2002,The United Nations was born in the hope that,UNGD
USA,2002,survived a world war — the hope of a world moving,UNGD
USA,2002,"towards justice, escaping old patterns of conflict and",UNGD
USA,2002,fear. The founding Members resolved that the peace of,UNGD
USA,2002,the world must never again be destroyed by the will,UNGD
USA,2002,and the wickedness of any man. We created the United,UNGD
USA,2002,"Nations Security Council so that, unlike the League of",UNGD
USA,2002,"Nations, our deliberations would be more than talk, our",UNGD
USA,2002,resolutions would be more than wishes. After,UNGD
USA,2002,"generations of deceitful dictators, broken treaties and",UNGD
USA,2002,"squandered lives, we dedicated ourselves to standards",UNGD
USA,2002,"of human dignity, shared by all, and to a system of",UNGD
USA,2002,security defended by all.,UNGD
USA,2002,"Today, these standards, and this security, are",UNGD
USA,2002,challenged.,UNGD
USA,2002,Our commitment to human dignity is challenged,UNGD
USA,2002,by persistent poverty and raging disease. The suffering,UNGD
USA,2002,"is great, and our responsibilities are clear. The United",UNGD
USA,2002,States is joining with the world to supply aid where it,UNGD
USA,2002,"reaches people and lifts up lives, to extend trade and",UNGD
USA,2002,"the prosperity it brings, and to bring medical care",UNGD
USA,2002,where it is desperately needed.,UNGD
USA,2002,As a symbol of our commitment to human,UNGD
USA,2002,"dignity, the United States will return to the United",UNGD
USA,2002,"Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural",UNGD
USA,2002,Organization (UNESCO). This organization has been,UNGD
USA,2002,"reformed, and America will participate fully in its",UNGD
USA,2002,"mission to advance human rights, tolerance and",UNGD
USA,2002,learning.,UNGD
USA,2002,Our common security is challenged by regional,UNGD
USA,2002,"conflicts — ethnic and religious strife that is ancient,",UNGD
USA,2002,"but not inevitable. In the Middle East, there can be no",UNGD
USA,2002,peace for either side without freedom for both sides.,UNGD
USA,2002,America stands committed to an independent and,UNGD
USA,2002,"democratic Palestine, living side by side with Israel in",UNGD
USA,2002,"peace and security. Like all other people, Palestinians",UNGD
USA,2002,deserve a government that serves their interests and,UNGD
USA,2002,listens to their voices. My nation will continue to,UNGD
USA,2002,encourage all parties to step up to their responsibilities,UNGD
USA,2002,as we seek a just and comprehensive settlement to the,UNGD
USA,2002,conflict.,UNGD
USA,2002,"Above all, our principles and our security are",UNGD
USA,2002,challenged today by outlaw groups and regimes that,UNGD
USA,2002,accept no law of morality and have no limit to their,UNGD
USA,2002,violent ambitions. In the attacks on America a year,UNGD
USA,2002,"ago, we saw the destructive intentions of our enemies.",UNGD
USA,2002,"This threat hides within many nations, including my",UNGD
USA,2002,"own. In cells and camps, terrorists are plotting further",UNGD
USA,2002,destruction and are building new bases for their war,UNGD
USA,2002,against civilization. And our greatest fear is that,UNGD
USA,2002,terrorists will find a shortcut to their mad ambitions,UNGD
USA,2002,when an outlaw regime supplies them with the,UNGD
USA,2002,technologies enabling them to kill on a massive scale.,UNGD
USA,2002,"In one place, in one regime, we find all these",UNGD
USA,2002,"dangers, in their most lethal and aggressive forms —",UNGD
USA,2002,exactly the kind of aggressive threat the United Nations,UNGD
USA,2002,"was born to confront. Twelve years ago, Iraq invaded",UNGD
USA,2002,Kuwait without provocation. And the regime's forces,UNGD
USA,2002,were poised to continue their march to seize other,UNGD
USA,2002,countries and their resources. Had Saddam Hussein,UNGD
USA,2002,"been appeased instead of stopped, he would have",UNGD
USA,2002,"endangered the peace and stability of the world. Yet,",UNGD
USA,2002,this aggression was stopped by the might of coalition,UNGD
USA,2002,forces and the will of the United Nations.,UNGD
USA,2002,In order to suspend hostilities and to spare,UNGD
USA,2002,"himself, Iraq's dictator accepted a series of",UNGD
USA,2002,"commitments. The terms were clear to him, and to all.",UNGD
USA,2002,And he agreed to prove that he is complying with every,UNGD
USA,2002,one of those obligations. He has proven instead only,UNGD
USA,2002,his contempt for the United Nations and for all his,UNGD
USA,2002,"pledges. By breaking every pledge, by his deceptions",UNGD
USA,2002,"and by his cruelties, Saddam Hussein has made the",UNGD
USA,2002,case against himself.,UNGD
USA,2002,"In 1991, Security Council resolution 688 (1991)",UNGD
USA,2002,demanded that the Iraqi regime cease at once the,UNGD
USA,2002,"repression of its own people, including the systematic",UNGD
USA,2002,"repression of minorities, which the Council said,",UNGD
USA,2002,“threaten[ed] international peace and security in the,UNGD
USA,2002,region”.,UNGD
USA,2002,"This demand goes ignored. Last year, the United",UNGD
USA,2002,Nations Commission on Human Rights found that Iraq,UNGD
USA,2002,continues to commit extremely grave violations of,UNGD
USA,2002,human rights and that the regime's repression is all,UNGD
USA,2002,pervasive. Tens of thousands of political opponents and,UNGD
USA,2002,7,UNGD
USA,2002,,UNGD
USA,2002,ordinary citizens have been subjected to arbitrary arrest,UNGD
USA,2002,"and imprisonment, summary execution, and torture by",UNGD
USA,2002,"beating, burning, electric shock, starvation, mutilation",UNGD
USA,2002,and rape. Wives are tortured in front of their husbands;,UNGD
USA,2002,children in the presence of their parents; and all of,UNGD
USA,2002,these horrors are concealed from the world by the,UNGD
USA,2002,apparatus of a totalitarian State.,UNGD
USA,2002,"In 1991, the United Nations Security Council,",UNGD
USA,2002,"through its resolutions 686 (1991) and 687 (1991),",UNGD
USA,2002,demanded that Iraq return all prisoners from Kuwait,UNGD
USA,2002,and other lands. Iraq's regime agreed. It broke this,UNGD
USA,2002,promise. Last year the Secretary-General's high-level,UNGD
USA,2002,"coordinator for this issue reported that Kuwaiti, Saudi,",UNGD
USA,2002,"Indian, Syrian, Lebanese, Iranian, Egyptian, Bahraini,",UNGD
USA,2002,and Omani nationals remain unaccounted for — more,UNGD
USA,2002,than 600 people. One American pilot is among them.,UNGD
USA,2002,"In 1991, the United Nations Security Council,",UNGD
USA,2002,"through resolution 687 (1991), demanded that Iraq",UNGD
USA,2002,renounce all involvement with terrorism and permit no,UNGD
USA,2002,terrorist organizations to operate in Iraq. Iraq's regime,UNGD
USA,2002,agreed. It broke this promise. In violation of Security,UNGD
USA,2002,"Council resolution 1373 (2001), Iraq continues to",UNGD
USA,2002,shelter and support terrorist organizations that direct,UNGD
USA,2002,"violence against Iran, Israel, and Western",UNGD
USA,2002,Governments. Iraqi dissidents abroad are targeted for,UNGD
USA,2002,"murder. In 1993, Iraq attempted to assassinate the Emir",UNGD
USA,2002,of Kuwait and a former American President. Iraq's,UNGD
USA,2002,Government openly praised the attacks of 11,UNGD
USA,2002,September. Al-Qaida terrorists have escaped from,UNGD
USA,2002,Afghanistan and are known to be in Iraq.,UNGD
USA,2002,"In 1991, the Iraqi regime agreed to destroy and to",UNGD
USA,2002,stop developing all weapons of mass destruction and,UNGD
USA,2002,"long-range missiles, and to prove to the world it has",UNGD
USA,2002,done so by complying with rigorous inspections. Iraq,UNGD
USA,2002,has broken every aspect of this fundamental pledge.,UNGD
USA,2002,"From 1991 to 1995, the Iraqi regime said it had",UNGD
USA,2002,no biological weapons. After a senior official in its,UNGD
USA,2002,"weapons program defected and exposed this lie, the",UNGD
USA,2002,regime admitted to producing tens of thousands of,UNGD
USA,2002,litres of anthrax and other deadly biological agents for,UNGD
USA,2002,"use in Scud missile warheads, aerial bombs and aircraft",UNGD
USA,2002,spray tanks. United Nations inspectors believe Iraq has,UNGD
USA,2002,produced two to four times the amount of biological,UNGD
USA,2002,agents it declared and has failed to account for more,UNGD
USA,2002,than three metric tons of material that could be used to,UNGD
USA,2002,"produce biological weapons. Right now, Iraq is",UNGD
USA,2002,expanding and improving facilities that were used for,UNGD
USA,2002,the production of biological weapons.,UNGD
USA,2002,United Nations inspections also reveal that Iraq,UNGD
USA,2002,"likely maintains stockpiles of VX, mustard and other",UNGD
USA,2002,"chemical agents, and that the regime is rebuilding and",UNGD
USA,2002,expanding facilities capable of producing chemical,UNGD
USA,2002,weapons.,UNGD
USA,2002,"And in 1995, after four years of deception, Iraq",UNGD
USA,2002,finally admitted that it had had a crash nuclear,UNGD
USA,2002,weapons programme prior to the Gulf war. We know,UNGD
USA,2002,"now that, were it not for that war, the regime in Iraq",UNGD
USA,2002,would likely have possessed a nuclear weapon no later,UNGD
USA,2002,than 1993.,UNGD
USA,2002,"Today, Iraq continues to withhold important",UNGD
USA,2002,information about its nuclear programme: weapons,UNGD
USA,2002,"design, procurement logs, experiment data, an",UNGD
USA,2002,accounting of nuclear materials and documentation of,UNGD
USA,2002,foreign assistance. Iraq employs capable nuclear,UNGD
USA,2002,scientists and technicians. It retains physical,UNGD
USA,2002,infrastructure needed to build a nuclear weapon. Iraq,UNGD
USA,2002,has made several attempts to buy high-strength,UNGD
USA,2002,aluminium tubes used to enrich uranium for a nuclear,UNGD
USA,2002,"weapon. Should Iraq acquire fissile material, it would",UNGD
USA,2002,be able to build a nuclear weapon within a year. And,UNGD
USA,2002,Iraq's State-controlled media have reported numerous,UNGD
USA,2002,meetings between Saddam Hussein and his nuclear,UNGD
USA,2002,"scientists, leaving little doubt about his continued",UNGD
USA,2002,appetite for these weapons.,UNGD
USA,2002,Iraq also possesses a force of Scud-type missiles,UNGD
USA,2002,with ranges beyond the 150 kilometres permitted by the,UNGD
USA,2002,United Nations. Work at testing and production,UNGD
USA,2002,facilities shows that Iraq is building more long-range,UNGD
USA,2002,missiles that can inflict mass death throughout the,UNGD
USA,2002,region.,UNGD
USA,2002,"In 1990, after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the",UNGD
USA,2002,world imposed economic sanctions on Iraq. Those,UNGD
USA,2002,sanctions were maintained after the war to compel the,UNGD
USA,2002,regime's compliance with Security Council resolutions.,UNGD
USA,2002,"In time, Iraq was allowed to use oil revenues to buy",UNGD
USA,2002,"food. Saddam Hussein has subverted that programme,",UNGD
USA,2002,working around the sanctions to buy missile,UNGD
USA,2002,technology and military materials. He blames the,UNGD
USA,2002,"suffering of Iraq's people on the United Nations, even",UNGD
USA,2002,as he uses his oil wealth to build lavish palaces for,UNGD
USA,2002,himself and to buy arms for his country. By refusing to,UNGD
USA,2002,"comply with his own agreements, he bears full guilt for",UNGD
USA,2002,the hunger and misery of innocent Iraqi citizens.,UNGD
USA,2002,"In 1991, Iraq promised United Nations inspectors",UNGD
USA,2002,immediate and unrestricted access to verify Iraq's,UNGD
USA,2002,commitment to rid itself of weapons of mass,UNGD
USA,2002,8,UNGD
USA,2002,,UNGD
USA,2002,destruction and long-range missiles. Iraq broke that,UNGD
USA,2002,"promise, spending seven years deceiving, evading and",UNGD
USA,2002,harassing United Nations inspectors before ceasing,UNGD
USA,2002,cooperation entirely. Just months after the 1991,UNGD
USA,2002,"ceasefire, the Security Council twice renewed its",UNGD
USA,2002,demand that the Iraqi regime cooperate fully with,UNGD
USA,2002,"inspectors, condemning Iraq's serious violations of its",UNGD
USA,2002,obligations. The Security Council again renewed that,UNGD
USA,2002,"demand in 1994 and twice more in 1996, deploring",UNGD
USA,2002,Iraq's clear violations of its obligations. The Security,UNGD
USA,2002,"Council renewed its demand three more times in 1997,",UNGD
USA,2002,"citing flagrant violations, and three more times in",UNGD
USA,2002,"1998, calling Iraq's behaviour totally unacceptable.",UNGD
USA,2002,"And in 1999, the demand was renewed yet again.",UNGD
USA,2002,"As we meet today, it has been almost four years",UNGD
USA,2002,since the last United Nations inspector set foot in,UNGD
USA,2002,Iraq — four years for the Iraqi regime to plan and to,UNGD
USA,2002,build and to test behind the cloak of secrecy. We know,UNGD
USA,2002,that Saddam Hussein pursued weapons of mass murder,UNGD
USA,2002,even when inspectors were in his country. Are we to,UNGD
USA,2002,"assume that he stopped when they left? The history, the",UNGD
USA,2002,logic and the facts lead to one conclusion. Saddam,UNGD
USA,2002,Hussein's regime is a grave and gathering danger. To,UNGD
USA,2002,suggest otherwise is to hope against the evidence. To,UNGD
USA,2002,assume this regime's good faith is to bet the lives of,UNGD
USA,2002,millions and the peace of the world in a reckless,UNGD
USA,2002,gamble. And that is a risk we must not take.,UNGD
USA,2002,We have been more than patient. We have tried,UNGD
USA,2002,sanctions. We have tried the carrot of oil-for-food and,UNGD
USA,2002,the stick of coalition military strikes. But Saddam,UNGD
USA,2002,Hussein has defied all those efforts and continues to,UNGD
USA,2002,develop weapons of mass destruction. The first time we,UNGD
USA,2002,may be completely certain he has nuclear weapons is,UNGD
USA,2002,"when, God forbid, he uses one. We owe it to all our",UNGD
USA,2002,citizens to do everything in our power to prevent that,UNGD
USA,2002,day from coming.,UNGD
USA,2002,The conduct of the Iraqi regime is a threat to the,UNGD
USA,2002,authority of the United Nations and a threat to peace.,UNGD
USA,2002,Iraq has answered a decade of United Nations demands,UNGD
USA,2002,with a decade of defiance. All the world now faces a,UNGD
USA,2002,test and the United Nations a difficult and defining,UNGD
USA,2002,moment. Are Security Council resolutions to be,UNGD
USA,2002,honoured and enforced or cast aside without,UNGD
USA,2002,consequence? Will the United Nations serve the,UNGD
USA,2002,"purpose of its founding, or will it be irrelevant?",UNGD
USA,2002,The United States helped found the United,UNGD
USA,2002,Nations. We want the United Nations to be effective,UNGD
USA,2002,and respected and successful. We want the resolutions,UNGD
USA,2002,of the world's most important multilateral body to be,UNGD
USA,2002,"enforced, and right now those resolutions are being",UNGD
USA,2002,unilaterally subverted by the Iraqi regime. Our,UNGD
USA,2002,partnership of nations can meet the test before us by,UNGD
USA,2002,making clear what we now expect of the Iraqi regime.,UNGD
USA,2002,"If the Iraqi regime wishes peace, it will",UNGD
USA,2002,"immediately and unconditionally forswear, disclose",UNGD
USA,2002,"and remove or destroy all weapons of mass destruction,",UNGD
USA,2002,long-range missiles and all related material.,UNGD
USA,2002,"If the Iraqi regime wishes peace, it will",UNGD
USA,2002,immediately end all support for terrorism and act to,UNGD
USA,2002,"suppress it, as all States are required to do by Security",UNGD
USA,2002,Council resolutions.,UNGD
USA,2002,"If the Iraqi regime wishes peace, it will cease",UNGD
USA,2002,"persecution of its civilian population, including Shia,",UNGD
USA,2002,"Sunnis, Kurds, Turkomans and others — again, as",UNGD
USA,2002,required by Security Council resolutions.,UNGD
USA,2002,"If the Iraqi regime wishes peace, it will release or",UNGD
USA,2002,account for all Gulf war personnel whose fate is still,UNGD
USA,2002,unknown. It will return the remains of any who are,UNGD
USA,2002,"deceased, return stolen property, accept liability for",UNGD
USA,2002,losses resulting from the invasion of Kuwait and fully,UNGD
USA,2002,cooperate with international efforts to resolve those,UNGD
USA,2002,"issues, as required by Security Council resolutions.",UNGD
USA,2002,"If the Iraqi regime wishes peace, it will",UNGD
USA,2002,immediately end all illicit trade outside the oil-for-food,UNGD
USA,2002,programme. It will accept United Nations,UNGD
USA,2002,"administration of funds from that programme, to ensure",UNGD
USA,2002,that the money is used fairly and promptly for the,UNGD
USA,2002,benefit of the Iraqi people.,UNGD
USA,2002,"If all those steps are taken, it will signal a new",UNGD
USA,2002,openness and accountability in Iraq. And it could open,UNGD
USA,2002,the prospect of the United Nations helping to build a,UNGD
USA,2002,Government that represents all Iraqis — a Government,UNGD
USA,2002,"based on respect for human rights, economic liberty",UNGD
USA,2002,and internationally supervised elections.,UNGD
USA,2002,The United States has no quarrel with the Iraqi,UNGD
USA,2002,people. They have suffered too long in silent captivity.,UNGD
USA,2002,Liberty for the Iraqi people is a great moral cause and a,UNGD
USA,2002,great strategic goal. The people of Iraq deserve it. The,UNGD
USA,2002,security of all nations requires it.,UNGD
USA,2002,Free societies do not intimidate through cruelty,UNGD
USA,2002,"and conquest, and open societies do not threaten the",UNGD
USA,2002,world with mass murder. The United States supports,UNGD
USA,2002,political and economic liberty in a unified Iraq.,UNGD
USA,2002,9,UNGD
USA,2002,,UNGD
USA,2002,"We can harbour no illusions, and that is important",UNGD
USA,2002,today to remember. Saddam Hussein attacked Iran in,UNGD
USA,2002,1980 and Kuwait in 1990. He has fired ballistic,UNGD
USA,2002,"missiles at Iran and Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Israel.",UNGD
USA,2002,His regime once ordered the killing of every person,UNGD
USA,2002,between the ages of 15 and 70 in certain Kurdish,UNGD
USA,2002,villages in northern Iraq. He has gassed many Iranians,UNGD
USA,2002,and 40 Iraqi villages.,UNGD
USA,2002,My nation will work with the Security Council to,UNGD
USA,2002,meet our common challenge. If Iraq's regime defies us,UNGD
USA,2002,"again, the world must move deliberately and decisively",UNGD
USA,2002,to hold Iraq to account. We will work with the Security,UNGD
USA,2002,Council for the necessary resolutions. But the purposes,UNGD
USA,2002,of the United States should not be doubted. The,UNGD
USA,2002,"Security Council resolutions will be enforced, and the",UNGD
USA,2002,"just demands of peace and security will be met, or",UNGD
USA,2002,"action will be unavoidable, and a regime that has lost",UNGD
USA,2002,its legitimacy will also lose its power.,UNGD
USA,2002,Events can turn in one of two ways.,UNGD
USA,2002,"If we fail to act in the face of danger, the people",UNGD
USA,2002,of Iraq will continue to live in brutal submission. The,UNGD
USA,2002,"regime will have new power to bully, dominate and",UNGD
USA,2002,"conquer its neighbours, condemning the Middle East to",UNGD
USA,2002,more years of bloodshed and fear. The region will,UNGD
USA,2002,"remain unstable, with little hope of freedom, and",UNGD
USA,2002,isolated from the progress of our times. With every step,UNGD
USA,2002,the Iraqi regime takes towards gaining and deploying,UNGD
USA,2002,"the most terrible weapons, our own options to confront",UNGD
USA,2002,that regime will narrow. And if an emboldened regime,UNGD
USA,2002,"were to supply these weapons to terrorist allies, then",UNGD
USA,2002,the attacks of 11 September would be a prelude to far,UNGD
USA,2002,greater horrors.,UNGD
USA,2002,"If we meet our responsibilities, if we overcome",UNGD
USA,2002,"this danger, we can arrive at a very different future.",UNGD
USA,2002,The people of Iraq can shake off their captivity. They,UNGD
USA,2002,can one day join a democratic Afghanistan and a,UNGD
USA,2002,"democratic Palestine, inspiring reforms throughout the",UNGD
USA,2002,Muslim world. These nations can show by their,UNGD
USA,2002,"example that honest government, respect for women,",UNGD
USA,2002,and the great Islamic tradition of learning can triumph,UNGD
USA,2002,in the Middle East and beyond. We will show that the,UNGD
USA,2002,promise of the United Nations can be fulfilled in our,UNGD
USA,2002,time.,UNGD
USA,2002,Neither of these outcomes is certain. Both have,UNGD
USA,2002,been set before us. We must choose between a world of,UNGD
USA,2002,fear and a world of progress. We cannot stand by and,UNGD
USA,2002,do nothing while dangers gather. We must stand up for,UNGD
USA,2002,our security and for the permanent rights and hopes of,UNGD
USA,2002,"mankind. By heritage and by choice, the United States",UNGD
USA,2002,of America will make that stand. Representatives to the,UNGD

USA,2003,Between those alternatives there is no neutral,UNGD

USA,2003,favourable judgement of history.,UNGD
USA,2003,The former regimes of Afghanistan and Iraq knew,UNGD
USA,2003,those alternatives and made their choices. The Taliban,UNGD
USA,2003,was a sponsor and servant of terrorism. When,UNGD

USA,2003,terror while it built weapons of mass destruction. It,UNGD
USA,2003,used those weapons in acts of mass murder and refused,UNGD
USA,2003,to account for them when confronted by the world. The,UNGD
USA,2003,Security Council was right to be alarmed. The Security,UNGD

USA,2003,Those permanent commitments call us to great work in,UNGD
USA,2003,"the world, work that we must do together. So, let us",UNGD
USA,2003,"move forward. First, we must stand with the people of",UNGD
USA,2003,Afghanistan and Iraq as they build free and stable,UNGD
USA,2003,countries. The terrorists and their allies fear and fight,UNGD
USA,2003,this progress above all because free people embrace,UNGD
USA,2003,hope over resentment and choose peace over violence.,UNGD
USA,2003,The United Nations has been a friend of the,UNGD
USA,2003,"Afghan people, distributing food and medicine, helping",UNGD
USA,2003,"refugees return home, advising on a new constitution",UNGD
USA,2003,10,UNGD
USA,2003,,UNGD
USA,2003,and helping to prepare the way for nationwide,UNGD
USA,2003,elections. NATO has taken over the United Nations,UNGD
USA,2003,mandated security force in Kabul. American and,UNGD
USA,2003,coalition forces continue to track and defeat al Qaeda,UNGD
USA,2003,terrorists and the remnants of the Taliban. Our efforts,UNGD
USA,2003,to rebuild that country go on. I have recently proposed,UNGD
USA,2003,to spend an additional $1.2 billion for the Afghan,UNGD
USA,2003,"reconstruction effort, and I urge other nations to",UNGD
USA,2003,continue contributing to that important cause.,UNGD
USA,2003,"In the nation of Iraq, the United Nations is",UNGD
USA,2003,carrying out vital and effective work every day. By the,UNGD
USA,2003,"end of 2004, more than 90 per cent of Iraqi children",UNGD
USA,2003,under age five will have been immunized against,UNGD
USA,2003,"preventable diseases such as polio, tuberculosis and",UNGD
USA,2003,"measles, thanks to the hard work and high ideals of",UNGD
USA,2003,"UNICEF. Iraq's food distribution system is operational,",UNGD
USA,2003,"delivering nearly a half million tons of food per month,",UNGD
USA,2003,thanks to the skill and expertise of the World Food,UNGD
USA,2003,Programme.,UNGD
USA,2003,Our international coalition in Iraq is meeting its,UNGD
USA,2003,responsibilities. We are conducting precision raids,UNGD
USA,2003,against terrorists and holdouts of the former regime.,UNGD
USA,2003,Those killers are at war with the Iraqi people. They,UNGD
USA,2003,have made Iraq the central front in the war on terror.,UNGD
USA,2003,And they will be defeated. Our coalition has made sure,UNGD
USA,2003,that Iraq's former dictator will never again use,UNGD
USA,2003,weapons of mass destruction. We are now interviewing,UNGD
USA,2003,Iraqi citizens and analysing records of the old regime,UNGD
USA,2003,to reveal the full extent of its weapons programmes and,UNGD
USA,2003,its long campaign of deception. We are training Iraqi,UNGD
USA,2003,"police, border guards and a new army so that the Iraqi",UNGD
USA,2003,people can assume full responsibility for their own,UNGD
USA,2003,security.,UNGD
USA,2003,"At the same time, our coalition is helping to",UNGD
USA,2003,improve the daily lives of the Iraqi people. The old,UNGD
USA,2003,"regime built palaces while letting schools decay, so we",UNGD
USA,2003,are rebuilding more than a thousand schools. The old,UNGD
USA,2003,"regime starved hospitals of resources, so we have",UNGD
USA,2003,helped to supply and reopen hospitals across Iraq. The,UNGD
USA,2003,old regime built up armies and weapons while allowing,UNGD
USA,2003,"the nation's infrastructure to crumble, so we are",UNGD
USA,2003,"rehabilitating power plants, water and sanitation",UNGD
USA,2003,"facilities, bridges and airports. I have proposed to",UNGD
USA,2003,Congress that the United States provide additional,UNGD
USA,2003,"funding for our work in Iraq, the greatest financial",UNGD
USA,2003,commitment of its kind since the Marshall Plan.,UNGD
USA,2003,"Having helped to liberate Iraq, we will honour",UNGD
USA,2003,"our pledges to Iraq, and by helping the Iraqi people",UNGD
USA,2003,build a stable and peaceful country we will make our,UNGD
USA,2003,own countries more secure.,UNGD
USA,2003,The primary goal of our coalition in Iraq is self-,UNGD
USA,2003,"government for the people of Iraq, reached by an",UNGD
USA,2003,orderly and democratic process. That process must,UNGD
USA,2003,"unfold according to the needs of Iraqis, neither hurried",UNGD
USA,2003,nor delayed by the wishes of other parties. And the,UNGD
USA,2003,United Nations can contribute greatly to the cause of,UNGD
USA,2003,Iraqi self-government.,UNGD
USA,2003,America is working with friends and allies on a,UNGD
USA,2003,"new Security Council resolution, which will expand the",UNGD
USA,2003,United Nation's role in Iraq. As in the aftermath of,UNGD
USA,2003,"other conflicts, the United Nations should assist in",UNGD
USA,2003,"developing a constitution, training civil servants and",UNGD
USA,2003,conducting free and fair elections. Iraq now has a,UNGD
USA,2003,"Governing Council, the first truly representative",UNGD
USA,2003,institution in that country. Iraq's new leaders are,UNGD
USA,2003,showing the openness and tolerance that democracy,UNGD
USA,2003,"requires, and they are also showing courage. Yet every",UNGD
USA,2003,young democracy needs the help of friends. Now the,UNGD
USA,2003,"nation of Iraq needs and deserves our aid, and all",UNGD
USA,2003,nations of good will should step forward and provide,UNGD
USA,2003,that support.,UNGD
USA,2003,The success of a free Iraq will be watched and,UNGD
USA,2003,noted throughout the region. Millions will see that,UNGD
USA,2003,"freedom, equality and material progress are possible at",UNGD
USA,2003,the heart of the Middle East. Leaders in the region will,UNGD
USA,2003,face the clearest evidence that free institutions and,UNGD
USA,2003,open societies are the only path to long-term national,UNGD
USA,2003,success and dignity. And a transformed Middle East,UNGD
USA,2003,would benefit the entire world by undermining the,UNGD
USA,2003,ideologies that export violence to other lands.,UNGD
USA,2003,Iraq as a dictatorship had great power to,UNGD
USA,2003,destabilize the Middle East. Iraq as a democracy will,UNGD
USA,2003,have great power to inspire the Middle East. The,UNGD
USA,2003,advance of democratic institutions in Iraq is setting an,UNGD
USA,2003,"example that others, including the Palestinian people,",UNGD
USA,2003,would be wise to follow. The Palestinian cause is,UNGD
USA,2003,betrayed by leaders who cling to power by feeding old,UNGD
USA,2003,hatreds and destroying the good work of others. The,UNGD
USA,2003,Palestinian people deserve their own State. They will,UNGD
USA,2003,gain that State by embracing new leaders committed to,UNGD
USA,2003,"reform, to fighting terror and to building peace.",UNGD
USA,2003,All parties in the Middle East must meet their,UNGD
USA,2003,responsibilities and carry out the commitments they,UNGD
USA,2003,made at Aqaba. Israel must work to create the,UNGD
USA,2003,conditions that will allow a peaceful Palestinian State,UNGD
USA,2003,to emerge. Arab nations must cut off funding and other,UNGD
USA,2003,11,UNGD
USA,2003,,UNGD
USA,2003,support for terrorist organizations. America will work,UNGD
USA,2003,with every nation in the region that acts boldly for the,UNGD
USA,2003,sake of peace.,UNGD
USA,2003,A second challenge we must confront together is,UNGD
USA,2003,the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.,UNGD
USA,2003,"Outlaw regimes that possess nuclear, chemical and",UNGD
USA,2003,biological weapons and the means to deliver them,UNGD
USA,2003,would be able to use blackmail and create chaos in,UNGD
USA,2003,entire regions. Those weapons could be used by,UNGD
USA,2003,terrorists to bring sudden disaster and suffering on a,UNGD
USA,2003,scale we can scarcely imagine. The deadly combination,UNGD
USA,2003,"of outlaw regimes, terror networks and weapons of",UNGD
USA,2003,mass murder is a peril that cannot be ignored or wished,UNGD
USA,2003,"away. If such a danger is allowed to fully materialize,",UNGD
USA,2003,"all words, all protests, will come too late.",UNGD
USA,2003,Nations of the world must have the wisdom and,UNGD
USA,2003,the will to stop grave threats before they arrive. One,UNGD
USA,2003,crucial step is to secure the most dangerous materials at,UNGD
USA,2003,"their source. For more than a decade, the United States",UNGD
USA,2003,has worked with Russia and other States of the former,UNGD
USA,2003,"Soviet Union to dismantle, destroy or secure weapons",UNGD
USA,2003,and dangerous materials left over from another era.,UNGD
USA,2003,"Last year in Canada, the G-8 nations agreed to",UNGD
USA,2003,"provide up to 20 billion dollars, half of it from the",UNGD
USA,2003,"United States, to fight this proliferation risk over the",UNGD
USA,2003,"next ten years. Since then, six additional countries have",UNGD
USA,2003,"joined the effort. More are needed, and I urge other",UNGD
USA,2003,nations to help us meet this danger.,UNGD
USA,2003,We are also improving our capability to interdict,UNGD
USA,2003,lethal materials in transit. Through our Proliferation,UNGD
USA,2003,"Security Initiative, eleven nations are preparing to",UNGD
USA,2003,"search planes, ships, trains and trucks carrying suspect",UNGD
USA,2003,cargo and to seize weapons or missile shipments that,UNGD
USA,2003,raise proliferation concerns. These nations have agreed,UNGD
USA,2003,on a set of interdiction principles consistent with,UNGD
USA,2003,"current legal authorities, and we are working to expand",UNGD
USA,2003,the Proliferation Security Initiative to other countries.,UNGD
USA,2003,We are determined to keep the world's most destructive,UNGD
USA,2003,weapons away from all our shores and out of the hands,UNGD
USA,2003,of our common enemies.,UNGD
USA,2003,Because proliferators will use any route or,UNGD
USA,2003,"channel that is open to them, we need the broadest",UNGD
USA,2003,possible cooperation to stop them. Today I ask the,UNGD
USA,2003,United Nations Security Council to adopt a new,UNGD
USA,2003,antiproliferation resolution. That resolution should call,UNGD
USA,2003,on all Members of the United Nations to criminalize,UNGD
USA,2003,"the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, to",UNGD
USA,2003,enact strict export controls consistent with international,UNGD
USA,2003,standards and to secure any and all sensitive materials,UNGD
USA,2003,within their own borders. The United States stands,UNGD
USA,2003,ready to help any nation draft these new laws and to,UNGD
USA,2003,assist in their enforcement.,UNGD
USA,2003,A third challenge we share is a challenge to our,UNGD
USA,2003,conscience. We must act decisively to meet the,UNGD
USA,2003,humanitarian crises of our time. The United States has,UNGD
USA,2003,begun to carry out the Emergency Plan for AIDS,UNGD
USA,2003,"Relief, aimed at preventing AIDS on a massive scale",UNGD
USA,2003,and treating millions who have the disease already. We,UNGD
USA,2003,have pledged 15 billion dollars over five years to fight,UNGD
USA,2003,AIDS around the world.,UNGD
USA,2003,My country is acting to save lives from famine as,UNGD
USA,2003,well. We are providing more than 1.4 billion dollars in,UNGD
USA,2003,"global emergency food aid, and I have asked our",UNGD
USA,2003,United States Congress for 200 million dollars for a,UNGD
USA,2003,new famine fund so that we can act quickly when the,UNGD
USA,2003,first signs of famine appear. Every nation on every,UNGD
USA,2003,continent should generously add their resources to the,UNGD
USA,2003,fight against disease and desperate hunger.,UNGD
USA,2003,"There is another humanitarian crisis, spreading,",UNGD
USA,2003,"yet hidden from view. Each year, an estimated eight to",UNGD
USA,2003,"nine hundred thousand human beings are bought, sold",UNGD
USA,2003,or forced across the world's borders. Among them are,UNGD
USA,2003,hundreds of thousands of teenage girls and others as,UNGD
USA,2003,young as five who fall victim to the sex trade. This,UNGD
USA,2003,commerce in human life generates billions of dollars,UNGD
USA,2003,"each year, much of which is used to finance organized",UNGD
USA,2003,crime. There is a special evil in the abuse and,UNGD
USA,2003,exploitation of the most innocent and vulnerable. The,UNGD
USA,2003,victims of the sex trade see little of life before they see,UNGD
USA,2003,the very worst of life   an underground of brutality,UNGD
USA,2003,and lonely fear. Those who create these victims and,UNGD
USA,2003,profit from their suffering must be severely punished.,UNGD
USA,2003,Those who patronize this industry debase themselves,UNGD
USA,2003,"and deepen the misery of others, and Governments that",UNGD
USA,2003,tolerate this trade are tolerating a form of slavery.,UNGD
USA,2003,This problem has appeared in my own country,UNGD
USA,2003,"and we are working to stop it. The Protect Act, which I",UNGD
USA,2003,"signed into law this year, makes it a crime for any",UNGD
USA,2003,person to enter the United States or for any citizen to,UNGD
USA,2003,travel abroad for the purpose of sex tourism involving,UNGD
USA,2003,children. The Department of Justice is actively,UNGD
USA,2003,"investigating sex tour operators and patrons, who can",UNGD
USA,2003,face up to 30 years in prison. Under the Trafficking,UNGD
USA,2003,"Victims Protection Act, the United States is using",UNGD
USA,2003,sanctions against Governments to discourage human,UNGD
USA,2003,trafficking.,UNGD
USA,2003,12,UNGD
USA,2003,,UNGD
USA,2003,The victims of this industry also need help from,UNGD
USA,2003,Members of the United Nations. This begins with clear,UNGD
USA,2003,standards and the certainty of punishment under the,UNGD
USA,2003,"laws of every country. Today, some nations make it a",UNGD
USA,2003,crime to sexually abuse children abroad. Such conduct,UNGD
USA,2003,should be a crime in all nations. Governments should,UNGD
USA,2003,inform travellers of the harm this industry does and the,UNGD
USA,2003,severe punishments that will fall on its patrons. The,UNGD
USA,2003,American Government is committing $50 million to,UNGD
USA,2003,support the good work of organizations that are,UNGD
USA,2003,rescuing women and children from exploitation and,UNGD
USA,2003,"giving them shelter, medical treatment and the hope of",UNGD
USA,2003,a new life. I urge other Governments to do their part.,UNGD
USA,2003,We must show new energy in fighting back an old,UNGD
USA,2003,evil. Nearly two centuries after the abolition of the,UNGD
USA,2003,transatlantic slave trade and more than a century after,UNGD
USA,2003,"slavery was officially ended in its last strongholds, the",UNGD
USA,2003,trade in human beings for any purpose must not be,UNGD
USA,2003,allowed to thrive in our time.,UNGD
USA,2003,All the challenges I have spoken of this morning,UNGD
USA,2003,require urgent attention and moral clarity. Helping,UNGD
USA,2003,Afghanistan and Iraq to succeed as free nations in a,UNGD
USA,2003,transformed region; cutting off the avenues of,UNGD
USA,2003,proliferation; abolishing modern forms of slavery  ,UNGD
USA,2003,these are the kinds of great tasks for which the United,UNGD
USA,2003,"Nations was founded. In each case, careful discussion",UNGD
USA,2003,"is needed and, also, decisive action. Our good",UNGD
USA,2003,intentions will be credited only if we achieve good,UNGD
USA,2003,outcomes. As an original signer of the United Nations,UNGD
USA,2003,"Charter, the United States of America is committed to",UNGD
USA,2003,the United Nations and we show that commitment by,UNGD
USA,2003,working to fulfil the United Nations stated purposes,UNGD
USA,2003,and by giving meaning to its ideals.,UNGD
USA,2003,The founding documents of the United Nations,UNGD
USA,2003,and the founding documents of America stand in the,UNGD
USA,2003,same tradition. Both assert that human beings should,UNGD
USA,2003,"never be reduced to objects of power or commerce,",UNGD
USA,2003,because their dignity is inherent. Both recognize a,UNGD
USA,2003,"moral law that stands above men and nations, but",UNGD
USA,2003,which must be defended and enforced by men and,UNGD
USA,2003,nations. And both point the way to peace   the peace,UNGD
USA,2003,that comes when all are free. We secure that peace with,UNGD
USA,2003,our courage and we must show that courage together.,UNGD
USA,2003,,UNGD
USA,2003,,UNGD
USA,2003,,UNGD
USA,2004,Thank you for the honour of,UNGD
USA,2004,addressing the General Assembly. The American,UNGD
USA,2004,people respect the idealism that gave life to this,UNGD
USA,2004,Organization. And we respect the men and women of,UNGD
USA,2004,"the United Nations, who stand for peace and human",UNGD
USA,2004,rights in every part of the world. Welcome to New,UNGD
USA,2004,"York City, and welcome to the United States of",UNGD
USA,2004,America.,UNGD
USA,2004,"During the past three years, I have addressed the",UNGD
USA,2004,"General Assembly in a time of tragedy for my country,",UNGD
USA,2004,and in times of decision for all of us. Now we gather at,UNGD
USA,2004,a time of tremendous opportunity for the United,UNGD
USA,2004,"Nations and for all peaceful nations. For decades, the",UNGD
USA,2004,"circle of liberty, security and development has been",UNGD
USA,2004,expanding in our world. This progress has brought,UNGD
USA,2004,"unity to Europe, self-government to Latin America and",UNGD
USA,2004,Asia and new hope to Africa. Now we have the historic,UNGD
USA,2004,8,UNGD
USA,2004,,UNGD
USA,2004,"chance to widen the circle even further, to fight",UNGD
USA,2004,radicalism and terror with justice and dignity and to,UNGD
USA,2004,"achieve a true peace, founded on human freedom.",UNGD
USA,2004,The United Nations and my country share the,UNGD
USA,2004,deepest commitments. Both the American Declaration,UNGD
USA,2004,of Independence and the Universal Declaration of,UNGD
USA,2004,Human Rights proclaim the equal value and dignity of,UNGD
USA,2004,every human life. That dignity is honoured by the rule,UNGD
USA,2004,"of law, limits on the power of the State, respect for",UNGD
USA,2004,"women, protection of private property, free speech,",UNGD
USA,2004,equal justice and religious tolerance. That dignity is,UNGD
USA,2004,"dishonoured by oppression, corruption, tyranny,",UNGD
USA,2004,"bigotry, terrorism and all violence against the innocent.",UNGD
USA,2004,Both our founding documents affirm that this bright,UNGD
USA,2004,line between justice and injustice — between right and,UNGD
USA,2004,"wrong — is the same in every age, every culture and",UNGD
USA,2004,every nation.,UNGD
USA,2004,Wise Governments also stand for these principles,UNGD
USA,2004,for very practical and realistic reasons. We know that,UNGD
USA,2004,"dictators are quick to choose aggression, while free",UNGD
USA,2004,nations strive to resolve differences in peace. We know,UNGD
USA,2004,"that oppressive Governments support terror, while free",UNGD
USA,2004,Governments fight the terrorists in their midst. We,UNGD
USA,2004,"know that free peoples embrace progress and life,",UNGD
USA,2004,instead of becoming the recruits for murderous,UNGD
USA,2004,ideologies.,UNGD
USA,2004,Every nation that wants peace will share the,UNGD
USA,2004,benefits of a freer world. And every nation that seeks,UNGD
USA,2004,peace has an obligation to help build that world.,UNGD
USA,2004,Eventually there is no safe isolation from terror,UNGD
USA,2004,"networks, or failed States that shelter them, or outlaw",UNGD
USA,2004,regimes or weapons of mass destruction. Eventually,UNGD
USA,2004,"there is no safety in looking away, seeking the quiet",UNGD
USA,2004,life by ignoring the struggles and oppression of others.,UNGD
USA,2004,In this young century our world needs a new,UNGD
USA,2004,definition of security. Our security is not merely found,UNGD
USA,2004,in spheres of influence or some balance of power. The,UNGD
USA,2004,security of our world is found in the advancing rights,UNGD
USA,2004,of mankind.,UNGD
USA,2004,Those rights are advancing across the world. And,UNGD
USA,2004,"across the world, the enemies of human rights are",UNGD
USA,2004,responding with violence. Terrorists and their allies,UNGD
USA,2004,believe the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and,UNGD
USA,2004,the United States Bill of Rights and every charter of,UNGD
USA,2004,liberty ever written are lies to be burned and destroyed,UNGD
USA,2004,and forgotten. They believe that dictators should,UNGD
USA,2004,control every mind and tongue in the Middle East and,UNGD
USA,2004,beyond. They believe that suicide and torture and,UNGD
USA,2004,murder are fully justified to serve any goal they,UNGD
USA,2004,declare. And they act on their beliefs.,UNGD
USA,2004,In the last year alone terrorists have attacked,UNGD
USA,2004,police stations and banks and commuter trains and,UNGD
USA,2004,synagogues and a school filled with children. This,UNGD
USA,2004,month in Beslan we saw once again how the terrorists,UNGD
USA,2004,measure their success in the death of the innocent and,UNGD
USA,2004,in the pain of grieving families. Svetlana Dzebisov was,UNGD
USA,2004,held hostage along with her son and her nephew. Her,UNGD
USA,2004,nephew did not survive. She recently visited the,UNGD
USA,2004,cemetery and saw what she called the “little graves”.,UNGD
USA,2004,"She said, “I understand that there is evil in the world,",UNGD
USA,2004,but what have these little creatures done?”,UNGD
USA,2004,The Russian children did nothing to deserve such,UNGD
USA,2004,awful suffering and fright and death. The people of,UNGD
USA,2004,Madrid and Jerusalem and Istanbul and Baghdad have,UNGD
USA,2004,done nothing to deserve sudden and random murder.,UNGD
USA,2004,Those acts violate the standards of justice in all,UNGD
USA,2004,cultures and the principles of all religions. All civilized,UNGD
USA,2004,nations are in this struggle together and all must fight,UNGD
USA,2004,the murderers.,UNGD
USA,2004,We are determined to destroy terror networks,UNGD
USA,2004,"wherever they operate, and the United States is grateful",UNGD
USA,2004,"to every nation that is helping to seize terrorist assets,",UNGD
USA,2004,track down their operatives and disrupt their plans. We,UNGD
USA,2004,"are determined to end the State sponsorship of terror,",UNGD
USA,2004,and my nation is grateful to all that participated in the,UNGD
USA,2004,liberation of Afghanistan. We are determined to,UNGD
USA,2004,prevent proliferation and to enforce the demands of the,UNGD
USA,2004,"world, and my nation is grateful to the soldiers of many",UNGD
USA,2004,nations who have helped to deliver the Iraqi people,UNGD
USA,2004,from an outlaw dictator.,UNGD
USA,2004,"The dictator agreed in 1991, as a condition of a",UNGD
USA,2004,"ceasefire, to fully comply with all Security Council",UNGD
USA,2004,"resolutions, then ignored more than a decade of those",UNGD
USA,2004,"resolutions. Finally, the Security Council promised",UNGD
USA,2004,serious consequences for his defiance. The,UNGD
USA,2004,commitments we make must have meaning. When we,UNGD
USA,2004,"say “serious consequences”, for the sake of peace there",UNGD
USA,2004,must be serious consequences. So a coalition of nations,UNGD
USA,2004,enforced the just demands of the world.,UNGD
USA,2004,"Defending our ideals is vital, but it is not enough.",UNGD
USA,2004,Our broader mission as United Nations Members is to,UNGD
USA,2004,apply those ideals to the great issues of our time. Our,UNGD
USA,2004,wider goal is to promote hope and progress as the,UNGD
USA,2004,alternatives to hatred and violence. Our great purpose,UNGD
USA,2004,is to build a better world beyond the war on terror.,UNGD
USA,2004,9,UNGD
USA,2004,,UNGD
USA,2004,"Because we believe in human dignity, the United",UNGD
USA,2004,States and many other nations have established a,UNGD
USA,2004,"Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.",UNGD
USA,2004,In three years the contributing countries have funded,UNGD
USA,2004,"projects in more than 90 countries, and pledged a total",UNGD
USA,2004,of $5.6 billion to those efforts. America has undertaken,UNGD
USA,2004,a $15 billion effort to provide prevention and treatment,UNGD
USA,2004,"and humane care in nations afflicted by AIDS, placing",UNGD
USA,2004,a special focus on 15 countries where the need is most,UNGD
USA,2004,"urgent. AIDS is the greatest health crisis of our time,",UNGD
USA,2004,and our unprecedented commitment will bring new,UNGD
USA,2004,hope to those who have walked too long in the shadow,UNGD
USA,2004,of death.,UNGD
USA,2004,"Because we believe in human dignity, the United",UNGD

USA,2004,confront the evil of trafficking in human beings. We,UNGD
USA,2004,"are supporting organizations that rescue the victims,",UNGD
USA,2004,passing stronger anti-trafficking laws and warning,UNGD
USA,2004,travellers that they will be held to account for,UNGD
USA,2004,supporting this modern form of slavery. Women and,UNGD
USA,2004,children should never be exploited for pleasure or,UNGD
USA,2004,"greed, anywhere on Earth.",UNGD
USA,2004,"Because we believe in human dignity, we should",UNGD
USA,2004,take seriously the protection of life from exploitation,UNGD
USA,2004,"under any pretext. In this session, the General",UNGD
USA,2004,Assembly will consider a draft resolution sponsored by,UNGD
USA,2004,Costa Rica calling for a comprehensive ban on human,UNGD
USA,2004,cloning. I support that draft resolution and urge all,UNGD
USA,2004,Governments to affirm a basic ethical principle: no,UNGD
USA,2004,human life should ever be produced or destroyed for,UNGD
USA,2004,the benefit of another.,UNGD
USA,2004,"Because we believe in human dignity, the United",UNGD
USA,2004,States and many other nations have changed the way,UNGD
USA,2004,"we fight poverty, curb corruption and provide aid. In",UNGD
USA,2004,"2002 we created the Monterrey Consensus, a bold",UNGD
USA,2004,approach that links new aid from developed nations to,UNGD
USA,2004,real reform in developing ones. And through the,UNGD
USA,2004,"Millennium Challenge Account, my nation is",UNGD
USA,2004,increasing our aid to developing nations that expand,UNGD
USA,2004,economic freedom and invest in the education and,UNGD
USA,2004,health of their own people.,UNGD
USA,2004,"Because we believe in human dignity, the United",UNGD
USA,2004,States and many other nations have acted to lift the,UNGD
USA,2004,crushing burden of debt that limits the growth of,UNGD
USA,2004,developing economies and holds millions of people in,UNGD
USA,2004,"poverty. Since those efforts began in 1996, poor",UNGD
USA,2004,countries with the heaviest debt burdens have received,UNGD
USA,2004,more than $30 billion of relief. And to prevent the,UNGD
USA,2004,"build-up of future debt, my country and other nations",UNGD
USA,2004,have agreed that international financial institutions,UNGD
USA,2004,should increasingly provide new aid in the form of,UNGD
USA,2004,grants rather than loans.,UNGD
USA,2004,"Because we believe in human dignity, the world",UNGD
USA,2004,must have more effective means to stabilize regions in,UNGD
USA,2004,turmoil and to halt religious violence and ethnic,UNGD
USA,2004,cleansing. We must create permanent capabilities to,UNGD
USA,2004,respond to future crises.,UNGD
USA,2004,The United States and Italy have proposed a,UNGD
USA,2004,Global Peace Operations Initiative. Group of Eight,UNGD
USA,2004,"(G-8) countries will train 75,000 peacekeepers —",UNGD
USA,2004,initially from Africa — so they can conduct operations,UNGD
USA,2004,on that continent and elsewhere. The countries of the,UNGD
USA,2004,G-8 will help that peacekeeping force with deployment,UNGD
USA,2004,and logistical needs.,UNGD
USA,2004,"At this hour, the world is witnessing terrible",UNGD
USA,2004,suffering and horrible crimes in the Darfur region of,UNGD
USA,2004,"the Sudan, crimes my Government has concluded are",UNGD
USA,2004,genocide. The United States played a key role in efforts,UNGD
USA,2004,"to broker a ceasefire, and we are providing",UNGD
USA,2004,humanitarian assistance to the Sudanese people.,UNGD
USA,2004,Rwanda and Nigeria have deployed forces in the Sudan,UNGD
USA,2004,to help improve security so that aid can be delivered.,UNGD
USA,2004,The Security Council adopted a new resolution that,UNGD
USA,2004,supports an expanded African Union force to help,UNGD
USA,2004,prevent further bloodshed and that urges the,UNGD
USA,2004,Government of the Sudan to stop flights by military,UNGD
USA,2004,aircraft in Darfur. We congratulate the members of the,UNGD
USA,2004,Council on this timely and necessary action. I call on,UNGD
USA,2004,the Government of the Sudan to honour the ceasefire it,UNGD
USA,2004,"signed, and to stop the killing in Darfur.",UNGD
USA,2004,"Because we believe in human dignity, peaceful",UNGD
USA,2004,nations must stand for the advance of democracy. No,UNGD
USA,2004,other system of government has done more to protect,UNGD
USA,2004,"minorities, to secure the rights of labour, to raise the",UNGD
USA,2004,status of women or to channel human energy to the,UNGD
USA,2004,pursuits of peace. We have witnessed the rise of,UNGD
USA,2004,democratic Governments in predominantly Hindu and,UNGD
USA,2004,"Muslim, Buddhist, Jewish and Christian cultures.",UNGD
USA,2004,Democratic institutions have taken root in modern,UNGD
USA,2004,societies and in traditional societies. When it comes to,UNGD
USA,2004,"the desire for liberty and justice, there is no clash of",UNGD
USA,2004,civilizations. People everywhere are capable of,UNGD
USA,2004,freedom and worthy of freedom.,UNGD
USA,2004,Finding the full promise of representative,UNGD
USA,2004,"Government takes time, as America has found in two",UNGD
USA,2004,centuries of debate and struggle. Nor is there only one,UNGD
USA,2004,10,UNGD
USA,2004,,UNGD
USA,2004,"form of representative Government, because",UNGD
USA,2004,democracies by definition take on the unique character,UNGD
USA,2004,of the peoples that create them. Yet this much we know,UNGD
USA,2004,with certainty: the desire for freedom resides in every,UNGD
USA,2004,"human heart, and that desire cannot be contained",UNGD
USA,2004,forever by prison walls or martial laws or secret police.,UNGD
USA,2004,"Over time and across the Earth, freedom will find a",UNGD
USA,2004,way.,UNGD
USA,2004,Freedom is finding a way in Iraq and,UNGD
USA,2004,"Afghanistan, and we must continue to show our",UNGD
USA,2004,commitment to democracies in those nations. The,UNGD
USA,2004,liberty that many have won at a cost must be secured.,UNGD
USA,2004,"As Members of the United Nations, we all have a stake",UNGD
USA,2004,in the success of the world’s newest democracies. Not,UNGD
USA,2004,"long ago, outlaw regimes in Baghdad and Kabul",UNGD
USA,2004,threatened the peace and sponsored terrorists. Those,UNGD
USA,2004,regimes destabilized one of the world’s most vital and,UNGD
USA,2004,most volatile regions. They brutalized their peoples in,UNGD
USA,2004,defiance of all civilized norms.,UNGD
USA,2004,"Today, the Iraqi and Afghan peoples are on the",UNGD
USA,2004,path to democracy and freedom. The Governments that,UNGD
USA,2004,are rising will pose no threat to others. Instead of,UNGD
USA,2004,"harbouring terrorists, they are fighting terrorist groups.",UNGD
USA,2004,And this progress is good for the long-term security of,UNGD
USA,2004,all of us. The Afghan people are showing extraordinary,UNGD
USA,2004,courage under difficult conditions. They are fighting to,UNGD
USA,2004,defend their nation from Taliban hold-outs and helping,UNGD
USA,2004,to strike against the terrorist killers. They are reviving,UNGD
USA,2004,their economy. They have adopted a Constitution,UNGD
USA,2004,"that protects the rights of all, while honouring their",UNGD
USA,2004,nation’s most cherished traditions. More than 10,UNGD
USA,2004,million Afghan citizens — over four million of them,UNGD
USA,2004,women — are now registered to vote in next month’s,UNGD
USA,2004,presidential election. To any who still would question,UNGD
USA,2004,"whether Muslim societies can be democratic societies,",UNGD
USA,2004,the Afghan people are giving their answer.,UNGD
USA,2004,Since the last general debate of this General,UNGD
USA,2004,"Assembly, the people of Iraq have regained",UNGD
USA,2004,"sovereignty. Today, in this Hall, the Prime Minister of",UNGD
USA,2004,Iraq and his delegation represent a country that has,UNGD
USA,2004,rejoined the community of nations. The Government of,UNGD
USA,2004,Prime Minister Allawi has earned the support of every,UNGD
USA,2004,nation that believes in self-determination and desires,UNGD
USA,2004,peace. And under Security Council resolutions 1511,UNGD
USA,2004,"(2003) and 1546 (2004), the world is providing that",UNGD
USA,2004,support. The United Nations and its Member nations,UNGD
USA,2004,must respond to Prime Minister Allawi’s request and,UNGD
USA,2004,"do more to help build an Iraq that is secure,",UNGD
USA,2004,"democratic, federal and free.",UNGD
USA,2004,A democratic Iraq has ruthless enemies because,UNGD
USA,2004,terrorists know the stakes in that country. They know,UNGD
USA,2004,that a free Iraq in the heart of the Middle East will be a,UNGD
USA,2004,decisive blow against their ambitions for that region.,UNGD
USA,2004,So a terrorist group associated with Al Qaeda is now,UNGD
USA,2004,one of the main groups killing the innocent in Iraq,UNGD
USA,2004,"today, conducting a campaign of bombings against",UNGD
USA,2004,civilians and the beheadings of bound men. Coalition,UNGD
USA,2004,forces now serving in Iraq are confronting the terrorists,UNGD
USA,2004,and foreign fighters so that peaceful nations around the,UNGD
USA,2004,world will never have to face them within our own,UNGD
USA,2004,borders.,UNGD
USA,2004,Our coalition is standing beside a growing Iraqi,UNGD
USA,2004,security force. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization,UNGD
USA,2004,is providing vital training to that force. More than 35,UNGD
USA,2004,nations have contributed money and expertise to help,UNGD
USA,2004,"rebuild Iraq’s infrastructure and, as the Iraqi Interim",UNGD
USA,2004,"Government moves towards national elections,",UNGD
USA,2004,officials from the United Nations are helping Iraqis,UNGD
USA,2004,build the infrastructure of democracy. Those selfless,UNGD
USA,2004,people are doing heroic work and are carrying on the,UNGD
USA,2004,great legacy of Sergio Vieira de Mello.,UNGD
USA,2004,"As we have seen in other countries, one of the",UNGD
USA,2004,"main terrorist goals is to undermine, disrupt and",UNGD
USA,2004,influence election outcomes. We can expect terrorist,UNGD
USA,2004,attacks to escalate as Afghanistan and Iraq approach,UNGD
USA,2004,"national elections. The work ahead is demanding, but",UNGD
USA,2004,those difficulties will not shake our conviction that the,UNGD
USA,2004,future of Afghanistan and Iraq is a future of liberty.,UNGD
USA,2004,The proper response to difficulty is not to retreat — it,UNGD
USA,2004,is to prevail.,UNGD
USA,2004,"The advance of freedom always carries a cost,",UNGD
USA,2004,paid by the bravest among us. America mourns the,UNGD
USA,2004,"losses to our nation and to many others, and today I",UNGD
USA,2004,"assure every friend of Afghanistan and Iraq, and every",UNGD
USA,2004,enemy of liberty: We will stand with the people of,UNGD
USA,2004,Afghanistan and Iraq until their hopes of freedom and,UNGD
USA,2004,security are fulfilled.,UNGD
USA,2004,These two nations will be a model for the broader,UNGD
USA,2004,"Middle East, a region where millions have been denied",UNGD
USA,2004,"basic human rights and simple justice. For too long,",UNGD
USA,2004,"many nations, including my own, tolerated and even",UNGD
USA,2004,excused oppression in the Middle East in the name of,UNGD
USA,2004,"stability. Oppression became common, but stability",UNGD
USA,2004,never arrived. We must take a different approach. We,UNGD
USA,2004,must help the reformers of the Middle East as they,UNGD
USA,2004,work for freedom and strive to build a community of,UNGD
USA,2004,"peaceful, democratic nations.",UNGD
USA,2004,11,UNGD
USA,2004,,UNGD
USA,2004,That commitment to democratic reform is,UNGD
USA,2004,essential to resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict. Peace,UNGD
USA,2004,will not be achieved by Palestinian rulers who,UNGD
USA,2004,"intimidate opposition, tolerate corruption and maintain",UNGD
USA,2004,ties to terrorist groups. The long-suffering Palestinian,UNGD
USA,2004,people deserve better. They deserve true leaders,UNGD
USA,2004,capable of creating and governing a free and peaceful,UNGD
USA,2004,Palestinian State.,UNGD
USA,2004,Even after the setbacks and frustrations of recent,UNGD
USA,2004,"months, good will and hard effort can achieve the",UNGD
USA,2004,promise of the road map to peace. Those who would,UNGD
USA,2004,lead a new Palestinian State should adopt peaceful,UNGD
USA,2004,means to achieve the rights of their people and create,UNGD
USA,2004,the reformed institutions of a stable democracy. Arab,UNGD
USA,2004,"States should end incitement in their own media, cut",UNGD
USA,2004,"off public and private funding for terrorism, and",UNGD
USA,2004,establish normal relations with Israel. Israel should,UNGD
USA,2004,"impose a settlement freeze, dismantle unauthorized",UNGD
USA,2004,"outposts, end the daily humiliation of the Palestinian",UNGD
USA,2004,"people, and avoid any actions that prejudice final",UNGD
USA,2004,negotiations. And world leaders should withdraw all,UNGD
USA,2004,favour and support from any Palestinian ruler who fails,UNGD
USA,2004,his people and betrays their cause.,UNGD
USA,2004,The democratic hopes we see growing in the,UNGD
USA,2004,Middle East are growing everywhere. In the words of,UNGD
USA,2004,the Burmese democracy advocate Aung San Suu Kyi:,UNGD
USA,2004,“We do not accept the notion that democracy is a,UNGD
USA,2004,"Western value. To the contrary, democracy simply",UNGD
USA,2004,"means good Government rooted in responsibility,",UNGD
USA,2004,transparency and accountability.”,UNGD
USA,2004,"Here at the United Nations, Members know this to be",UNGD
USA,2004,"true. In recent years, this Organization has helped",UNGD
USA,2004,create a new democracy in East Timor and the United,UNGD
USA,2004,Nations has aided other nations in making the,UNGD
USA,2004,transition to self-rule.,UNGD
USA,2004,Because I believe that the advance of liberty is,UNGD
USA,2004,"the path to both a safer and better world, today I",UNGD
USA,2004,propose establishing a democracy fund within the,UNGD
USA,2004,United Nations. This is a great calling for this great,UNGD
USA,2004,Organization. The fund would help countries lay the,UNGD
USA,2004,"foundations of democracy by instituting the rule of law,",UNGD
USA,2004,"independent courts, a free press, political parties and",UNGD
USA,2004,trade unions. Money from the fund would also help set,UNGD
USA,2004,up voter precincts and polling places and support the,UNGD
USA,2004,work of election monitors. To show our commitment to,UNGD
USA,2004,"the new democracy fund, the United States will make",UNGD
USA,2004,"an initial contribution, and I urge all other nations to",UNGD
USA,2004,contribute as well.,UNGD
USA,2004,Today I have outlined a broad agenda to advance,UNGD
USA,2004,human dignity and enhance the security of all of us.,UNGD
USA,2004,"The defeat of terror, the protection of human rights, the",UNGD
USA,2004,"spread of prosperity, the advance of democracy —",UNGD
USA,2004,"these causes, these ideals, call us to great work in the",UNGD
USA,2004,world. Each of us alone can only do so much. Together,UNGD
USA,2004,we can accomplish so much more.,UNGD
USA,2004,History will honour the high ideals of this,UNGD
USA,2004,Organization. The Charter states them with clarity: “to,UNGD
USA,2004,save succeeding generations from the scourge of war ...,UNGD
USA,2004,to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights ... to,UNGD
USA,2004,promote social progress and better standards of life in,UNGD
USA,2004,larger freedom”.,UNGD
USA,2004,Let history also record that our generation of,UNGD
USA,2004,"leaders followed through on these ideals, even in",UNGD
USA,2004,"adversity. Let history show that in a decisive decade,",UNGD
USA,2004,members of the United Nations did not grow weary in,UNGD
USA,2004,"our duties, or waver in meeting them. I am confident",UNGD
USA,2004,that this young century will be liberty’s century. I,UNGD
USA,2004,"believe we will rise to this moment, because I know the",UNGD
USA,2004,character of so many nations and leaders represented,UNGD
USA,2004,here today. And I have faith in the transforming power,UNGD
USA,2004,of freedom.,UNGD
USA,2004,May God bless you.,UNGD
USA,2005, On behalf,UNGD
USA,2005,"of President Bush and all of the American people,",UNGD
USA,2005,welcome to New York City.,UNGD
USA,2005,"In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, my fellow",UNGD
USA,2005,citizens have experienced the compassion of the United,UNGD
USA,2005,Nations. I want to thank Secretary-General Annan for,UNGD
USA,2005,mobilizing the support of this institution. I also want to,UNGD
USA,2005,thank the representatives of the 126 countries that have,UNGD
USA,2005,offered assistance in our relief efforts. The United,UNGD
USA,2005,States will never forget their generosity in our time of,UNGD
USA,2005,need.,UNGD
USA,2005,"In moments of tumultuous historical change,",UNGD
USA,2005,leaders must become architects of a better world. We,UNGD
USA,2005,"must survey the new international landscape, lay firm",UNGD
USA,2005,foundations of moral principle and build institutions,UNGD
USA,2005,8,UNGD
USA,2005,,UNGD
USA,2005,that reflect our unique moment in history. It is those,UNGD
USA,2005,institutions that enable citizens of conviction to lead us,UNGD
USA,2005,ever closer to the ideals of justice that stir every soul:,UNGD
USA,2005,"the universal desire for security, prosperity, liberty and",UNGD
USA,2005,dignity.,UNGD
USA,2005,Sixty years ago was just such a time of,UNGD
USA,2005,transformation. After one of the greatest cataclysms in,UNGD
USA,2005,"world history, the United States joined with visionary",UNGD
USA,2005,builders from over 50 countries to create the United,UNGD
USA,2005,Nations. We placed the enduring principles of human,UNGD
USA,2005,rights and fundamental freedoms at the foundation of,UNGD
USA,2005,the United Nations Charter. We built an institution that,UNGD
USA,2005,has helped to support a peaceful world order for six,UNGD
USA,2005,"decades. Today, however, with the end of the cold war",UNGD
USA,2005,and the rise of globalization and the emergence of new,UNGD
USA,2005,"threats, the very terrain of international politics has",UNGD
USA,2005,shifted beneath our feet. In this new world we must,UNGD
USA,2005,again embrace the challenge of building for the future.,UNGD
USA,2005,The time to reform the United Nations is now. We,UNGD
USA,2005,"must seize this opportunity together. Chapter I, Article",UNGD
USA,2005,"1, of the Charter of the United Nations proclaims the",UNGD
USA,2005,"four purposes of the United Nations, great aspirations",UNGD
USA,2005,that have stood the test of time. But consider what,UNGD
USA,2005,"different forms they take today, in 2005, as opposed to",UNGD
USA,2005,"1945, when they were first declared.",UNGD
USA,2005,The first purpose of the United Nations is to help,UNGD
USA,2005,maintain international peace and security. In 1945 the,UNGD
USA,2005,most serious threats to peace and security emerged,UNGD
USA,2005,"between States, and were largely defined by their",UNGD
USA,2005,"borders. Today, however, the greatest threats we face",UNGD
USA,2005,"emerge within States, and melt through their borders:",UNGD
USA,2005,transnational threats like terrorism and the proliferation,UNGD
USA,2005,"of weapons, pandemic disease and trafficking in human",UNGD
USA,2005,beings.,UNGD
USA,2005,"The second purpose of this institution, as written",UNGD
USA,2005,"in the United Nations Charter, is to develop friendly",UNGD
USA,2005,"relations among nations, based on equal rights and the",UNGD
USA,2005,"self-determination of all peoples. In 1945, a life of",UNGD
USA,2005,liberty and dignity was more an aspiration than a,UNGD
USA,2005,"reality for a majority of the world’s people. Today,",UNGD
USA,2005,"however, more nations than ever have enshrined the",UNGD
USA,2005,principles of democracy and human rights — a true,UNGD
USA,2005,moral triumph that will be complete only when all,UNGD
USA,2005,individuals are secure in their basic freedoms.,UNGD
USA,2005,The third purpose of the United Nations is to,UNGD
USA,2005,achieve international cooperation in solving,UNGD
USA,2005,"international problems. In 1945, the fear was that",UNGD
USA,2005,"strong, aggressive States, eager and able to expand",UNGD
USA,2005,"their frontiers with force, would be the primary cause",UNGD
USA,2005,"of international problems. Today, however, it is clear",UNGD
USA,2005,"that weak and poorly governed States, unwilling or",UNGD
USA,2005,"incapable of ruling their countries with justice, are the",UNGD
USA,2005,"principal source of global crises, from civil war and",UNGD
USA,2005,genocide to extreme poverty and humanitarian disaster.,UNGD
USA,2005,"The final purpose of the United Nations, as the",UNGD
USA,2005,"Charter states, is to be a centre for harmonizing the",UNGD
USA,2005,actions of nations in the attainment of common ends.,UNGD
USA,2005,"In 1945, the world’s leaders joined together to build an",UNGD
USA,2005,institutional partnership that could address the shared,UNGD
USA,2005,"challenges of their time. Today, faced with the realities",UNGD
USA,2005,"of a new world, we must transform the United Nations",UNGD
USA,2005,to meet the shared challenges of our time.,UNGD
USA,2005,The Members of this body must work together to,UNGD
USA,2005,strengthen security in a world threatened by stateless,UNGD
USA,2005,"extremists. Today, I call on the nations of the world to",UNGD
USA,2005,ratify the comprehensive convention on terrorism. No,UNGD
USA,2005,"cause, no movement and no grievance can justify the",UNGD
USA,2005,intentional killing of innocent civilians and non-,UNGD
USA,2005,combatants. That is unacceptable by any moral,UNGD
USA,2005,standard. It is time for every Member of the United,UNGD
USA,2005,Nations to outlaw acts of international terrorism.,UNGD
USA,2005,We must also work together to promote,UNGD
USA,2005,prosperity and development in a world of great,UNGD
USA,2005,potential. The United States is committed to the,UNGD
USA,2005,Millennium Development Goals. And at the Monterrey,UNGD
USA,2005,Conference three years ago all nations agreed that,UNGD
USA,2005,development must be a two-way street. Donor,UNGD
USA,2005,countries have a responsibility to increase their,UNGD
USA,2005,assistance to developing nations. And developing,UNGD
USA,2005,"nations have a responsibility to govern justly, advance",UNGD
USA,2005,economic liberty and invest in their people. The,UNGD
USA,2005,Monterrey Consensus is working.,UNGD
USA,2005,"Now is not the time to revert to old, failed",UNGD
USA,2005,thinking about development. Countries representing,UNGD
USA,2005,three quarters of the developing world’s population are,UNGD
USA,2005,on a pace to meet the targets of the Millennium,UNGD
USA,2005,Declaration by 2015.,UNGD
USA,2005,"And, as President Bush said on Wednesday, the",UNGD
USA,2005,United States is prepared to take new action to,UNGD
USA,2005,accelerate this progress: we will eliminate all tariffs,UNGD
USA,2005,and subsidies that distort free trade — as other nations,UNGD
USA,2005,do the same.,UNGD
USA,2005,Members of the United Nations must work,UNGD
USA,2005,together as well to support democracy in a world of,UNGD
USA,2005,"expanding liberty. To advance this common purpose, in",UNGD
USA,2005,9,UNGD
USA,2005,,UNGD
USA,2005,2004 President Bush proposed the creation of a,UNGD
USA,2005,"democracy fund. With the broad support of this body,",UNGD
USA,2005,we have made it a reality. The Fund is now receiving,UNGD
USA,2005,donations in cash and in kind from countries large and,UNGD
USA,2005,small that wish to help other nations lay the,UNGD
USA,2005,foundations of democracy. Showing its leadership as,UNGD
USA,2005,"the world’s largest democracy, India made the generous",UNGD
USA,2005,opening pledge of $10 million.,UNGD
USA,2005,"Now, to be sure, when speaking about democracy,",UNGD
USA,2005,the United States has every reason for humility. After,UNGD
USA,2005,"all, it was only in my lifetime that America guaranteed",UNGD
USA,2005,"the right to vote for all its citizens. Obviously, the path",UNGD
USA,2005,to democracy is long and imperfect and different for,UNGD
USA,2005,every nation. But the principles of democracy are,UNGD
USA,2005,"universal, as is the desire for them. And the United",UNGD
USA,2005,Nations must support every country that embraces the,UNGD
USA,2005,"challenge of self-government. In Afghanistan, Iraq,",UNGD
USA,2005,"Lebanon, the Palestinian territories and throughout the",UNGD
USA,2005,"world, peoples who want to build democracy deserve",UNGD
USA,2005,our help.,UNGD
USA,2005,The many goals we share are great indeed. And,UNGD
USA,2005,the United Nations has a major role to play in their,UNGD
USA,2005,achievement. But for this institution to become an,UNGD
USA,2005,"engine of change in the twenty-first century, it must",UNGD
USA,2005,now change itself. The United Nations must launch a,UNGD
USA,2005,lasting revolution of reform.,UNGD
USA,2005,The United Nations summit declaration,UNGD
USA,2005,"(resolution 60/1), which every head of State endorsed",UNGD
USA,2005,"this week, expresses a global consensus on the fact that",UNGD
USA,2005,reform is imperative. I want to thank former General,UNGD
USA,2005,Assembly President Ping for his tireless hard work.,UNGD
USA,2005,"Our challenge now, under President Eliasson’s",UNGD
USA,2005,"leadership, is to enact the vital reforms that will make",UNGD
USA,2005,"the United Nations more accountable to its Members,",UNGD
USA,2005,more suited to new challenges and more faithful to its,UNGD
USA,2005,founding purposes.,UNGD
USA,2005,The United States welcomes the commitment of,UNGD
USA,2005,all leaders to establish a new Peacebuilding,UNGD
USA,2005,"Commission. Now, we must embrace the difficult task",UNGD
USA,2005,of implementing that vision. A Peacebuilding,UNGD
USA,2005,Commission should plan for post-conflict missions,UNGD
USA,2005,before crises erupt. And it must help to coordinate,UNGD
USA,2005,reconstruction efforts after the fighting stops. In a,UNGD
USA,2005,"world threatened by civil strife, the United Nations",UNGD
USA,2005,needs to be better prepared to help countries rebuild in,UNGD
USA,2005,the aftermath of conflict.,UNGD
USA,2005,We are also pleased that the world’s leaders have,UNGD
USA,2005,recognized the importance of establishing a new,UNGD
USA,2005,Human Rights Council. But it will take a lot of hard,UNGD
USA,2005,work in the coming months to realize that goal. The,UNGD
USA,2005,"Human Rights Council must have fewer members, less",UNGD
USA,2005,"politics and more credibility. And it should never,",UNGD
USA,2005,"never, empower brutal dictatorships to sit in judgement",UNGD
USA,2005,of responsible democracies. The Human Rights,UNGD
USA,2005,Council must have the moral authority to condemn all,UNGD
USA,2005,"violators of human rights, even those that sit among us",UNGD
USA,2005,in this Hall.,UNGD
USA,2005,"Finally, we welcome the promise of the world’s",UNGD
USA,2005,leaders to make the United Nations a more effective,UNGD
USA,2005,and a more principled institution. As President Bush,UNGD
USA,2005,"said on Wednesday (see A/60/PV.2), the United",UNGD
USA,2005,Nations must stand for integrity and live by the high,UNGD
USA,2005,standards it sets for others. For the United Nations to,UNGD
USA,2005,"champion democracy more legitimately, we must",UNGD
USA,2005,increase the transparency and the accountability of this,UNGD
USA,2005,institution. For the United Nations to promote,UNGD
USA,2005,"prosperity more credibly, tougher ethics rules and",UNGD
USA,2005,greater internal oversight are needed to ensure the,UNGD
USA,2005,highest professional standards. And to make the United,UNGD
USA,2005,"Nations relevant to the challenges of today, the purpose",UNGD
USA,2005,and the performance of all United Nations programmes,UNGD
USA,2005,"must be reviewed thoroughly, consistently and",UNGD
USA,2005,comprehensively.,UNGD
USA,2005,Our fellow citizens deserve a United Nations that,UNGD
USA,2005,commands their respect and is worthy of their hard-,UNGD
USA,2005,"earned tax dollars. In a democracy, leaders must be",UNGD
USA,2005,able to justify that their people’s money is indeed being,UNGD
USA,2005,well spent.,UNGD
USA,2005,Real progress on those fundamental reforms will,UNGD
USA,2005,prove that the United Nations can address greater,UNGD
USA,2005,"issues of change, in particular the reform of the",UNGD
USA,2005,Security Council. We want that important body to,UNGD
USA,2005,"reflect the world as it is in 2005, not as it was in 1945.",UNGD
USA,2005,The United States is open to expanding the Security,UNGD
USA,2005,Council. We have long supported a permanent seat for,UNGD
USA,2005,Japan. And we believe that developing countries,UNGD
USA,2005,deserve greater representation on that body. All this,UNGD
USA,2005,would make for a more effective Security Council.,UNGD
USA,2005,And the Security Council must be effective. It,UNGD
USA,2005,must be able to deal with great challenges such as,UNGD
USA,2005,"terrorism and nuclear proliferation, especially when it",UNGD
USA,2005,faces real threats and when countries such as Iran,UNGD
USA,2005,threaten the effectiveness of the global non-,UNGD
USA,2005,proliferation regime. When diplomacy has been,UNGD
USA,2005,10,UNGD
USA,2005,,UNGD
USA,2005,"exhausted, the Security Council must become involved.",UNGD
USA,2005,Questions about Iran’s nuclear activities remain,UNGD
USA,2005,"unanswered, despite repeated efforts by the",UNGD
USA,2005,International Atomic Energy Agency. And after,UNGD
USA,2005,"agreeing to negotiate with Europe, Iran unilaterally",UNGD
USA,2005,walked away from the talks and restarted its nuclear,UNGD
USA,2005,programmes. Iran should return to the negotiations,UNGD
USA,2005,with the European Union three and abandon forever its,UNGD
USA,2005,plans for a nuclear-weapons capability.,UNGD
USA,2005,The experience of recent years has reinforced the,UNGD
USA,2005,universal truth that international institutions are only as,UNGD
USA,2005,strong and effective and relevant as their members,UNGD
USA,2005,choose to make them. The United Nations is no,UNGD
USA,2005,different.,UNGD
USA,2005,The United States believes in a United Nations,UNGD
USA,2005,that is strong and effective. And we have ambitious,UNGD
USA,2005,hopes for its future.,UNGD
USA,2005,"So in this year, as the United Nations marks its",UNGD
USA,2005,"sixtieth anniversary, let us recommit ourselves to",UNGD
USA,2005,principled action. Let us embrace the same spirit of,UNGD
USA,2005,creation that moved the builders and leaders of 1945.,UNGD
USA,2005,And let us reform this great institution to meet the,UNGD
USA,2005,challenges of a new era.,UNGD
USA,2006,I am grateful for the privilege of ,UNGD
USA,2006,speaking to the General Assembly. ,UNGD
USA,2006," Last week, America and the world marked the ",UNGD
USA,2006,fifth anniversary of the attacks that filled another ,UNGD
USA,2006,September morning with death and suffering. On that ,UNGD
USA,2006,"terrible day, extremists killed nearly 3,000 innocent ",UNGD
USA,2006,"people, including citizens of dozens of nations ",UNGD
USA,2006,"represented right here in this Hall. Since then, the ",UNGD
USA,2006,enemies of humanity have continued their campaign of ,UNGD
USA,2006,murder. Al-Qaida and those inspired by its extremist ,UNGD
USA,2006,ideology have attacked more than two dozen nations. ,UNGD
USA,2006,"And recently, a different group of extremists ",UNGD
USA,2006,deliberately provoked a terrible conflict in Lebanon. At ,UNGD
USA,2006,"the start of the twenty-first century, it is clear that the ",UNGD
USA,2006,world is engaged in a great ideological struggle ,UNGD
USA,2006,between extremists who use terror as a weapon to ,UNGD
USA,2006,create fear and moderate people who work for peace. ,UNGD
USA,2006," Five years ago, I stood at this rostrum and called ",UNGD
USA,2006,on the community of nations to defend civilization and ,UNGD
USA,2006,build a more hopeful future. This is still the great ,UNGD
USA,2006,challenge of our time. It is the calling of our ,UNGD
USA,2006,"generation. This morning, I want to speak about the ",UNGD
USA,2006,more hopeful world that is within our reach — a world ,UNGD
USA,2006,"beyond terror, where ordinary men and women are free ",UNGD
USA,2006,"to determine their own destiny, where the voices of ",UNGD
USA,2006,moderation are empowered and where the extremists ,UNGD
USA,2006,are marginalized by the peaceful majority. This world ,UNGD
USA,2006,can be ours if we seek it and if we work together. ,UNGD
USA,2006, The principles of this world beyond terror can be ,UNGD
USA,2006,found in the very first sentence of the Universal ,UNGD
USA,2006,Declaration of Human Rights. This document declares ,UNGD
USA,2006,that the “equal and inalienable rights of all members of ,UNGD
USA,2006,"the human family [are] the foundation of freedom, ",UNGD
USA,2006,justice and peace in the world”. One of the authors of ,UNGD
USA,2006,this document was a Lebanese diplomat named Charles ,UNGD
USA,2006,"Malik, who would go on to become President of this ",UNGD
USA,2006,Assembly. Mr. Malik insisted that these principles ,UNGD
USA,2006,"apply equally to all people, of all religions, in all ",UNGD
USA,2006,regions — including the men and women of the Arab ,UNGD
USA,2006,world that was his home. ,UNGD
USA,2006, In the nearly six decades since that document was ,UNGD
USA,2006,"approved, we have seen the forces of freedom and ",UNGD
USA,2006,moderation transform entire continents. Sixty years ,UNGD
USA,2006,"after a terrible war, Europe is now whole, free and at ",UNGD
USA,2006,"peace, and Asia has seen freedom progress and ",UNGD
USA,2006,hundreds of millions of people lifted out of desperate ,UNGD
USA,2006,poverty. The words of the Universal Declaration are as ,UNGD
USA,2006,true today as they were when they were written. As ,UNGD
USA,2006,"liberty flourishes, nations grow in tolerance, and hope, ",UNGD
USA,2006,and peace. And we are seeing the bright future begin to ,UNGD
USA,2006,take root in the broader Middle East. ,UNGD
USA,2006, Some of the changes in the Middle East have ,UNGD
USA,2006,"been dramatic, and we see the results in this Hall. Five ",UNGD
USA,2006,"years ago, Afghanistan was ruled by the brutal Taliban ",UNGD
USA,2006,"regime, and its seat in this body was contested. Now ",UNGD
USA,2006,this seat is held by the freely elected Government of ,UNGD
USA,2006,"Afghanistan, which is represented today by President ",UNGD
USA,2006,"Karzai. Five years ago, Iraq’s seat in this body was ",UNGD
USA,2006, ,UNGD
USA,2006, ,UNGD
USA,2006,9 06-52731 ,UNGD
USA,2006, ,UNGD
USA,2006,"held by a dictator who killed his citizens, invaded his ",UNGD
USA,2006,neighbours and showed his contempt for the world by ,UNGD
USA,2006,defying more than a dozen Security Council ,UNGD
USA,2006,resolutions. Now Iraq’s seat is held by a democratic ,UNGD
USA,2006,Government that embodies the aspirations of the Iraqi ,UNGD
USA,2006,"people, represented today by President Talabani. With ",UNGD
USA,2006,"these changes, more than 50 million people have been ",UNGD
USA,2006,given a voice in this Hall for the first time in decades. ,UNGD
USA,2006, Some of the changes in the Middle East are ,UNGD
USA,2006,"happening gradually, but they are real. Algeria has held ",UNGD
USA,2006,"its first competitive presidential election, and the ",UNGD
USA,2006,military remained neutral. The United Arab Emirates ,UNGD
USA,2006,recently announced that half of its seats in the Federal ,UNGD
USA,2006,National Council will be chosen by elections. Kuwait ,UNGD
USA,2006,held elections in which women were allowed to vote ,UNGD
USA,2006,and run for office for the first time. Citizens have voted ,UNGD
USA,2006,"in municipal elections in Saudi Arabia, in ",UNGD
USA,2006,parliamentary elections in Jordan and Bahrain and in ,UNGD
USA,2006,multiparty presidential elections in Yemen and in ,UNGD
USA,2006,"Egypt. These are important steps, and the Governments ",UNGD
USA,2006,should continue to move forward with other reforms ,UNGD
USA,2006,that show that they trust their people. Every nation that ,UNGD
USA,2006,"travels the road to freedom moves at a different pace, ",UNGD
USA,2006,and the democracies they build will reflect their own ,UNGD
USA,2006,cultures and traditions. But the destination is the same: ,UNGD
USA,2006,a free society where people live at peace with each ,UNGD
USA,2006,other and at peace with the world. ,UNGD
USA,2006, Some have argued that the democratic changes ,UNGD
USA,2006,we are seeing in the Middle East are destabilizing the ,UNGD
USA,2006,region. This argument rests on a false assumption: that ,UNGD
USA,2006,the Middle East was stable to begin with. The reality is ,UNGD
USA,2006,that the stability we thought we saw in the Middle East ,UNGD
USA,2006,"was a mirage. For decades, millions of men and women ",UNGD
USA,2006,in the region have been trapped in oppression and ,UNGD
USA,2006,hopelessness. And these conditions left a generation ,UNGD
USA,2006,disillusioned and made this region a breeding ground ,UNGD
USA,2006,for extremism. ,UNGD
USA,2006, Imagine what it is like to be a young person ,UNGD
USA,2006,living in a country that is not moving toward reform. ,UNGD
USA,2006,"You are 21 years old, and while your peers in other ",UNGD
USA,2006,parts of the world are casting their ballots for the first ,UNGD
USA,2006,"time, you are powerless to change the course of your ",UNGD
USA,2006,Government. While your peers in other parts of the ,UNGD
USA,2006,world have received educations that prepare them for ,UNGD
USA,2006,"the opportunities of a global economy, you have been ",UNGD
USA,2006,fed propaganda and conspiracy theories that blame ,UNGD
USA,2006,others for your country’s shortcomings. And ,UNGD
USA,2006,"everywhere you turn, you hear extremists who tell you ",UNGD
USA,2006,that you can escape your misery and regain your ,UNGD
USA,2006,dignity through violence and terror and martyrdom. For ,UNGD
USA,2006,"many across the broader Middle East, this is the dismal ",UNGD
USA,2006,choice presented every day. ,UNGD
USA,2006," Every civilized nation, including those in the ",UNGD
USA,2006,"Muslim world, must support those in the region who ",UNGD
USA,2006,are offering a more hopeful alternative. We know that ,UNGD
USA,2006,when people have a voice in their future they are less ,UNGD
USA,2006,likely to blow themselves up in suicide attacks. We ,UNGD
USA,2006,"know that when leaders are accountable to their people, ",UNGD
USA,2006,they are more likely to seek national greatness in the ,UNGD
USA,2006,"achievements of their citizens, rather than in terror and ",UNGD
USA,2006,conquest. So we must stand with democratic leaders ,UNGD
USA,2006,and moderate reformers across the broader Middle ,UNGD
USA,2006,East. We must give voice to the hopes of decent men ,UNGD
USA,2006,and women who want for their children the same things ,UNGD
USA,2006,we want for ours. We must seek stability through a free ,UNGD
USA,2006,and just Middle East where the extremists are ,UNGD
USA,2006,marginalized by millions of citizens in control of their ,UNGD
USA,2006,own destinies. ,UNGD
USA,2006," Today, I would like to speak directly to the ",UNGD
USA,2006,people across the broader Middle East. My country ,UNGD
USA,2006,desires peace. Extremists in your midst spread ,UNGD
USA,2006,propaganda claiming that the West is engaged in a war ,UNGD
USA,2006,"against Islam. This propaganda is false, and its purpose ",UNGD
USA,2006,is to confuse you and justify acts of terror. We respect ,UNGD
USA,2006,"Islam, but we will protect our people from those who ",UNGD
USA,2006,pervert Islam to sow death and destruction. Our goal is ,UNGD
USA,2006,to help you build a more tolerant and hopeful society ,UNGD
USA,2006,that honours people of all faiths and promotes peace. ,UNGD
USA,2006, To the people of Iraq: nearly 12 million of you ,UNGD
USA,2006,braved the car bombers and assassins last December to ,UNGD
USA,2006,vote in free elections. The world saw you hold up ,UNGD
USA,2006,"purple ink-stained fingers, and your courage filled us ",UNGD
USA,2006,with admiration. You have stood firm in the face of ,UNGD
USA,2006,"horrendous acts of terror and sectarian violence, and ",UNGD
USA,2006,we will not abandon you in your struggle to build a ,UNGD
USA,2006,free nation. America and our coalition partners will ,UNGD
USA,2006,continue to stand with the democratic Government you ,UNGD
USA,2006,elected. We will continue to help you secure the ,UNGD
USA,2006,international assistance and investment you need to ,UNGD
USA,2006,"create jobs and opportunity, working with the United ",UNGD
USA,2006,Nations and through the International Compact with ,UNGD
USA,2006,Iraq endorsed here in New York yesterday. We will ,UNGD
USA,2006,continue to train those of you who stepped forward to ,UNGD
USA,2006,fight the enemies of freedom. We will not yield the ,UNGD
USA,2006,future of your country to terrorists and extremists. In ,UNGD
USA,2006,"return, your leaders must rise to the challenges your ",UNGD
USA,2006,country is facing and make difficult choices to bring ,UNGD
USA,2006,"security and prosperity. Working together, we will help ",UNGD
USA,2006,  ,UNGD
USA,2006, ,UNGD
USA,2006,06-52731 10 ,UNGD
USA,2006, ,UNGD
USA,2006,"your democracy succeed, so that it can become a ",UNGD
USA,2006,beacon of hope for millions in the Muslim world. ,UNGD
USA,2006," To the people of Afghanistan: together, we ",UNGD
USA,2006,overthrew the Taliban regime that brought misery into ,UNGD
USA,2006,your lives and harboured terrorists who brought death ,UNGD
USA,2006,"to the citizens of many nations. Since then, we have ",UNGD
USA,2006,watched you choose your leaders in free elections and ,UNGD
USA,2006,build a democratic Government. You can be proud of ,UNGD
USA,2006,these achievements. We respect your courage and your ,UNGD
USA,2006,determination to live in peace and freedom. We will ,UNGD
USA,2006,continue to stand with you to defend your democratic ,UNGD
USA,2006,gains. ,UNGD
USA,2006," Today, forces from more than 40 countries, ",UNGD
USA,2006,"including members of the NATO alliance, are bravely ",UNGD
USA,2006,serving side by side with you against the extremists ,UNGD
USA,2006,who want to bring down the free Government you have ,UNGD
USA,2006,established. We will help you defeat these enemies and ,UNGD
USA,2006,build a free Afghanistan that will never again oppress ,UNGD
USA,2006,you or be a safe haven for terrorists. ,UNGD
USA,2006," To the people of Lebanon: last year, you inspired ",UNGD
USA,2006,the world when you came out into the streets to ,UNGD
USA,2006,demand your independence from Syrian dominance. ,UNGD
USA,2006,You drove Syrian forces from your country and you ,UNGD
USA,2006,"re-established democracy. Since then, you have been ",UNGD
USA,2006,tested by the fighting that began with Hizbollah’s ,UNGD
USA,2006,unprovoked attacks on Israel. Many of you have seen ,UNGD
USA,2006,your homes and your communities caught in crossfire. ,UNGD
USA,2006,"We see your suffering, and the world is helping you to ",UNGD
USA,2006,rebuild your country and helping you deal with the ,UNGD
USA,2006,armed extremists who are undermining your ,UNGD
USA,2006,democracy by acting as a State within a State. ,UNGD
USA,2006, The United Nations has passed a good resolution ,UNGD
USA,2006,"that has authorized an international force, led by ",UNGD
USA,2006,"France and Italy, to help you restore Lebanese ",UNGD
USA,2006,"sovereignty over Lebanese soil. For many years, ",UNGD
USA,2006,Lebanon was a model of democracy and pluralism and ,UNGD
USA,2006,openness in the region — and it will be again. ,UNGD
USA,2006, To the people of Iran: the United States respects ,UNGD
USA,2006,you. We respect your country. We admire your rich ,UNGD
USA,2006,"history, your vibrant culture and your many ",UNGD
USA,2006,contributions to civilization. You deserve an ,UNGD
USA,2006,"opportunity to determine your own future, an economy ",UNGD
USA,2006,that rewards your intelligence and your talents and a ,UNGD
USA,2006,society that allows you to fulfil your tremendous ,UNGD
USA,2006,potential. The greatest obstacle to this future is that ,UNGD
USA,2006,your rulers have chosen to deny you liberty and to use ,UNGD
USA,2006,"your nation’s resources to fund terrorism, and fuel ",UNGD
USA,2006,"extremism, and pursue nuclear weapons. ",UNGD
USA,2006, The United Nations has passed a clear resolution ,UNGD
USA,2006,requiring that the regime in Tehran meet its ,UNGD
USA,2006,international obligations. Iran must abandon its nuclear ,UNGD
USA,2006,"weapons ambitions. Despite what the regime tells you, ",UNGD
USA,2006,we have no objection to Iran’s pursuit of a truly ,UNGD
USA,2006,peaceful nuclear power programme. We are working ,UNGD
USA,2006,"toward a diplomatic solution to this crisis, and as we ",UNGD
USA,2006,"do, we look to the day when you can live in freedom ",UNGD
USA,2006,and America and Iran can be good friends and close ,UNGD
USA,2006,partners in the cause of peace. ,UNGD
USA,2006, To the people of Syria: your land is home to a ,UNGD
USA,2006,great people with a proud tradition of learning and ,UNGD
USA,2006,commerce. Today your rulers have allowed your ,UNGD
USA,2006,country to become a crossroad for terrorism. In your ,UNGD
USA,2006,"midst, Hamas and Hizbollah are working to destabilize ",UNGD
USA,2006,"the region, and your Government is turning your ",UNGD
USA,2006,country into a tool of Iran. This is increasing your ,UNGD
USA,2006,country’s isolation from the world. Your Government ,UNGD
USA,2006,must choose a better way forward by ending its support ,UNGD
USA,2006,"for terror, and living in peace with your neighbours, ",UNGD
USA,2006,and opening the way to a better life for you and your ,UNGD
USA,2006,families. ,UNGD
USA,2006, To the people of Darfur: you have suffered ,UNGD
USA,2006,"unspeakable violence, and my nation has called these ",UNGD
USA,2006,atrocities what they are: genocide. For the last two ,UNGD
USA,2006,"years, America joined with the international ",UNGD
USA,2006,community to provide emergency food aid and support ,UNGD
USA,2006,for an African Union peacekeeping force. Yet your ,UNGD
USA,2006,suffering continues. The world must step forward to ,UNGD
USA,2006,"provide additional humanitarian aid, and we must ",UNGD
USA,2006,strengthen the African Union force that has done good ,UNGD
USA,2006,work but is not strong enough to protect you. The ,UNGD
USA,2006,Security Council has approved a resolution that would ,UNGD
USA,2006,transform the African Union force into a blue-helmeted ,UNGD
USA,2006,force that is larger and more robust. To increase its ,UNGD
USA,2006,"strength and effectiveness, NATO nations should ",UNGD
USA,2006,provide logistics and other support. The regime in ,UNGD
USA,2006,Khartoum is stopping the deployment of this force. If ,UNGD
USA,2006,the Sudanese Government does not approve this ,UNGD
USA,2006,"peacekeeping force quickly, the United Nations must ",UNGD
USA,2006,act. Your lives and the credibility of the United Nations ,UNGD
USA,2006,are at stake. So today I am announcing that I am ,UNGD
USA,2006,naming a presidential Special Envoy — former ,UNGD
USA,2006,Administrator of the United States Agency for ,UNGD
USA,2006,"International Development, Andrew Natsios — to lead ",UNGD
USA,2006,America’s efforts to resolve the outstanding disputes ,UNGD
USA,2006,and help bring peace to your land. ,UNGD
USA,2006, The world must also stand up for peace in the ,UNGD
USA,2006,"Holy Land. I am committed to two democratic States, ",UNGD
USA,2006, ,UNGD
USA,2006, ,UNGD
USA,2006,11 06-52731 ,UNGD
USA,2006, ,UNGD
USA,2006,"Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and ",UNGD
USA,2006,security. I am committed to a Palestinian State that has ,UNGD
USA,2006,territorial integrity and will live peacefully with the ,UNGD
USA,2006,Jewish State of Israel. This is the vision set forth in the ,UNGD
USA,2006,"road map, and helping the parties to reach this goal is ",UNGD
USA,2006,one of the great objectives of my presidency. The ,UNGD
USA,2006,Palestinian people have suffered from decades of ,UNGD
USA,2006,corruption and violence and the daily humiliation of ,UNGD
USA,2006,occupation. Israeli citizens have endured brutal acts of ,UNGD
USA,2006,terrorism and constant fear of attack since the birth of ,UNGD
USA,2006,their nation. Many brave men and women have made ,UNGD
USA,2006,the commitment to peace. Yet extremists in the region ,UNGD
USA,2006,are stirring up hatred and trying to prevent these ,UNGD
USA,2006,moderate voices from prevailing. ,UNGD
USA,2006, This struggle is unfolding in the Palestinian ,UNGD
USA,2006,"territories. Earlier this year, the Palestinian people ",UNGD
USA,2006,voted in a free election. The leaders of Hamas ,UNGD
USA,2006,campaigned on a platform of ending corruption and ,UNGD
USA,2006,"improving the lives of the Palestinian people, and they ",UNGD
USA,2006,prevailed. The world is waiting to see whether the ,UNGD
USA,2006,Hamas Government will follow through on its ,UNGD
USA,2006,promises or pursue an extremist agenda. The world has ,UNGD
USA,2006,sent a clear message to the leaders of Hamas: serve the ,UNGD
USA,2006,"interests of the Palestinian people, abandon terror, ",UNGD
USA,2006,"recognize Israel’s right to exist, honour agreements and ",UNGD
USA,2006,work for peace. ,UNGD
USA,2006, President Abbas is committed to peace and to his ,UNGD
USA,2006,people’s aspirations for a State of their own. Prime ,UNGD
USA,2006,"Minister Olmert is committed to peace, and has said he ",UNGD
USA,2006,intends to meet with President Abbas to make real ,UNGD
USA,2006,progress on the outstanding issues between them. I ,UNGD
USA,2006,believe that peace can be achieved and that a ,UNGD
USA,2006,democratic Palestinian State is possible. I hear from ,UNGD
USA,2006,leaders in the region who want to help. I have directed ,UNGD
USA,2006,Secretary of State Rice to lead a diplomatic effort to ,UNGD
USA,2006,engage moderate leaders across the region to help the ,UNGD
USA,2006,Palestinians reform their security services and support ,UNGD
USA,2006,Israeli and Palestinian leaders in their efforts to come ,UNGD
USA,2006,together to resolve their differences. ,UNGD
USA,2006, Prime Minister Blair has indicated that his ,UNGD
USA,2006,country will work with partners in Europe to help ,UNGD
USA,2006,strengthen the governing institutions of the Palestinian ,UNGD
USA,2006,administration. We welcome his initiative. Countries ,UNGD
USA,2006,"like Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Egypt have made clear ",UNGD
USA,2006,that they are willing to contribute the diplomatic and ,UNGD
USA,2006,financial assistance necessary to help these efforts ,UNGD
USA,2006,"succeed. I am optimistic that, by supporting the forces ",UNGD
USA,2006,"of democracy and moderation, we can help Israelis and ",UNGD
USA,2006,Palestinians build a more hopeful future and achieve ,UNGD
USA,2006,the peace in the Holy Land that we all want. ,UNGD
USA,2006," Freedom, by its nature, cannot be imposed; it ",UNGD
USA,2006,"must be chosen. From Beirut to Baghdad, people are ",UNGD
USA,2006,making the choice for freedom. And the nations ,UNGD
USA,2006,gathered in this Hall must make a choice as well. Will ,UNGD
USA,2006,we support the moderates and reformers who are ,UNGD
USA,2006,"working for change across the Middle East, or will we ",UNGD
USA,2006,yield the future to the terrorists and extremists? ,UNGD
USA,2006,America has made its choice: we will stand with the ,UNGD
USA,2006,moderates and reformers. ,UNGD
USA,2006," Recently, a courageous group of Arab and ",UNGD
USA,2006,"Muslim intellectuals wrote me a letter. In it, they said ",UNGD
USA,2006,this: “The shore of reform is the only one on which any ,UNGD
USA,2006,"lights appear, even though the journey demands ",UNGD
USA,2006,"courage, patience and perseverance”. The United ",UNGD
USA,2006,Nations was created to make that journey possible. ,UNGD
USA,2006,Together we must support the dreams of good and ,UNGD
USA,2006,decent people who are working to transform a troubled ,UNGD
USA,2006,"region. And by doing so, we will advance the high ",UNGD
USA,2006,ideals on which this institution was founded. ,UNGD
USA,2007,Thank you for the opportunity ,UNGD
USA,2007,to address the General Assembly of the United Nations.  ,UNGD
USA,2007," Sixty years ago, representatives from 16 nations ",UNGD
USA,2007,gathered to begin deliberations on a new international ,UNGD
USA,2007,bill of rights. The document they produced is called the ,UNGD
USA,2007,"Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and it stands ",UNGD
USA,2007,as a landmark achievement in the history of human ,UNGD
USA,2007,liberty. The Declaration opens by recognizing the ,UNGD
USA,2007,inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of ,UNGD
USA,2007,all members of the human family as the foundation of ,UNGD
USA,2007,freedom and justice and peace in the world. As we ,UNGD
USA,2007,gather for the sixty-second session of the General ,UNGD
USA,2007,"Assembly, the standards of the Declaration must guide ",UNGD
USA,2007,our work in this world.  ,UNGD
USA,2007, Achieving the promise of the Declaration requires ,UNGD
USA,2007,confronting long-term threats. It also requires ,UNGD
USA,2007,answering the immediate needs of today. ,UNGD
USA,2007," We nations in this Hall have our differences. Yet, ",UNGD
USA,2007,there are some areas where we can all agree. When ,UNGD
USA,2007,innocent people are trapped in a life of murder and ,UNGD
USA,2007,"fear, the Declaration is not being upheld. When ",UNGD
USA,2007,millions of children starve to death or perish from a ,UNGD
USA,2007,"mosquito bite, we are not doing our duty in the world. ",UNGD
USA,2007,When whole societies are cut off from the prosperity of ,UNGD
USA,2007,"the global economy, we are all worse off. Changing ",UNGD
USA,2007,these underlying conditions is what the Declaration ,UNGD
USA,2007,"calls the work of larger freedom, and it must be the ",UNGD
USA,2007,work of every nation in this Assembly. ,UNGD
USA,2007, This great institution must work for great ,UNGD
USA,2007,"purposes, to free people from tyranny and violence, ",UNGD
USA,2007,"hunger and disease, illiteracy and ignorance and ",UNGD
USA,2007,poverty and despair. Every member of the United ,UNGD
USA,2007,Nations must join in this mission of liberation. The ,UNGD
USA,2007,first mission of the United Nations requires liberating ,UNGD
USA,2007,people from tyranny and violence. The first article of ,UNGD
USA,2007,the Universal Declaration begins by stating that all ,UNGD
USA,2007,human beings are born free and equal in dignity and ,UNGD
USA,2007,rights. This truth is denied by terrorists and extremists ,UNGD
USA,2007,who kill the innocent with the aim of imposing their ,UNGD
USA,2007,hateful vision on humanity. The followers of this ,UNGD
USA,2007,violent ideology are a threat to civilized people ,UNGD
USA,2007,everywhere. All civilized nations must work together ,UNGD
USA,2007,to stop them by sharing intelligence about their ,UNGD
USA,2007,networks and choking off their finances and bringing to ,UNGD
USA,2007,"justice their operatives. In the long run, the best way to ",UNGD
USA,2007,defeat extremists is to defeat their dark ideology with a ,UNGD
USA,2007,more hopeful vision   the vision of liberty that ,UNGD
USA,2007,founded this body. ,UNGD
USA,2007, The United States salutes the nations that have ,UNGD
USA,2007,"recently taken strides towards liberty, including ",UNGD
USA,2007,"Ukraine, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Mauritania, Liberia, ",UNGD
USA,2007,Sierra Leone and Morocco. The Palestinian territories ,UNGD
USA,2007,have moderate leaders   mainstream leaders   who ,UNGD
USA,2007,"are working to build free institutions that fight terror, ",UNGD
USA,2007,enforce the law and respond to the needs of their ,UNGD
USA,2007,people. The international community must support ,UNGD
USA,2007,these leaders so that we can advance the vision of two ,UNGD
USA,2007,democratic States   Israel and Palestine   living side ,UNGD
USA,2007,by side in peace and security. ,UNGD
USA,2007, Brave citizens in Lebanon and Afghanistan and ,UNGD
USA,2007,"Iraq have made the choice for democracy. Yet, the ",UNGD
USA,2007,extremists have responded by targeting them for ,UNGD
USA,2007,murder. This is not a show of strength; it is evidence of ,UNGD
USA,2007,fear; and the extremists are doing everything within ,UNGD
USA,2007,their power to bring down these young democracies. ,UNGD
USA,2007,The people of Lebanon and Afghanistan and Iraq have ,UNGD
USA,2007,"asked for our help, and every civilized nation has a ",UNGD
USA,2007,responsibility to stand with them. Every civilized ,UNGD
USA,2007,nation also has a responsibility to stand up for the ,UNGD
USA,2007,"people suffering under dictatorship. In Belarus, North ",UNGD
USA,2007,"Korea, Syria and Iran, brutal regimes deny their people ",UNGD
USA,2007,the fundamental rights enshrined in the Universal ,UNGD
USA,2007,Declaration. ,UNGD
USA,2007, Americans are outraged by the situation in ,UNGD
USA,2007,"Burma, where a military junta has imposed a 19-year ",UNGD
USA,2007,"reign of fear. Basic freedoms of speech, assembly and ",UNGD
USA,2007,worship are severely restricted. Ethnic minorities are ,UNGD
USA,2007,"persecuted. Forced child labour, human trafficking and ",UNGD
USA,2007,rape are common. The regime is holding more than ,UNGD
USA,2007,"1,000 political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi, ",UNGD
USA,2007,whose party was elected overwhelmingly by the ,UNGD
USA,2007,Burmese people in 1990. ,UNGD
USA,2007," The ruling junta remains unyielding, yet the ",UNGD
USA,2007,people’s desire for freedom is unmistakable. This ,UNGD
USA,2007,"morning, I am announcing a series of steps to help ",UNGD
USA,2007,bring peaceful change to Burma. The United States will ,UNGD
USA,2007,tighten economic sanctions on the leaders of the ,UNGD
USA,2007,regime and their financial backers. We will impose an ,UNGD
USA,2007,expanded visa ban on those responsible for the most ,UNGD
USA,2007,egregious violations of human rights   as well as their ,UNGD
USA,2007,family members. We will continue to support the ,UNGD
USA,2007,efforts of humanitarian groups working to alleviate ,UNGD
USA,2007,suffering in Burma. And I urge the United Nations and ,UNGD
USA,2007,all nations to use their diplomatic and economic ,UNGD
USA,2007,leverage to help the Burmese people reclaim their ,UNGD
USA,2007,freedom. ,UNGD
USA,2007," In Cuba, the long rule of a cruel dictator is ",UNGD
USA,2007,nearing its end. The Cuban people are ready for their ,UNGD
USA,2007,freedom. And as that nation enters a period of ,UNGD
USA,2007,"transition, the United Nations must insist on free ",UNGD
USA,2007,"speech, free assembly and, ultimately, free and ",UNGD
USA,2007,competitive elections. ,UNGD
USA,2007," In Zimbabwe, ordinary citizens suffer under a ",UNGD
USA,2007,tyrannical regime. The Government has cracked down ,UNGD
USA,2007,on peaceful calls for reform and has forced millions to ,UNGD
USA,2007,flee their homeland. The behaviour of the Mugabe ,UNGD
USA,2007,regime is an assault on its people and an affront to the ,UNGD
USA,2007,principles of the Universal Declaration. The United ,UNGD
USA,2007,Nations must insist on change in Harare and must insist ,UNGD
USA,2007,on freedom for the people of Zimbabwe. ,UNGD
USA,2007," In Sudan, innocent civilians are suffering ",UNGD
USA,2007,"repression; and in the Darfur region, many are losing ",UNGD
USA,2007,their lives to genocide. America has responded with ,UNGD
USA,2007,tough sanctions against those responsible for the ,UNGD
USA,2007,violence. We have provided more than $2 billion in ,UNGD
USA,2007,humanitarian and peacekeeping aid. I look forward to ,UNGD
USA,2007,attending a Security Council meeting that will focus on ,UNGD
USA,2007,"Darfur, chaired by the French President. I appreciate ",UNGD
USA,2007,France’s leadership in helping to stabilize Sudan’s ,UNGD
USA,2007,neighbours. The United Nations must answer this ,UNGD
USA,2007,challenge to conscience and live up to its promise to ,UNGD
USA,2007,promptly deploy peacekeeping forces to Darfur. ,UNGD
USA,2007," Secondly, the mission of the United Nations ",UNGD
USA,2007,requires liberating people from hunger and disease. ,UNGD
USA,2007,Article 25 of the Universal Declaration states that ,UNGD
USA,2007,everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate ,UNGD
USA,2007,for the health and well-being of himself and of his ,UNGD
USA,2007,"family, including food, clothing, housing, and medical ",UNGD
USA,2007,"care. Around the world, the United Nations is carrying ",UNGD
USA,2007,out noble efforts to live up to these words. ,UNGD
USA,2007, Feeding the hungry has long been a special ,UNGD
USA,2007,"calling for my nation. Today, more than half the ",UNGD
USA,2007,world’s food assistance comes from America. We send ,UNGD
USA,2007,"emergency food stocks to starving people, from camps ",UNGD
USA,2007,in Sudan to slums around the world. I have proposed ,UNGD
USA,2007,an innovative initiative to alleviate hunger under which ,UNGD
USA,2007,America would purchase the crops of local farmers in ,UNGD
USA,2007,"Africa and elsewhere, rather than shipping in food ",UNGD
USA,2007,from the developed world. This would help build up ,UNGD
USA,2007,local agriculture and break the cycle of famine in the ,UNGD
USA,2007,"developing world, and I urge our United States ",UNGD
USA,2007,Congress to support this initiative. ,UNGD
USA,2007, Many in this Hall are bringing the spirit of ,UNGD
USA,2007,generosity to fighting HIV/AIDS and malaria. Five ,UNGD
USA,2007,"years ago, in sub-Saharan Africa, an AIDS diagnosis ",UNGD
USA,2007,"was widely considered a death sentence, and fewer ",UNGD
USA,2007,"than 50,000 people infected with the virus were ",UNGD
USA,2007,receiving treatment. The world responded by creating ,UNGD
USA,2007,"the Global Fund, which is working with Governments ",UNGD
USA,2007,and the private sector to fight the disease around the ,UNGD
USA,2007,world. The United States decided to take these efforts a ,UNGD
USA,2007,step further by launching the $15 billion Emergency ,UNGD
USA,2007,"Plan for AIDS Relief. Since 2003, this effort has ",UNGD
USA,2007,helped bring cutting-edge medicines to more than a ,UNGD
USA,2007,million people in sub-Saharan Africa. It is a good start. ,UNGD
USA,2007,"So earlier this year, I proposed to double our initial ",UNGD
USA,2007,"commitment   to $30 billion. By coming together, the ",UNGD
USA,2007,"world can turn the tide against HIV/AIDS, once and for ",UNGD
USA,2007,all. ,UNGD
USA,2007, Malaria is another common killer. In some ,UNGD
USA,2007,"countries, malaria takes as many lives as HIV/AIDS, ",UNGD
USA,2007,the vast majority of them children under the age of ,UNGD
USA,2007,"five. Every one of these deaths is unnecessary, because ",UNGD
USA,2007,the disease is preventable and treatable. The world ,UNGD
USA,2007,"knows what it takes to stop malaria   bed nets, indoor ",UNGD
USA,2007,spraying and medicine to treat the disease. Two years ,UNGD
USA,2007,"ago, America launched a $1.2 billion malaria initiative. ",UNGD
USA,2007,Other nations and the private sector are making vital ,UNGD
USA,2007,contributions as well. I call on every Member State to ,UNGD
USA,2007,"maintain its focus, to find new ways to join this cause ",UNGD
USA,2007,and to bring us closer to the day when deaths caused by ,UNGD
USA,2007,malaria are no more. ,UNGD
USA,2007," Thirdly, the mission of the United Nations ",UNGD
USA,2007,requires liberating people from the chains of illiteracy ,UNGD
USA,2007,and ignorance. Article 26 of the Universal Declaration ,UNGD
USA,2007,states that everyone has the right to education. When ,UNGD
USA,2007,nations make the investments needed to educate their ,UNGD
USA,2007,"people, the whole world benefits. Better education ",UNGD
USA,2007,unleashes the talent and potential of citizens and adds ,UNGD
USA,2007,to the prosperity of all of us. Better education promotes ,UNGD
USA,2007,better health and greater independence. Better ,UNGD
USA,2007,education increases the strength of democracy and ,UNGD
USA,2007,weakens the appeal of violent ideologies. So the United ,UNGD
USA,2007,States is joining with nations around the world to help ,UNGD
USA,2007,them provide a better education for their people. ,UNGD
USA,2007, A good education starts with good teachers. In ,UNGD
USA,2007,"partnership with other nations, America has helped ",UNGD
USA,2007,"train more than 600,000 teachers and administrators. A ",UNGD
USA,2007,"good education requires good textbooks. So, in ",UNGD
USA,2007,"partnership with other nations, America has distributed ",UNGD
USA,2007,tens of millions of textbooks. A good education ,UNGD
USA,2007,"requires access to good schools. So, in partnership with ",UNGD
USA,2007,"other nations, America is helping nations raise ",UNGD
USA,2007,standards in their schools at home and providing ,UNGD
USA,2007,scholarships to help students come to schools in the ,UNGD
USA,2007,"United States. And in all our education efforts, our ",UNGD
USA,2007,nation is working to expand access for women and ,UNGD
USA,2007,girls so that the opportunity to get a decent education is ,UNGD
USA,2007,open to all. ,UNGD
USA,2007," Finally, the mission of the United Nations ",UNGD
USA,2007,requires liberating people from poverty and despair. ,UNGD
USA,2007,Article 23 of the Universal Declaration states that ,UNGD
USA,2007,"everyone has the right to work, to free choice of ",UNGD
USA,2007,employment and to just and favourable conditions of ,UNGD
USA,2007,"work. In the twenty-first century, this requires ensuring ",UNGD
USA,2007,that people in poor countries have the same ,UNGD
USA,2007,opportunity to benefit from the global economy that ,UNGD
USA,2007,citizens of wealthy countries have. ,UNGD
USA,2007, The United Nations provides vital economic ,UNGD
USA,2007,assistance designed to help developing nations grow ,UNGD
USA,2007,their economies and reach their potential. The United ,UNGD
USA,2007,States agrees with that position. We have dramatically ,UNGD
USA,2007,"increased our own development assistance, and we are ",UNGD
USA,2007,delivering that aid in innovative ways. We started the ,UNGD
USA,2007,Millennium Challenge Account to reward nations that ,UNGD
USA,2007,"govern justly, fight corruption, invest in their people ",UNGD
USA,2007,"and promote economic freedom. With this aid, we are ",UNGD
USA,2007,"reaching out to developing nations in partnership, not ",UNGD
USA,2007,paternalism. And we are ensuring that our aid dollars ,UNGD
USA,2007,reach those who need them and achieve results. ,UNGD
USA,2007," In the long run, the best way to lift people out of ",UNGD
USA,2007,poverty is through trade and investment. A nation that ,UNGD
USA,2007,is open and trading with the world will create ,UNGD
USA,2007,economic rewards that far exceed anything it could get ,UNGD
USA,2007,"through foreign aid. During the 1990s, developing ",UNGD
USA,2007,nations that significantly lowered tariffs saw their per ,UNGD
USA,2007,capita income grow about three times faster than other ,UNGD
USA,2007,"developing countries. Open markets ignite growth, ",UNGD
USA,2007,"encourage investment, increase transparency, ",UNGD
USA,2007,strengthen the rule of law and help countries help ,UNGD
USA,2007,themselves. ,UNGD
USA,2007, The international community now has a historic ,UNGD
USA,2007,chance to open markets around the world by ,UNGD
USA,2007,concluding a successful Doha Round of trade talks. A ,UNGD
USA,2007,successful Doha outcome would mean real and ,UNGD
USA,2007,"substantial openings in agriculture, goods and services, ",UNGD
USA,2007,and real and substantial reductions in trade-distorting ,UNGD
USA,2007,"subsidies. The world’s largest trading nations, ",UNGD
USA,2007,"including major developing countries, have a special ",UNGD
USA,2007,responsibility to make the tough political decisions to ,UNGD
USA,2007,reduce trade barriers. America has the wi11 and ,UNGD
USA,2007,flexibility to make those necessary decisions. Our ,UNGD
USA,2007,negotiators are demonstrating that spirit in Geneva. I ,UNGD
USA,2007,urge other leaders to direct their negotiators to do the ,UNGD
USA,2007,same. And I am optimistic that we can reach a good ,UNGD
USA,2007,Doha agreement and seize this once-in-a-generation ,UNGD
USA,2007,opportunity. ,UNGD
USA,2007," In the meantime, America wi11 continue to ",UNGD
USA,2007,pursue agreements that open trade and investment ,UNGD
USA,2007,wherever we can. We recently signed free-trade ,UNGD
USA,2007,"agreements with Peru, Colombia, Panama and South ",UNGD
USA,2007,Korea. These agreements embody the values of open ,UNGD
USA,2007,"markets, transparent and fair regulation, respect for ",UNGD
USA,2007,private property and resolving disputes under rules of ,UNGD
USA,2007,international law. These are good agreements. They are ,UNGD
USA,2007,"now ready for a congressional vote, and I urge our ",UNGD
USA,2007,Congress to approve them as soon as possible. ,UNGD
USA,2007, As America works with the United Nations to ,UNGD
USA,2007,"alleviate immediate needs, we are also coming together ",UNGD
USA,2007,"to address longer-term challenges. Together, we are ",UNGD
USA,2007,preparing for pandemics that could cause death and ,UNGD
USA,2007,"suffering on a global scale. Together, we are working ",UNGD
USA,2007,to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass ,UNGD
USA,2007,"destruction. Together, we are confronting the ",UNGD
USA,2007,"challenges of energy security, environmental quality ",UNGD
USA,2007,and climate change. I appreciate the discussions on ,UNGD
USA,2007,climate change led by the Secretary-General last night. ,UNGD
USA,2007,I look forward to further discussions at the meeting of ,UNGD
USA,2007,major economies in Washington later this week. ,UNGD
USA,2007, The goals I have outlined today cannot be ,UNGD
USA,2007,"achieved overnight, and they cannot be achieved ",UNGD
USA,2007,without reform of this vital institution. The United ,UNGD
USA,2007,States is committed to a strong and vibrant United ,UNGD
USA,2007,Nations. Yet the American people are disappointed by ,UNGD
USA,2007,the failures of the Human Rights Council. That body ,UNGD
USA,2007,has been silent on repression by regimes from Havana ,UNGD
USA,2007,"and Caracas to Pyongyang and Tehran, while focusing ",UNGD
USA,2007,its criticism excessively on Israel. To be credible on ,UNGD
USA,2007,"human rights in the world, the United Nations must ",UNGD
USA,2007,first reform its own Human Rights Council. ,UNGD
USA,2007, Some have also called for reform of the structure ,UNGD
USA,2007,"of the Security Council, including an expansion of its ",UNGD
USA,2007,membership. The United States is open to this ,UNGD
USA,2007,prospect. We believe that Japan is well qualified for ,UNGD
USA,2007,permanent membership on the Security Council and ,UNGD
USA,2007,that other nations should be considered as well. The ,UNGD
USA,2007,"United States will listen to all good ideas, and we will ",UNGD
USA,2007,support changes to the Security Council as part of ,UNGD
USA,2007,"broader United Nations reform. And in all we do, I call ",UNGD
USA,2007,on Member States to work for an institution that ,UNGD
USA,2007,adheres to strict ethical standards and lives up to the ,UNGD
USA,2007,high principles of the Universal Declaration. ,UNGD
USA,2007, With the commitment and courage of those in this ,UNGD
USA,2007,"Hall, we can build a world where people are free to ",UNGD
USA,2007,"speak, assemble and worship as they wish   a world ",UNGD
USA,2007,"where children in every nation grow up healthy, get a ",UNGD
USA,2007,decent education and look to the future with hope   a ,UNGD
USA,2007,world where opportunity crosses every border. America ,UNGD
USA,2007,"will lead towards that vision, in which all are created ",UNGD
USA,2007,equal and free to pursue their dreams. That is the ,UNGD
USA,2007,founding conviction of my country. It is the promise ,UNGD
USA,2007,"that established this body. And, with our determination, ",UNGD
USA,2007,it can be the future of our world.  ,UNGD
USA,2008,I am pleased to be here to ,UNGD
USA,2008,"address the General Assembly. Sixty-three years ago, ",UNGD
USA,2008,representatives from around the world gathered in San ,UNGD
USA,2008,Francisco to complete the founding of the Charter of ,UNGD
USA,2008,the United Nations. They met in the shadow of a ,UNGD
USA,2008,"devastating war, with grave new dangers on the ",UNGD
USA,2008,horizon. They agreed on a historic pledge to reaffirm ,UNGD
USA,2008,faith in fundamental human rights and unite their ,UNGD
USA,2008,strength to maintain international peace and security. ,UNGD
USA,2008,That noble pledge has endured trying hours in United ,UNGD
USA,2008,"Nations history, and it still guides our work today.  ",UNGD
USA,2008, ,UNGD
USA,2008, ,UNGD
USA,2008,9 08-51570 ,UNGD
USA,2008, ,UNGD
USA,2008, Yet the ideals of the Charter are now facing a ,UNGD
USA,2008,challenge as serious as any since the United Nations ,UNGD
USA,2008,founding: a global movement of violent extremists. By ,UNGD
USA,2008,deliberately murdering the innocent to advance their ,UNGD
USA,2008,"aims, those extremists defy the fundamental principles ",UNGD
USA,2008,of international order. They show contempt for all who ,UNGD
USA,2008,respect life and value human dignity. They reject the ,UNGD
USA,2008,"words of the Bible, the Koran, the Torah or any ",UNGD
USA,2008,standard of conscience of morality. They imperil the ,UNGD
USA,2008,values of justice and human rights that gave birth to the ,UNGD
USA,2008,United Nations — values that have fuelled an ,UNGD
USA,2008,unprecedented expansion of freedom across the world.  ,UNGD
USA,2008, To uphold the words of the Charter in the face of ,UNGD
USA,2008,"this challenge, every nation in this Hall has ",UNGD
USA,2008,"responsibilities. As sovereign States, we have an ",UNGD
USA,2008,obligation to govern responsibly and solve problems ,UNGD
USA,2008,before they spill across borders. We have an obligation ,UNGD
USA,2008,to prevent our territory from being used as a sanctuary ,UNGD
USA,2008,"for terrorism, proliferation, human trafficking and ",UNGD
USA,2008,organized crime. We have an obligation to respect the ,UNGD
USA,2008,rights and respond to the needs of our people.  ,UNGD
USA,2008, Multilateral organizations have responsibilities. ,UNGD
USA,2008,"For eight years, the nations in this Assembly have ",UNGD
USA,2008,worked together to confront the extremist threat. We ,UNGD
USA,2008,"have witnessed successes and setbacks, and through it ",UNGD
USA,2008,all a clear lesson has emerged. The United Nations and ,UNGD
USA,2008,other multilateral organizations are needed more ,UNGD
USA,2008,"urgently than ever. To be successful, we must be ",UNGD
USA,2008,"focused, resolute and effective.  ",UNGD
USA,2008, Instead of only adopting resolutions decrying ,UNGD
USA,2008,"terrorist acts after they occur, we must cooperate more ",UNGD
USA,2008,closely to keep terrorist attacks from happening in the ,UNGD
USA,2008,first place. Instead of treating all forms of Government ,UNGD
USA,2008,"as equally tolerable, we must actively challenge the ",UNGD
USA,2008,conditions of tyranny and despair that allow terror and ,UNGD
USA,2008,extremists to thrive. By acting together to meet the ,UNGD
USA,2008,"fundamental challenge of our time, we can lead ",UNGD
USA,2008,"towards a world that is more secure, more prosperous ",UNGD
USA,2008,and more hopeful.  ,UNGD
USA,2008," In the decades ahead, the United Nations and ",UNGD
USA,2008,other multilateral organizations must continually ,UNGD
USA,2008,confront terror. That mission requires clarity of vision. ,UNGD
USA,2008,We must see the terrorists for what they are: ruthless ,UNGD
USA,2008,"extremists who exploit the desperate, subvert the tenets ",UNGD
USA,2008,of a great religion and seek to impose their will on as ,UNGD
USA,2008,many people as possible. Some suggest that those men ,UNGD
USA,2008,would pose less of a threat if we would only leave ,UNGD
USA,2008,"them alone, yet their leaders make clear that no ",UNGD
USA,2008,concession could ever satisfy their ambitions. Bringing ,UNGD
USA,2008,the terrorists to justice does not create terrorism. It is ,UNGD
USA,2008,the best way to protect our people.  ,UNGD
USA,2008, Multilateral organizations must respond by taking ,UNGD
USA,2008,an unequivocal moral stand against terrorism. No cause ,UNGD
USA,2008,"can justify the deliberate taking of innocent life, and ",UNGD
USA,2008,the international community is nearing universal ,UNGD
USA,2008,agreement on this truth. The vast majority of nations in ,UNGD
USA,2008,this Assembly now agree that tactics like suicide ,UNGD
USA,2008,"bombing, hostage-taking and hijacking are never ",UNGD
USA,2008,legitimate. The Security Council has adopted ,UNGD
USA,2008,resolutions declaring terror unlawful and requiring all ,UNGD
USA,2008,nations to crack down on terrorist financing. Earlier ,UNGD
USA,2008,"this month, the Secretary-General held a conference to ",UNGD
USA,2008,"highlight victims of terror, where he stated that ",UNGD
USA,2008,terrorism can never be justified. ,UNGD
USA,2008, Other multilateral organizations have spoken ,UNGD
USA,2008,clearly as well. The Group of 8 has declared that all ,UNGD
USA,2008,terrorist acts are criminal and must be universally ,UNGD
USA,2008,condemned. The Secretary-General of the Organization ,UNGD
USA,2008,of the Islamic Conference recently spoke out against ,UNGD
USA,2008,"suicide bombing, which he said runs counter to the ",UNGD
USA,2008,teachings of Islam.  ,UNGD
USA,2008, The message behind those statements is ,UNGD
USA,2008,"resolutely clear. Like slavery and piracy, terrorism has ",UNGD
USA,2008,"no place in the modern world. Around the globe, ",UNGD
USA,2008,nations are turning those words into action. Members ,UNGD
USA,2008,of the United Nations are sharing intelligence with one ,UNGD
USA,2008,"another, conducting joint operations and freezing ",UNGD
USA,2008,terrorists’ finances. While terrorists continue to carry ,UNGD
USA,2008,out attacks like the terrible bombing in Islamabad last ,UNGD
USA,2008,"week, our joint actions have spared our citizens from ",UNGD
USA,2008,many devastating blows.  ,UNGD
USA,2008, The brutal nature of the extremists is increasingly ,UNGD
USA,2008,clear and the coalition of nations confronting terrorists ,UNGD
USA,2008,"is growing stronger. Over the past seven years, ",UNGD
USA,2008,Afghanistan and Iraq have been transformed from ,UNGD
USA,2008,regimes that actively sponsor terror to democracies that ,UNGD
USA,2008,fight terror. Libya has renounced its support for terror ,UNGD
USA,2008,and its pursuit of nuclear weapons. Nations like Saudi ,UNGD
USA,2008,Arabia and Pakistan are actively pursuing the terrorists. ,UNGD
USA,2008,"A few nations, regimes like Syria and Iran, continue to ",UNGD
USA,2008,"sponsor terror, yet their numbers are growing fewer ",UNGD
USA,2008,and they are growing more isolated from the world.  ,UNGD
USA,2008," As the twenty-first century unfolds, some may be ",UNGD
USA,2008,tempted to assume that the threat has receded. That ,UNGD
USA,2008,would be comforting. It would be wrong. The terrorists ,UNGD
USA,2008,"believe time is on their side, so they have made waiting ",UNGD
USA,2008,  ,UNGD
USA,2008, ,UNGD
USA,2008,08-51570 10 ,UNGD
USA,2008, ,UNGD
USA,2008,out civilized nations part of their strategy. We must not ,UNGD
USA,2008,allow them to succeed. The nations of this body must ,UNGD
USA,2008,stand united in the fight against terror. We must ,UNGD
USA,2008,continue working to deny the terrorists refuge ,UNGD
USA,2008,"anywhere in the world, including ungoverned spaces. ",UNGD
USA,2008,We must remain vigilant against proliferation by fully ,UNGD
USA,2008,implementing the terms of resolution 1540 (2004) and ,UNGD
USA,2008,enforcing sanctions against North Korea and Iran. We ,UNGD
USA,2008,must not relent until our people are safe from this ,UNGD
USA,2008,threat to civilization. ,UNGD
USA,2008, To uphold the Charter’s promise of peace and ,UNGD
USA,2008,"security in the twenty-first century, we must also ",UNGD
USA,2008,"confront the ideology of the terrorists. At its core, the ",UNGD
USA,2008,struggle against extremists is a battle of ideas. ,UNGD
USA,2008,Terrorists envision a world in which religious freedom ,UNGD
USA,2008,"is denied, women are oppressed and all dissent is ",UNGD
USA,2008,crushed. The nations represented in this Hall must ,UNGD
USA,2008,present a more hopeful alternative — a vision where ,UNGD
USA,2008,"people can speak freely, worship as they choose and ",UNGD
USA,2008,pursue their dreams in liberty.  ,UNGD
USA,2008, Advancing this vision of freedom serves our ,UNGD
USA,2008,"highest ideals, as expressed in the United Nations ",UNGD
USA,2008,Charter’s commitment to the dignity and worth of the ,UNGD
USA,2008,human person. Advancing this vision also serves our ,UNGD
USA,2008,security interests. History shows that when citizens ,UNGD
USA,2008,"have a voice in choosing their own leaders, they are ",UNGD
USA,2008,"less likely to search for meaning in radical ideologies, ",UNGD
USA,2008,and when Governments respect the rights of their ,UNGD
USA,2008,"people, they are more likely to respect the rights of ",UNGD
USA,2008,their neighbours. ,UNGD
USA,2008," For all these reasons, the nations of this body ",UNGD
USA,2008,must challenge tyranny as vigorously as we challenge ,UNGD
USA,2008,terror. Some question whether people in certain parts of ,UNGD
USA,2008,the world actually desire freedom. This self-serving ,UNGD
USA,2008,condescension has been disproved before our eyes. ,UNGD
USA,2008,"From the voting booths of Afghanistan, Iraq and ",UNGD
USA,2008,"Liberia to the Orange Revolution in Ukraine, the Rose ",UNGD
USA,2008,"Revolution in Georgia, the Cedar Revolution in ",UNGD
USA,2008,"Lebanon and the Tulip Revolution in Kyrgyzstan, we ",UNGD
USA,2008,have seen people consistently make the courageous ,UNGD
USA,2008,decision to demand their liberty. ,UNGD
USA,2008," For all the suggestions to the contrary, the truth is ",UNGD
USA,2008,"that, whenever and wherever people are given the ",UNGD
USA,2008,"choice, they choose freedom. Nations represented in ",UNGD
USA,2008,"this Hall have supported the efforts of dissidents, ",UNGD
USA,2008,reformers and civil society advocates in newly free ,UNGD
USA,2008,societies through the new United Nations Democracy ,UNGD
USA,2008,"Fund, and we appreciate those efforts. As young ",UNGD
USA,2008,democracies around the world continue to make brave ,UNGD
USA,2008,"stands for liberty, multilateral organizations like the ",UNGD
USA,2008,United Nations must continue to stand with them. ,UNGD
USA,2008," In Afghanistan, a determined people are working ",UNGD
USA,2008,to overcome decades of tyranny and protect their newly ,UNGD
USA,2008,free society. They have strong support from all 26 ,UNGD
USA,2008,nations of the NATO alliance. I appreciate the United ,UNGD
USA,2008,Nations decision this week to renew the mandate of the ,UNGD
USA,2008,International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. ,UNGD
USA,2008,The United Nations also has an active civilian presence ,UNGD
USA,2008,"in Afghanistan, where experts are doing important ",UNGD
USA,2008,"work helping to improve education, facilitate ",UNGD
USA,2008,humanitarian aid and protect human rights. We must ,UNGD
USA,2008,continue to help the Afghan people defend their young ,UNGD
USA,2008,democracy so that the Taliban does not return to power ,UNGD
USA,2008,and Afghanistan is never again a safe haven for terror. ,UNGD
USA,2008," In Iraq, the fight has been difficult, yet daily life ",UNGD
USA,2008,has improved dramatically over the past 20 months ,UNGD
USA,2008,"thanks to the courage of the Iraqi people, a determined ",UNGD
USA,2008,coalition of nations and a surge of American troops. ,UNGD
USA,2008,The United Nations has provided the mandate for ,UNGD
USA,2008,"multinational forces in Iraq through this December, and ",UNGD
USA,2008,the United Nations is carrying out an ambitious ,UNGD
USA,2008,"strategy to strengthen Iraq’s democracy, including ",UNGD
USA,2008,helping Iraqis prepare for their next round of free ,UNGD
USA,2008,elections. Whatever disagreements our nations have ,UNGD
USA,2008,"had on Iraq, we should all welcome this progress ",UNGD
USA,2008,towards stability and peace and we should stand united ,UNGD
USA,2008,in helping Iraq’s democracy succeed.  ,UNGD
USA,2008, We must stand united in our support of other ,UNGD
USA,2008,"young democracies, from the people of Lebanon ",UNGD
USA,2008,struggling to maintain their hard-won independence to ,UNGD
USA,2008,"the people of the Palestinian territories, who deserve a ",UNGD
USA,2008,free and peaceful State of their own. We must stand ,UNGD
USA,2008,united in our support of the people of Georgia. The ,UNGD
USA,2008,United Nations Charter sets forth the equal rights of ,UNGD
USA,2008,nations large and small; Russia’s invasion of Georgia ,UNGD
USA,2008,was a violation of those rights. Young democracies ,UNGD
USA,2008,around the world are watching to see how we respond ,UNGD
USA,2008,to this test. The United States has worked with allies in ,UNGD
USA,2008,such multilateral institutions as the European Union ,UNGD
USA,2008,and NATO to uphold Georgia’s territorial integrity and ,UNGD
USA,2008,provide humanitarian relief. Our nations will continue ,UNGD
USA,2008,to support Georgia’s democracy. ,UNGD
USA,2008," In this Hall are representatives of Georgia, ",UNGD
USA,2008,"Ukraine, Lebanon, Afghanistan, Liberia, Iraq and other ",UNGD
USA,2008,"brave young democracies. We admire their courage, we ",UNGD
USA,2008,"honour their sacrifices, and we thank them for their ",UNGD
USA,2008, ,UNGD
USA,2008, ,UNGD
USA,2008,11 08-51570 ,UNGD
USA,2008, ,UNGD
USA,2008,inspiring example. We will continue to stand with all ,UNGD
USA,2008,who stand for freedom. This noble goal is worthy of ,UNGD
USA,2008,the United Nations and it should have the support of ,UNGD
USA,2008,every member of this Assembly.  ,UNGD
USA,2008, Extending the reach of political freedom is ,UNGD
USA,2008,"essential to prevailing in the great struggle of our time, ",UNGD
USA,2008,but it is not enough. Many in this Hall have answered ,UNGD
USA,2008,the call to help their brothers and sisters in need by ,UNGD
USA,2008,working to alleviate hopelessness. Those efforts to ,UNGD
USA,2008,improve the human condition honour the highest ideals ,UNGD
USA,2008,of this institution. They also advance our security ,UNGD
USA,2008,interests. The extremists find their most fertile ,UNGD
USA,2008,recruiting grounds in societies trapped in chaos and ,UNGD
USA,2008,despair — places where people see no prospect of a ,UNGD
USA,2008,"better life. In the shadows of hopelessness, radicalism ",UNGD
USA,2008,"thrives. Eventually, that radicalism can boil over into ",UNGD
USA,2008,"violence, cross borders and take innocent lives across ",UNGD
USA,2008,the world.  ,UNGD
USA,2008, Overcoming hopelessness requires addressing its ,UNGD
USA,2008,"causes: poverty, disease and ignorance. Challenging ",UNGD
USA,2008,these conditions is in the interest of every nation in this ,UNGD
USA,2008,"Hall, and democracies are particularly well positioned ",UNGD
USA,2008,to carry out that work because we have experience ,UNGD
USA,2008,responding to the needs of our own people. We are ,UNGD
USA,2008,natural partners in helping other nations respond to the ,UNGD
USA,2008,"needs of theirs. Together, we must commit our ",UNGD
USA,2008,"resources and efforts to advancing education, health ",UNGD
USA,2008,and prosperity.  ,UNGD
USA,2008," Over the years, many nations have made well-",UNGD
USA,2008,"intentioned efforts to promote these goals, but the ",UNGD
USA,2008,success of these efforts must be measured by more than ,UNGD
USA,2008,intentions. It must be measured by results. My nation is ,UNGD
USA,2008,placing insistence on results at the heart of our foreign ,UNGD
USA,2008,"assistance programmes. We launched a new initiative, ",UNGD
USA,2008,"called the Millennium Challenge Account, which ",UNGD
USA,2008,directs our help to countries that demonstrate their ,UNGD
USA,2008,"ability to produce results by governing justly, fighting ",UNGD
USA,2008,corruption and pursuing market-based economic ,UNGD
USA,2008,"policies, as well as investing in their people. Every ",UNGD
USA,2008,"country and institution that provides foreign assistance, ",UNGD
USA,2008,"including the United Nations, will be more effective by ",UNGD
USA,2008,showing faith in the people of the developing world ,UNGD
USA,2008,and insisting on performance in return for aid.  ,UNGD
USA,2008," Experience also shows that, to be effective, we ",UNGD
USA,2008,"must adopt a model of partnership, not paternalism. ",UNGD
USA,2008,This approach is based on our conviction that people in ,UNGD
USA,2008,the developing world have the capacity to improve ,UNGD
USA,2008,their own lives and will rise to meet high expectations ,UNGD
USA,2008,if we set them. America sought to apply this model in ,UNGD
USA,2008,our Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. Every nation that ,UNGD
USA,2008,receives American support through this initiative ,UNGD
USA,2008,develops its own plan for fighting HIV/AIDS and ,UNGD
USA,2008,measures the results.  ,UNGD
USA,2008," So far, these results are inspiring. Five years ago, ",UNGD
USA,2008,"50,000 people in sub-Saharan Africa were receiving ",UNGD
USA,2008,"treatment for HIV/AIDS; today, that number is nearly ",UNGD
USA,2008,1.7 million. We are taking a similar approach to ,UNGD
USA,2008,"fighting malaria, and so far we have supported local ",UNGD
USA,2008,efforts to protect more than 25 million Africans. ,UNGD
USA,2008,Multilateral organizations have made bold ,UNGD
USA,2008,commitments of their own to fight disease. The G-8 ,UNGD
USA,2008,has pledged to match America’s efforts on malaria and ,UNGD
USA,2008,"HIV/AIDS. Through the Global Fund, many countries ",UNGD
USA,2008,"are working to fight HIV/AIDS, malaria and ",UNGD
USA,2008,tuberculosis. Lives in the developing world depend on ,UNGD
USA,2008,"these programmes, and all who have made pledges to ",UNGD
USA,2008,fight disease have an obligation to follow through on ,UNGD
USA,2008,their commitments.  ,UNGD
USA,2008, One of the most powerful engines of development ,UNGD
USA,2008,"and prosperity are trade and investment, which create ",UNGD
USA,2008,"new opportunities for entrepreneurs, help people rise ",UNGD
USA,2008,out of poverty and reinforce such fundamental values ,UNGD
USA,2008,as transparency and the rule of law. For all these ,UNGD
USA,2008,"reasons, many represented in this Hall have conducted ",UNGD
USA,2008,free-trade agreements at the bilateral and regional ,UNGD
USA,2008,levels.  ,UNGD
USA,2008, The most effective step of all would be an ,UNGD
USA,2008,agreement that tears down trade barriers at the global ,UNGD
USA,2008,level. The recent impasse in the Doha round is ,UNGD
USA,2008,"disappointing, but that does not have to be the final ",UNGD
USA,2008,word. I urge every nation to seize this opportunity to ,UNGD
USA,2008,lift up economies around the world and reach a ,UNGD
USA,2008,successful Doha agreement as soon as possible. ,UNGD
USA,2008,"Beyond Doha, our nations must renew our commitment ",UNGD
USA,2008,to open economies and stand firm against economic ,UNGD
USA,2008,isolationism. These objectives are being tested by ,UNGD
USA,2008,turbulence in the global financial markets.  ,UNGD
USA,2008, Our economies are more closely connected than ,UNGD
USA,2008,"ever before, and I know that many of you here are ",UNGD
USA,2008,watching how the United States Government will ,UNGD
USA,2008,address the problems in our financial system. In recent ,UNGD
USA,2008,weeks we have taken bold steps to prevent a severe ,UNGD
USA,2008,"disruption of the American economy, which would ",UNGD
USA,2008,have a devastating effect on other economies around ,UNGD
USA,2008,the world. We promote stability in the markets by ,UNGD
USA,2008,preventing the disorderly failure of major companies. ,UNGD
USA,2008,  ,UNGD
USA,2008, ,UNGD
USA,2008,08-51570 12 ,UNGD
USA,2008, ,UNGD
USA,2008,The Federal Reserve has injected urgently needed ,UNGD
USA,2008,"liquidity into the system. Last week, I announced ",UNGD
USA,2008,decisive action by the federal Government to address ,UNGD
USA,2008,the root cause of much of the instability in our ,UNGD
USA,2008,financial markets by purchasing illiquid assets that are ,UNGD
USA,2008,weighing down balance sheets and restricting the flow ,UNGD
USA,2008,of credit. I can assure the Assembly that my ,UNGD
USA,2008,Administration and our Congress are working together ,UNGD
USA,2008,to quickly pass legislation approving this strategy. And ,UNGD
USA,2008,I am confident that we will act in the urgent time frame ,UNGD
USA,2008,required.  ,UNGD
USA,2008, The objectives I have laid out for multilateral ,UNGD
USA,2008,"institutions confronting terror, opposing tyranny and ",UNGD
USA,2008,"promoting effective development are difficult, but they ",UNGD
USA,2008,"are necessary tasks. To have maximum impact, ",UNGD
USA,2008,multilateral institutions must take on challenging ,UNGD
USA,2008,"missions, and like all of us in this Hall they must work ",UNGD
USA,2008,"towards measurable goals, be accountable for their ",UNGD
USA,2008,actions and hold true to their word.  ,UNGD
USA,2008," In the twenty-first century, the world needs a ",UNGD
USA,2008,competent and effective United Nations. This unique ,UNGD
USA,2008,institution should build on its successes and improve ,UNGD
USA,2008,its performance. Where there is inefficiency and ,UNGD
USA,2008,"corruption, that must be corrected. Where there are ",UNGD
USA,2008,"bloated bureaucracies, they must be streamlined. ",UNGD
USA,2008,"Where Members fail to uphold their obligations, there ",UNGD
USA,2008,"must be strong action — for example, there should be ",UNGD
USA,2008,"an immediate review of the Human Rights Council, ",UNGD
USA,2008,which has routinely protected violators of human ,UNGD
USA,2008,rights. There should be a stronger effort to help the ,UNGD
USA,2008,people of Burma live free of the repression they have ,UNGD
USA,2008,"suffered for too long. All nations, especially members ",UNGD
USA,2008,"of the Security Council, must act decisively to ensure ",UNGD
USA,2008,that the Government of the Sudan upholds its ,UNGD
USA,2008,commitment to address the violence in Darfur. ,UNGD
USA,2008, The United Nations is an Organization of ,UNGD
USA,2008,"extraordinary potential. As it rebuilds its Headquarters, ",UNGD
USA,2008,it must also open the door to a new age of ,UNGD
USA,2008,"transparency, accountability and seriousness of ",UNGD
USA,2008,"purpose. With determination and clear purpose, the ",UNGD
USA,2008,United Nations can be a powerful force for good as we ,UNGD
USA,2008,head into the twenty-first century. It can affirm the ,UNGD
USA,2008,great promise of its founding.  ,UNGD
USA,2008," In the final days of the San Francisco Conference, ",UNGD
USA,2008,the delegates negotiating the United Nations Charter ,UNGD
USA,2008,received a visit from President Harry Truman. He ,UNGD
USA,2008,acknowledged the enormous challenges they faced and ,UNGD
USA,2008,said that success was possible only because of what he ,UNGD
USA,2008,"called an unshakable unity of determination. Today, the ",UNGD
USA,2008,"world is engaged in another period of great challenge, ",UNGD
USA,2008,"and by continuing to work together, that unshakable ",UNGD
USA,2008,unity of determination will be ours. Together we can ,UNGD
USA,2008,confront and defeat the evil of terrorism. Together we ,UNGD
USA,2008,can secure the Almighty’s gift of liberty and justice to ,UNGD
USA,2008,millions who have not known it. Together we can build ,UNGD
USA,2008,"a world that is freer, safer and better for the ",UNGD
USA,2008,generations who follow. ,UNGD
USA,2009,It is my honour to address the ,UNGD
USA,2009,Assembly for the first time as the forty-fourth ,UNGD
USA,2009,President of the United States. I come before you ,UNGD
USA,2009,humbled by the responsibility that the American people ,UNGD
USA,2009,"have placed upon me, mindful of the enormous ",UNGD
USA,2009,challenges of our moment in history and determined to ,UNGD
USA,2009,act boldly and collectively on behalf of justice and ,UNGD
USA,2009,prosperity at home and abroad. ,UNGD
USA,2009," I have been in office for just nine months, though ",UNGD
USA,2009,some days it seems a lot longer. I am well aware of the ,UNGD
USA,2009,expectations that accompany my presidency around the ,UNGD
USA,2009,world. Those expectations are not about me. Rather ,UNGD
USA,2009,"they are, I believe, rooted in a discontent with the ",UNGD
USA,2009,status quo that has allowed us to be increasingly ,UNGD
USA,2009,defined by our differences and outpaced by our ,UNGD
USA,2009,problems. But they are also rooted in hope — the hope ,UNGD
USA,2009,that real change is possible and the hope that America ,UNGD
USA,2009,will be a leader in bringing about such change. ,UNGD
USA,2009, I took office at a time when many around the ,UNGD
USA,2009,world had come to view America with scepticism and ,UNGD
USA,2009,distrust. A part of that was due to misperceptions and ,UNGD
USA,2009,misinformation about my country. Part was due to ,UNGD
USA,2009,opposition to specific policies and a belief that on ,UNGD
USA,2009,"certain critical issues America had acted unilaterally, ",UNGD
USA,2009,without regard for the interests of others. That has fed ,UNGD
USA,2009,"an almost reflexive anti-Americanism, which too often ",UNGD
USA,2009,has served as an excuse for collective inaction. ,UNGD
USA,2009," Like all of you, my responsibility is to act in the ",UNGD
USA,2009,"interests of my nation and my people, and I will never ",UNGD
USA,2009,apologize for defending those interests. But it is my ,UNGD
USA,2009,"deeply held belief that in the year 2009, more than at ",UNGD
USA,2009,"any point in human history, the interests of nations and ",UNGD
USA,2009,peoples are shared. The religious convictions that we ,UNGD
USA,2009,"hold in our hearts can forge new bonds among people, ",UNGD
USA,2009,or they can tear us apart. The technology we harness ,UNGD
USA,2009,"can light the path to peace, or forever darken it. The ",UNGD
USA,2009,"energy we use can sustain our planet, or destroy it. ",UNGD
USA,2009,"What happens to the hope of a single child, anywhere, ",UNGD
USA,2009,"can enrich our world, or impoverish it. ",UNGD
USA,2009," In this Hall, we come from many places, but we ",UNGD
USA,2009,share a common future. No longer do we have the ,UNGD
USA,2009,luxury of indulging our differences to the exclusion of ,UNGD
USA,2009,the work that we must do together. I have carried this ,UNGD
USA,2009,"message from London to Ankara, from Port-of-Spain to ",UNGD
USA,2009,"Moscow, from Accra to Cairo, and it is what I will ",UNGD
USA,2009,speak about today. ,UNGD
USA,2009, Because the time has come for the world to move ,UNGD
USA,2009,"in a new direction, we must embrace a new era of ",UNGD
USA,2009,engagement based on mutual interests and mutual ,UNGD
USA,2009,"respect, and our work must begin now. We know the ",UNGD
USA,2009,"future will be forged by deeds, and not simply words. ",UNGD
USA,2009,Speeches alone will not solve our problems. It will take ,UNGD
USA,2009,persistent action. ,UNGD
USA,2009, So for those who question the character and cause ,UNGD
USA,2009,"of my nation, I ask you to look at the concrete actions ",UNGD
USA,2009,we have taken in just nine months. ,UNGD
USA,2009," On my first day in office I prohibited, without ",UNGD
USA,2009,"exception or equivocation, the use of torture by the ",UNGD
USA,2009,United States of America. I ordered the prison at ,UNGD
USA,2009,"Guantanamo Bay closed, and we are doing the hard ",UNGD
USA,2009,work of forging a framework to combat extremism ,UNGD
USA,2009,within the rule of law. ,UNGD
USA,2009, Every nation must know that America will live its ,UNGD
USA,2009,"values, and we will lead by example. We have set a ",UNGD
USA,2009,clear and focused goal to work with all members of ,UNGD
USA,2009,"this body to disrupt, dismantle and defeat Al-Qaida and ",UNGD
USA,2009,its extremist allies — a network that has killed ,UNGD
USA,2009,thousands of people of many faiths and nations and has ,UNGD
USA,2009,plotted to blow up this very building. In Afghanistan ,UNGD
USA,2009,"and Pakistan, we and many nations here are helping ",UNGD
USA,2009,those Governments to develop the capacity to take the ,UNGD
USA,2009,"lead in this effort, while working to advance ",UNGD
USA,2009,opportunity and security for their people. ,UNGD
USA,2009, In Iraq we are responsibly ending a war. We have ,UNGD
USA,2009,removed American combat brigades from Iraqi cities ,UNGD
USA,2009,and set a deadline of next August to remove all our ,UNGD
USA,2009,combat brigades from Iraqi territory. I have made clear ,UNGD
USA,2009,that we will help Iraqis make the transition to full ,UNGD
USA,2009,responsibility for their future and keep our ,UNGD
USA,2009,commitment to remove all American troops by the end ,UNGD
USA,2009,of 2011. ,UNGD
USA,2009, I have outlined a comprehensive agenda to seek ,UNGD
USA,2009,the goal of a world without nuclear weapons. In ,UNGD
USA,2009,"Moscow, the United States and Russia announced that ",UNGD
USA,2009,we would pursue substantial reductions in our strategic ,UNGD
USA,2009,warheads and launchers. In the Conference on ,UNGD
USA,2009,Disarmament we agreed on a workplan to negotiate an ,UNGD
USA,2009,end to the production of fissile materials for nuclear ,UNGD
USA,2009,"weapons. And this week, my Secretary of State will ",UNGD
USA,2009,become the first senior American representative to the ,UNGD
USA,2009,  ,UNGD
USA,2009, ,UNGD
USA,2009,09-52179 10 ,UNGD
USA,2009, ,UNGD
USA,2009,annual members’ conference of the Comprehensive ,UNGD
USA,2009,Test Ban Treaty. ,UNGD
USA,2009," Upon taking office, I appointed a special envoy ",UNGD
USA,2009,"for Middle East peace, and America has worked ",UNGD
USA,2009,steadily and aggressively to advance the cause of two ,UNGD
USA,2009,States — Israel and Palestine — in which peace and ,UNGD
USA,2009,security take root and the rights of both Israelis and ,UNGD
USA,2009,Palestinians are respected. ,UNGD
USA,2009, To confront climate change we have invested ,UNGD
USA,2009,$80 billion in clean energy. We have substantially ,UNGD
USA,2009,increased our fuel efficiency standards. We have ,UNGD
USA,2009,"provided new incentives for conservation, launched an ",UNGD
USA,2009,energy partnership across the Americas and moved ,UNGD
USA,2009,from being a bystander to being a leader in ,UNGD
USA,2009,international climate negotiations. ,UNGD
USA,2009, To overcome an economic crisis that touches ,UNGD
USA,2009,"every corner of the world, we worked with the Group ",UNGD
USA,2009,of 20 nations to forge a coordinated international ,UNGD
USA,2009,response of over $2 trillion in stimulus to bring the ,UNGD
USA,2009,global economy back from the brink. We mobilized ,UNGD
USA,2009,resources that help prevent the crisis from spreading ,UNGD
USA,2009,"further to developing countries, and we joined with ",UNGD
USA,2009,others to launch a $20 billion global food security ,UNGD
USA,2009,initiative that will lend a hand to those who need it ,UNGD
USA,2009,most and help them build their own capacity. ,UNGD
USA,2009, We have also re-engaged the United Nations. We ,UNGD
USA,2009,have paid our bills. We have joined the Human Rights ,UNGD
USA,2009,Council. We have signed the Convention on the Rights of ,UNGD
USA,2009,Persons with Disabilities. We have fully embraced the ,UNGD
USA,2009,"Millennium Development Goals, and we address our ",UNGD
USA,2009,"priorities here in this institution, for instance through the ",UNGD
USA,2009,Security Council meeting on nuclear non-proliferation ,UNGD
USA,2009,and disarmament that I will chair tomorrow and ,UNGD
USA,2009,through the issues that I will discuss today. ,UNGD
USA,2009," That is what we have already done, but it is just a ",UNGD
USA,2009,beginning. Some of our actions have yielded progress; ,UNGD
USA,2009,some have laid the groundwork for progress in the ,UNGD
USA,2009,future. But make no mistake: this cannot solely be ,UNGD
USA,2009,America’s endeavour. Those who used to chastise ,UNGD
USA,2009,America for acting alone in the world cannot now ,UNGD
USA,2009,stand by and wait for America to solve the world’s ,UNGD
USA,2009,"problems alone. We have sought, in word and deed, a ",UNGD
USA,2009,"new era of engagement with the world, and now is the ",UNGD
USA,2009,time for all of us to take our share of responsibility for ,UNGD
USA,2009,a global response to global challenges. ,UNGD
USA,2009," If we are honest with ourselves, we need to admit ",UNGD
USA,2009,that we are not living up to that responsibility. ,UNGD
USA,2009,Consider the course that we are on if we fail to ,UNGD
USA,2009,confront the status quo: extremists sowing terror in ,UNGD
USA,2009,"pockets of the world, protracted conflicts that grind on ",UNGD
USA,2009,"and on, genocide, mass atrocities, more nations with ",UNGD
USA,2009,"nuclear weapons, melting ice caps and ravaged ",UNGD
USA,2009,"populations, persistent poverty and pandemic disease. ",UNGD
USA,2009," I say this not to sow fear, but to state a fact. The ",UNGD
USA,2009,magnitude of our challenges has yet to be met by the ,UNGD
USA,2009,measure of our actions. This body was founded on the ,UNGD
USA,2009,belief that the nations of the world could solve their ,UNGD
USA,2009,"problems together. Franklin Roosevelt, who died ",UNGD
USA,2009,before he could see his vision for this institution ,UNGD
USA,2009,"become a reality, put it this way: ",UNGD
USA,2009, “The structure of world peace cannot be the work ,UNGD
USA,2009,"of one man, or one party, or one nation. It cannot ",UNGD
USA,2009,be a peace of large nations or of small nations. It ,UNGD
USA,2009,must be a peace which rests on the cooperative ,UNGD
USA,2009,effort of the whole world.” ,UNGD
USA,2009, The cooperative effort of the whole world — ,UNGD
USA,2009,those words ring even more true today when it is not ,UNGD
USA,2009,"simply peace, but our very health and prosperity that ",UNGD
USA,2009,"we hold in common. Yet, we also know that this body ",UNGD
USA,2009,"is made up of sovereign States and that, sadly but not ",UNGD
USA,2009,"surprisingly, this body has often become a forum for ",UNGD
USA,2009,"sowing discord instead of forging common ground, a ",UNGD
USA,2009,venue for playing politics and exploiting grievances ,UNGD
USA,2009,"rather than solving problems. After all, it is easy to ",UNGD
USA,2009,walk up to this podium and point fingers and stoke ,UNGD
USA,2009,divisions. Nothing is easier than blaming others for our ,UNGD
USA,2009,troubles and absolving ourselves of responsibility for ,UNGD
USA,2009,our choices and our actions. Anybody can do that. ,UNGD
USA,2009,Responsibility and leadership in the twenty-first ,UNGD
USA,2009,century demand more. ,UNGD
USA,2009," In an era when our destiny is shared, power is no ",UNGD
USA,2009,longer a zero-sum game. No one nation can or should ,UNGD
USA,2009,try to dominate another nation. No world order that ,UNGD
USA,2009,elevates one nation or group of people over another ,UNGD
USA,2009,will succeed. No balance of power among nations will ,UNGD
USA,2009,hold. The traditional divisions between nations of the ,UNGD
USA,2009,South and the North make no sense in an ,UNGD
USA,2009,"interconnected world, nor do alignments of nations ",UNGD
USA,2009,rooted in the cleavages of a long-gone cold war. ,UNGD
USA,2009, The time has come to realize that the old habits ,UNGD
USA,2009,and the old arguments are irrelevant to the challenges ,UNGD
USA,2009,faced by our peoples. They leave nations to act in ,UNGD
USA,2009,opposition to the very goals that they claim to pursue ,UNGD
USA,2009,"and to vote, often in this body, against the interests of ",UNGD
USA,2009,their own people. They build up walls between us and ,UNGD
USA,2009, ,UNGD
USA,2009, ,UNGD
USA,2009,11 09-52179 ,UNGD
USA,2009, ,UNGD
USA,2009,"the future that our peoples seek, and the time has come ",UNGD
USA,2009,for those walls to come down. Together we must build ,UNGD
USA,2009,new coalitions that bridge old divides — coalitions of ,UNGD
USA,2009,"different faiths and creeds, of North and South, East, ",UNGD
USA,2009,"West, black, white and brown. ",UNGD
USA,2009, The choice is ours. We can be remembered as the ,UNGD
USA,2009,generation that chose to drag the arguments of the ,UNGD
USA,2009,"twentieth century into the twenty-first, and that put off ",UNGD
USA,2009,"hard choices, refused to look ahead, and failed to keep ",UNGD
USA,2009,pace because we defined ourselves by what we were ,UNGD
USA,2009,against instead of what we were for; or we can be a ,UNGD
USA,2009,generation that chooses to see the shoreline beyond the ,UNGD
USA,2009,"rough waters ahead, that comes together to serve the ",UNGD
USA,2009,"common interests of human beings, and finally gives ",UNGD
USA,2009,meaning to the promise imbedded in the name given to ,UNGD
USA,2009,this institution — the United Nations. That is the future ,UNGD
USA,2009,America wants — a future of peace and prosperity that ,UNGD
USA,2009,we can reach only if we recognize that all nations have ,UNGD
USA,2009,rights. But all nations have responsibilities as well. ,UNGD
USA,2009,That is the bargain that makes this work. That must be ,UNGD
USA,2009,the guiding principle of international cooperation. ,UNGD
USA,2009," Today, let me put forward four pillars that I ",UNGD
USA,2009,believe are fundamental to the future that we want for ,UNGD
USA,2009,"our children: non-proliferation and disarmament, the ",UNGD
USA,2009,"promotion of peace and security, the preservation of ",UNGD
USA,2009,"our planet, and a global economy that advances ",UNGD
USA,2009,opportunity for all people. ,UNGD
USA,2009," First, we must stop the spread of nuclear weapons ",UNGD
USA,2009,and seek the goal of a world without them. This ,UNGD
USA,2009,institution was founded at the dawn of the atomic age ,UNGD
USA,2009,in part because man’s capacity to kill had to be ,UNGD
USA,2009,"contained. For decades, we averted disaster, even under ",UNGD
USA,2009,the shadow of a super-Power stand-off. But today the ,UNGD
USA,2009,threat of proliferation is growing in scope and ,UNGD
USA,2009,"complexity. If we fail to act, we will invite nuclear ",UNGD
USA,2009,arms races in every region and the prospect of wars and ,UNGD
USA,2009,acts of terror on a scale that we can hardly imagine. ,UNGD
USA,2009, A fragile consensus stands in the way of this ,UNGD
USA,2009,"frightening outcome, and that is the basic bargain that ",UNGD
USA,2009,shapes the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear ,UNGD
USA,2009,Weapons (NPT). It says that all nations have the right ,UNGD
USA,2009,"to peaceful nuclear energy, and that nations with ",UNGD
USA,2009,nuclear weapons have a responsibility to move towards ,UNGD
USA,2009,disarmament and those without them have the ,UNGD
USA,2009,responsibility to forsake them. The next 12 months ,UNGD
USA,2009,could be pivotal in determining whether this compact ,UNGD
USA,2009,will be strengthened or will slowly dissolve. ,UNGD
USA,2009, America intends to keep our end of the bargain. ,UNGD
USA,2009,We will pursue a new agreement with Russia to ,UNGD
USA,2009,substantially reduce our strategic warheads and ,UNGD
USA,2009,launches. We will move forward with ratification of the ,UNGD
USA,2009,Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and work ,UNGD
USA,2009,"with others to bring the Treaty into force, so that ",UNGD
USA,2009,nuclear testing is permanently prohibited. We will ,UNGD
USA,2009,complete a nuclear posture review that opens the door ,UNGD
USA,2009,"to deeper cuts and reduces the role of nuclear weapons, ",UNGD
USA,2009,and we will call upon countries to begin negotiations in ,UNGD
USA,2009,January on a treaty to end the production of fissile ,UNGD
USA,2009,material for weapons. ,UNGD
USA,2009, I will also host a summit next April that reaffirms ,UNGD
USA,2009,each nation’s responsibility to secure nuclear material ,UNGD
USA,2009,"on its territory and to help those who cannot, because ",UNGD
USA,2009,we must never allow a single nuclear device to fall into ,UNGD
USA,2009,the hands of a violent extremist. And we will work to ,UNGD
USA,2009,strengthen the institutions and initiatives that combat ,UNGD
USA,2009,nuclear smuggling and theft. ,UNGD
USA,2009, All of this must support efforts to strengthen the ,UNGD
USA,2009,NPT. Those nations that refuse to live up to their ,UNGD
USA,2009,obligations must face consequences. Let me be clear: ,UNGD
USA,2009,This is not about singling out individual nations. It is ,UNGD
USA,2009,about standing up for the rights of all nations that do ,UNGD
USA,2009,"live up to their responsibilities, because a world in ",UNGD
USA,2009,which International Atomic Energy Agency inspections ,UNGD
USA,2009,are avoided and the United Nations demands are ,UNGD
USA,2009,ignored will leave all people less safe and all nations ,UNGD
USA,2009,less secure. ,UNGD
USA,2009," In their actions to date, the Governments of North ",UNGD
USA,2009,Korea and Iran threaten to take us down this dangerous ,UNGD
USA,2009,slope. We respect their rights as members of the ,UNGD
USA,2009,community of nations. I have said before and I will ,UNGD
USA,2009,repeat: I am committed to diplomacy that opens a path ,UNGD
USA,2009,to greater prosperity and more secure peace for both ,UNGD
USA,2009,nations if they live up to their obligations. But if the ,UNGD
USA,2009,Governments of Iran and North Korea choose to ignore ,UNGD
USA,2009,international standards; if they put the pursuit of ,UNGD
USA,2009,nuclear weapons ahead of regional stability and the ,UNGD
USA,2009,security and opportunity of their own people; if they ,UNGD
USA,2009,are oblivious to the dangers of escalating nuclear arms ,UNGD
USA,2009,"races in both East Asia and the Middle East, then they ",UNGD
USA,2009,must be held accountable. The world must stand ,UNGD
USA,2009,together to demonstrate that international law is not an ,UNGD
USA,2009,empty promise and that treaties will be enforced. We ,UNGD
USA,2009,must insist that the future does not belong to fear. ,UNGD
USA,2009, That brings me to the second pillar for our future: ,UNGD
USA,2009,the pursuit of peace. The United Nations was born of ,UNGD
USA,2009,  ,UNGD
USA,2009, ,UNGD
USA,2009,09-52179 12 ,UNGD
USA,2009, ,UNGD
USA,2009,the belief that the people of the world can live their ,UNGD
USA,2009,"lives, raise their families and resolve their differences ",UNGD
USA,2009,peacefully. Yet we know that in too many parts of the ,UNGD
USA,2009,world this ideal remains an abstraction — a distant ,UNGD
USA,2009,dream. We can either accept that outcome as inevitable ,UNGD
USA,2009,"and tolerate constant and crippling conflict, or we can ",UNGD
USA,2009,recognize that the yearning for peace is universal and ,UNGD
USA,2009,reassert our resolve to end conflicts around the world. ,UNGD
USA,2009,That effort must begin with an unshakeable ,UNGD
USA,2009,"determination that the murder of innocent men, women ",UNGD
USA,2009,"and children will never be tolerated. On this, there can ",UNGD
USA,2009,be no dispute. ,UNGD
USA,2009, The violent extremists who promote conflict by ,UNGD
USA,2009,distorting faith have discredited and isolated ,UNGD
USA,2009,themselves. They offer nothing but hatred and ,UNGD
USA,2009,"destruction. In confronting them, America will forge ",UNGD
USA,2009,"lasting partnerships to target terrorists, share ",UNGD
USA,2009,"intelligence, coordinate law enforcement and protect ",UNGD
USA,2009,our people. We will permit no safe haven for Al-Qaida ,UNGD
USA,2009,to launch attacks from Afghanistan or any other nation. ,UNGD
USA,2009,"We will stand by our friends on the front lines, as we ",UNGD
USA,2009,and many nations will do in pledging support for the ,UNGD
USA,2009,Pakistani people tomorrow. And we will pursue ,UNGD
USA,2009,positive engagement that builds bridges among faiths ,UNGD
USA,2009,and new partnerships for opportunity. ,UNGD
USA,2009," Our efforts to promote peace, however, cannot be ",UNGD
USA,2009,"limited to defeating violent extremists, for the most ",UNGD
USA,2009,powerful weapon in our arsenal is the hope of human ,UNGD
USA,2009,beings — the belief that the future belongs to those ,UNGD
USA,2009,who would build and not destroy; the confidence that ,UNGD
USA,2009,conflicts can end and a new day can begin. And that is ,UNGD
USA,2009,why we will strengthen our support for effective ,UNGD
USA,2009,"peacekeeping, while energizing our efforts to prevent ",UNGD
USA,2009,conflicts before they take hold.  ,UNGD
USA,2009," We will pursue a lasting peace in Sudan, through ",UNGD
USA,2009,support for the people of Darfur and the implementation ,UNGD
USA,2009,"of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, so that we ",UNGD
USA,2009,secure the peace that the Sudanese people deserve. ,UNGD
USA,2009," And in countries ravaged by violence, from Haiti to ",UNGD
USA,2009,"Congo to East Timor, we will work with the United ",UNGD
USA,2009,Nations and other partners to support an enduring peace. ,UNGD
USA,2009, I will also continue to seek a just and lasting ,UNGD
USA,2009,"peace between Israel, Palestine and the Arab world. We ",UNGD
USA,2009,will continue to work on that issue. Yesterday I had a ,UNGD
USA,2009,constructive meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu ,UNGD
USA,2009,and President Abbas. We have made some progress. ,UNGD
USA,2009,Palestinians have strengthened their efforts on security. ,UNGD
USA,2009,Israelis have facilitated greater freedom of movement ,UNGD
USA,2009,for the Palestinians. As a result of these efforts on both ,UNGD
USA,2009,"sides, the economy in the West Bank has begun to ",UNGD
USA,2009,grow. ,UNGD
USA,2009, But more progress is needed. We continue to call ,UNGD
USA,2009,on Palestinians to end incitement against Israel. And ,UNGD
USA,2009,we continue to emphasize that America does not accept ,UNGD
USA,2009,the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements. ,UNGD
USA,2009, The time has come to re-launch negotiations — ,UNGD
USA,2009,without preconditions — that address the permanent-,UNGD
USA,2009,"status issues: security for Israelis and Palestinians, ",UNGD
USA,2009,"borders, refugees and Jerusalem. The goal is clear: two ",UNGD
USA,2009,States living side by side in peace and security: a ,UNGD
USA,2009,"Jewish State of Israel, with true security for all Israelis, ",UNGD
USA,2009,"and a viable, independent Palestinian State with ",UNGD
USA,2009,contiguous territory that ends the occupation that began ,UNGD
USA,2009,in 1967 and realizes the potential of the Palestinian ,UNGD
USA,2009,"people. As we pursue this goal, we will also pursue ",UNGD
USA,2009,"peace between Israel and Lebanon, Israel and Syria, ",UNGD
USA,2009,and a broader peace between Israel and its many ,UNGD
USA,2009,"neighbours. In pursuit of that goal, we will develop ",UNGD
USA,2009,"regional initiatives with multilateral participation, ",UNGD
USA,2009,alongside bilateral negotiations. ,UNGD
USA,2009," Now, I am not naive. I know this will be difficult. ",UNGD
USA,2009,But all of us — not just the Israelis and the ,UNGD
USA,2009,"Palestinians, but all of us — must decide whether we ",UNGD
USA,2009,"are serious about peace, or whether we will only lend it ",UNGD
USA,2009,lip-service. To break the old patterns — to break the ,UNGD
USA,2009,cycle of insecurity and despair — all of us must say ,UNGD
USA,2009,publicly what we would acknowledge in private. The ,UNGD
USA,2009,United States does Israel no favours when we fail to ,UNGD
USA,2009,couple an unwavering commitment to its security with ,UNGD
USA,2009,an insistence that Israel respect the legitimate claims ,UNGD
USA,2009,and rights of the Palestinians. And nations within this ,UNGD
USA,2009,body do the Palestinians no favours when they choose ,UNGD
USA,2009,vitriolic attacks against Israel over a constructive ,UNGD
USA,2009,willingness to recognize Israel’s legitimacy and its ,UNGD
USA,2009,right to exist in peace and security. ,UNGD
USA,2009, We must remember that the greatest price of this ,UNGD
USA,2009,conflict is not paid by us. It is not paid by politicians. ,UNGD
USA,2009,It is paid by the Israeli girl in Sderot who closes her ,UNGD
USA,2009,eyes in fear that a rocket will take her life in the middle ,UNGD
USA,2009,of the night. It is paid by the Palestinian boy in Gaza ,UNGD
USA,2009,who has no clean water and no country to call his own. ,UNGD
USA,2009,These are all God’s children. And after all the politics ,UNGD
USA,2009,"and all the posturing, this is about the right of every ",UNGD
USA,2009,human being to live with dignity and security. That is a ,UNGD
USA,2009,lesson embedded in the three great faiths that call one ,UNGD
USA,2009,small slice of Earth the Holy Land. And that is why — ,UNGD
USA,2009, ,UNGD
USA,2009, ,UNGD
USA,2009,13 09-52179 ,UNGD
USA,2009, ,UNGD
USA,2009,"even though there will be setbacks, and false starts, and ",UNGD
USA,2009,tough days — I will not waiver in my pursuit of peace. ,UNGD
USA,2009," Thirdly, we must recognize that in the twenty-",UNGD
USA,2009,first century there will be no peace unless we take ,UNGD
USA,2009,responsibility for the preservation of our planet. And I ,UNGD
USA,2009,thank the Secretary-General for hosting the summit on ,UNGD
USA,2009,climate change yesterday. ,UNGD
USA,2009, The danger posed by climate change cannot be ,UNGD
USA,2009,denied. Our responsibility to meet it must not be ,UNGD
USA,2009,"deferred. If we continue down our current course, ",UNGD
USA,2009,every member of this Assembly will see irreversible ,UNGD
USA,2009,changes within its borders. Our efforts to end conflicts ,UNGD
USA,2009,will be eclipsed by wars over refugees and resources. ,UNGD
USA,2009,Development will be devastated by drought and ,UNGD
USA,2009,famine. Land that human beings have lived on for ,UNGD
USA,2009,millennia will disappear. Future generations will look ,UNGD
USA,2009,back and wonder why we refused to act — why we ,UNGD
USA,2009,failed to pass on an environment that was worthy of ,UNGD
USA,2009,our inheritance. ,UNGD
USA,2009, And that is why the days when America dragged ,UNGD
USA,2009,its feet on this issue are over. We will move forward ,UNGD
USA,2009,"with investments to transform our energy economy, ",UNGD
USA,2009,while providing incentives to make clean energy the ,UNGD
USA,2009,profitable kind of energy. We will press ahead with ,UNGD
USA,2009,deep cuts in emissions to reach the goals that we set for ,UNGD
USA,2009,"2020, and eventually 2050. We will continue to ",UNGD
USA,2009,promote renewable energy and efficiency — and share ,UNGD
USA,2009,new technologies — with countries around the world. ,UNGD
USA,2009,And we will seize every opportunity for progress to ,UNGD
USA,2009,address this threat in a cooperative effort with the ,UNGD
USA,2009,entire world. ,UNGD
USA,2009, Those wealthy nations that did so much damage ,UNGD
USA,2009,to the environment in the twentieth century must ,UNGD
USA,2009,accept our obligation to lead. But responsibility does ,UNGD
USA,2009,not end there. While we must acknowledge the need for ,UNGD
USA,2009,"differentiated responses, any effort to curb carbon ",UNGD
USA,2009,emissions must include the fast-growing carbon ,UNGD
USA,2009,emitters who can do more to reduce their air pollution ,UNGD
USA,2009,without inhibiting growth. And any effort that fails ,UNGD
USA,2009,both to help the poorest nations to adapt to the ,UNGD
USA,2009,problems that climate change has already wrought and ,UNGD
USA,2009,to help them travel a path of clean development simply ,UNGD
USA,2009,will not work. ,UNGD
USA,2009, It is hard to change something as fundamental as ,UNGD
USA,2009,how we use energy. I know that. It is even harder to do ,UNGD
USA,2009,"so in the midst of a global recession. Certainly, it will ",UNGD
USA,2009,be tempting to sit back and wait for others to move ,UNGD
USA,2009,first. But we cannot make this journey unless we all ,UNGD
USA,2009,"move forward together. As we head into Copenhagen, ",UNGD
USA,2009,let us resolve to focus on what each of us can do for ,UNGD
USA,2009,the sake of our common future. ,UNGD
USA,2009, This leads me to the final pillar that must fortify ,UNGD
USA,2009,our future: a global economy that advances opportunity ,UNGD
USA,2009,for all people. ,UNGD
USA,2009, The world is still recovering from the worst ,UNGD
USA,2009,economic crisis since the Great Depression. In ,UNGD
USA,2009,"America, we see the engine of growth beginning to ",UNGD
USA,2009,"churn, and yet many still struggle to find a job or pay ",UNGD
USA,2009,"their bills. Across the globe, we find promising signs, ",UNGD
USA,2009,but little certainty about what lies ahead. And far too ,UNGD
USA,2009,many people in far too many places live through the ,UNGD
USA,2009,daily crises that challenge our humanity: the despair of ,UNGD
USA,2009,an empty stomach; the thirst brought on by dwindling ,UNGD
USA,2009,water supplies; the injustice of a child dying from a ,UNGD
USA,2009,treatable disease or a mother losing her life as she ,UNGD
USA,2009,gives birth. ,UNGD
USA,2009," In Pittsburgh, we will work with the world’s ",UNGD
USA,2009,largest economies to chart a course for growth that is ,UNGD
USA,2009,balanced and sustained. That means vigilance to ensure ,UNGD
USA,2009,that we do not let up until our people are back to work. ,UNGD
USA,2009,"That means taking steps to rekindle demand, so that ",UNGD
USA,2009,global recovery can be sustained. And that means ,UNGD
USA,2009,setting new rules of the road and strengthening ,UNGD
USA,2009,"regulation for all financial centres, so that we put an ",UNGD
USA,2009,end to the greed and the excess and the abuse that led ,UNGD
USA,2009,"us into this disaster, and prevent a crisis like this from ",UNGD
USA,2009,ever happening again. ,UNGD
USA,2009," At a time of such interdependence, we have a ",UNGD
USA,2009,"moral and pragmatic interest, however, in broader ",UNGD
USA,2009,questions of development: the questions of development ,UNGD
USA,2009,that existed even before this crisis happened. And so ,UNGD
USA,2009,America will continue our historic effort to help people ,UNGD
USA,2009,feed themselves. We have set aside $63 billion to carry ,UNGD
USA,2009,"forward the fight against HIV/AIDS, to end deaths ",UNGD
USA,2009,"from tuberculosis and malaria, to eradicate polio and to ",UNGD
USA,2009,strengthen public health systems. We are joining with ,UNGD
USA,2009,other countries to contribute H1N1 vaccines to the ,UNGD
USA,2009,World Health Organization. We will integrate more ,UNGD
USA,2009,economies into a system of global trade. We will ,UNGD
USA,2009,support the Millennium Development Goals and ,UNGD
USA,2009,approach next year’s summit with a global plan to ,UNGD
USA,2009,make them a reality. And we will set our sights on the ,UNGD
USA,2009,eradication of extreme poverty in our time. ,UNGD
USA,2009, Now is the time for all of us to do our part. ,UNGD
USA,2009,Growth will not be sustained or shared unless all ,UNGD
USA,2009,nations embrace their responsibilities. That means that ,UNGD
USA,2009,  ,UNGD
USA,2009, ,UNGD
USA,2009,09-52179 14 ,UNGD
USA,2009, ,UNGD
USA,2009,wealthy nations must open their markets to more goods ,UNGD
USA,2009,"and extend a hand to those with less, while reforming ",UNGD
USA,2009,international institutions to give more nations a greater ,UNGD
USA,2009,voice. And developing nations must root out the ,UNGD
USA,2009,"corruption that is an obstacle to progress, for ",UNGD
USA,2009,opportunity cannot thrive where individuals are ,UNGD
USA,2009,oppressed and businesses have to pay bribes. That is ,UNGD
USA,2009,why we will support honest police and independent ,UNGD
USA,2009,"judges, civil society and a vibrant private sector. Our ",UNGD
USA,2009,goal is simple: a global economy in which growth is ,UNGD
USA,2009,sustained and opportunity is available to all. ,UNGD
USA,2009," Now, the changes that I have spoken about today ",UNGD
USA,2009,"will not be easy to make, and they will not be realized ",UNGD
USA,2009,simply by leaders like us coming together in forums ,UNGD
USA,2009,"like this, as useful as that may be. For, as in any ",UNGD
USA,2009,"assembly of members, real change can only come ",UNGD
USA,2009,through the people we represent. That is why we must ,UNGD
USA,2009,do the hard work to lay the groundwork for progress in ,UNGD
USA,2009,our own capitals. That is where we will build the ,UNGD
USA,2009,consensus to end conflicts and to harness technology ,UNGD
USA,2009,"for peaceful purposes, to change the way we use ",UNGD
USA,2009,energy and to promote growth that can be sustained ,UNGD
USA,2009,and shared. ,UNGD
USA,2009, I believe that the people of the world want this ,UNGD
USA,2009,future for their children. And that is why we must ,UNGD
USA,2009,champion those principles that ensure that ,UNGD
USA,2009,Governments reflect the will of the people. These ,UNGD
USA,2009,principles cannot be afterthoughts. Democracy and ,UNGD
USA,2009,human rights are essential to achieving each of the ,UNGD
USA,2009,"goals that I have discussed today, because ",UNGD
USA,2009,Governments of the people and by the people are more ,UNGD
USA,2009,likely to act in the broader interests of their own ,UNGD
USA,2009,"people, rather than the narrow interest of those in ",UNGD
USA,2009,power. ,UNGD
USA,2009, The test of our leadership will not be the degree ,UNGD
USA,2009,to which we feed the fears and old hatreds of our ,UNGD
USA,2009,people. True leadership will not be measured by the ,UNGD
USA,2009,ability to muzzle dissent or to intimidate and harass ,UNGD
USA,2009,political opponents at home. The people of the world ,UNGD
USA,2009,want change. They will not long tolerate those who are ,UNGD
USA,2009,on the wrong side of history. ,UNGD
USA,2009, This Organization’s Charter commits each of us ,UNGD
USA,2009,"“to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the ",UNGD
USA,2009,"dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal ",UNGD
USA,2009,rights of men and women”. ,UNGD
USA,2009, Among those rights is the freedom to speak your ,UNGD
USA,2009,"mind and worship as you please, the promise of ",UNGD
USA,2009,equality of the races and the opportunity for women ,UNGD
USA,2009,"and girls to pursue their own potential, and the ability ",UNGD
USA,2009,of citizens to have a say in how you are governed and ,UNGD
USA,2009,"to have confidence in the administration of justice. For, ",UNGD
USA,2009,just as no nation should be forced to accept the tyranny ,UNGD
USA,2009,"of another nation, no individual should be forced to ",UNGD
USA,2009,accept the tyranny of their own people. ,UNGD
USA,2009," As an African-American, I will never forget that I ",UNGD
USA,2009,would not be here today without the steady pursuit of a ,UNGD
USA,2009,more perfect union in my country. That guides my ,UNGD
USA,2009,"belief that no matter how dark the day may seem, ",UNGD
USA,2009,transformative change can be forged by those who ,UNGD
USA,2009,choose to side with justice. And I pledge that America ,UNGD
USA,2009,will always stand with those who stand up for their ,UNGD
USA,2009,dignity and their rights — for the student who seeks to ,UNGD
USA,2009,"learn, the voter who demands to be heard, the innocent ",UNGD
USA,2009,who longs to be free and the oppressed who yearns to ,UNGD
USA,2009,be equal. ,UNGD
USA,2009, Democracy cannot be imposed on any nation ,UNGD
USA,2009,from the outside. Each society must search for its own ,UNGD
USA,2009,"path, and no path is perfect. Each country will pursue a ",UNGD
USA,2009,path rooted in the culture of its people and in its past ,UNGD
USA,2009,traditions. And I admit that America has too often been ,UNGD
USA,2009,selective in its promotion of democracy. But that does ,UNGD
USA,2009,not weaken our commitment; it only reinforces it. ,UNGD
USA,2009,There are basic principles that are universal. There are ,UNGD
USA,2009,"certain truths that are self-evident, and the United ",UNGD
USA,2009,States of America will never waiver in our efforts to ,UNGD
USA,2009,stand up for the right of people everywhere to ,UNGD
USA,2009,determine their own destiny. ,UNGD
USA,2009," Sixty-five years ago, a weary Franklin Roosevelt ",UNGD
USA,2009,"spoke to the American people in his fourth, and final, ",UNGD
USA,2009,"inaugural address. After years of war, he sought to sum ",UNGD
USA,2009,up the lessons that could be drawn from the terrible ,UNGD
USA,2009,suffering and enormous sacrifice that had taken place. ,UNGD
USA,2009,"We have learned, he said, to be citizens of the world, ",UNGD
USA,2009,members of the human community. The United Nations ,UNGD
USA,2009,was built by men and women like Roosevelt from ,UNGD
USA,2009,"every corner of the world — from Africa and Asia, ",UNGD
USA,2009,from Europe to the Americas. These architects of ,UNGD
USA,2009,international cooperation had an idealism that was ,UNGD
USA,2009,anything but naive. It was rooted in the hard-earned ,UNGD
USA,2009,"lessons of war, rooted in the wisdom that nations could ",UNGD
USA,2009,advance their interests by acting together instead of ,UNGD
USA,2009,splitting apart. ,UNGD
USA,2009," Now it falls to us, for this institution will be what ",UNGD
USA,2009,we make of it. The United Nations does extraordinary ,UNGD
USA,2009,"good around the world, in feeding the hungry, caring ",UNGD
USA,2009,for the sick and mending places that have been broken. ,UNGD
USA,2009, ,UNGD
USA,2009, ,UNGD
USA,2009,15 09-52179 ,UNGD
USA,2009, ,UNGD
USA,2009,But it also struggles to enforce its will and to live up to ,UNGD
USA,2009,the ideals of its founding. I believe that those ,UNGD
USA,2009,imperfections are not a reason to walk away from this ,UNGD
USA,2009,institution; they are a calling to redouble our efforts. ,UNGD
USA,2009,The United Nations can be a place where we either ,UNGD
USA,2009,bicker about outdated grievances or forge common ,UNGD
USA,2009,ground; a place where we focus on what drives us apart ,UNGD
USA,2009,or what brings us together; a place where we indulge ,UNGD
USA,2009,"tyranny or a source of moral authority. In short, the ",UNGD
USA,2009,United Nations can be an institution that is ,UNGD
USA,2009,disconnected from what matters in the lives of our ,UNGD
USA,2009,citizens or it can be an indispensable factor in ,UNGD
USA,2009,advancing the interests of the people we serve. ,UNGD
USA,2009, We have reached a pivotal moment. The United ,UNGD
USA,2009,States stands ready to begin a new chapter of ,UNGD
USA,2009,"international cooperation, one that recognizes the ",UNGD
USA,2009,"rights and responsibilities of all nations. And so, with ",UNGD
USA,2009,confidence in our cause and with a commitment to our ,UNGD
USA,2009,"values, we call on all nations to join us in building the ",UNGD
USA,2009,future that our people so richly deserve.,UNGD
USA,2010,It is a great honour to address ,UNGD
USA,2010,"this Assembly for the second time, nearly two years ",UNGD
USA,2010,after my election as President of the United States. We ,UNGD
USA,2010,know this is no ordinary time for our people. We each ,UNGD
USA,2010,come here with our own problems and priorities. But ,UNGD
USA,2010,there are also challenges that we share in common as ,UNGD
USA,2010,leaders and as nations. ,UNGD
USA,2010, We meet within an institution built from the ,UNGD
USA,2010,"rubble of war, designed to unite the world in pursuit of ",UNGD
USA,2010,peace. And we meet within a city that for centuries has ,UNGD
USA,2010,"welcomed people from across the globe, demonstrating ",UNGD
USA,2010,"that individuals of every colour, faith and station can ",UNGD
USA,2010,"come together to pursue opportunity, build a ",UNGD
USA,2010,community and live with the blessing of human liberty. ,UNGD
USA,2010," Outside the doors of this Hall, the blocks and ",UNGD
USA,2010,neighbourhoods of this great city tell the story of a ,UNGD
USA,2010,"difficult decade. Nine years ago, the destruction of the ",UNGD
USA,2010,World Trade Center signalled a threat that respected no ,UNGD
USA,2010,boundary of dignity or decency. Two years ago this ,UNGD
USA,2010,"month, a financial crisis on Wall Street devastated ",UNGD
USA,2010,American families on Main Street. These separate ,UNGD
USA,2010,challenges have affected people around the world. Men ,UNGD
USA,2010,and women and children have been murdered by ,UNGD
USA,2010,"extremists from Casablanca to London, from Jalalabad ",UNGD
USA,2010,to Jakarta. The global economy suffered an enormous ,UNGD
USA,2010,"blow during the financial crisis, crippling markets and ",UNGD
USA,2010,deferring the dreams of millions on every continent. ,UNGD
USA,2010,Underneath these challenges to our security and ,UNGD
USA,2010,prosperity lie deeper fears: that ancient hatreds and ,UNGD
USA,2010,religious divides are once again ascendant; that a world ,UNGD
USA,2010,which has grown more interconnected has somehow ,UNGD
USA,2010,slipped beyond our control. ,UNGD
USA,2010, These are some of the challenges that my ,UNGD
USA,2010,Administration has confronted since we came into ,UNGD
USA,2010,"office. And today, I would like to talk to the Assembly ",UNGD
USA,2010,about what we have done over the last 20 months to ,UNGD
USA,2010,meet these challenges; what our responsibility is to ,UNGD
USA,2010,pursue peace in the Middle East; and what kind of ,UNGD
USA,2010,world we are trying to build in this twenty-first ,UNGD
USA,2010,century. ,UNGD
USA,2010, Let me begin with what we have done. I have had ,UNGD
USA,2010,no greater focus as President than rescuing our ,UNGD
USA,2010,economy from potential catastrophe. And in an age ,UNGD
USA,2010,"when prosperity is shared, we could not do this alone. ",UNGD
USA,2010,So America has joined with nations around the world ,UNGD
USA,2010,to spur growth and the renewed demand that could ,UNGD
USA,2010,restart job creation. ,UNGD
USA,2010," We are reforming our system of global finance, ",UNGD
USA,2010,"beginning with Wall Street reform here at home, so that ",UNGD
USA,2010,a crisis like this never happens again. And we made the ,UNGD
USA,2010,Group of 20 the focal point for international ,UNGD
USA,2010,"coordination, because in a world where prosperity is ",UNGD
USA,2010,"more diffuse, we must broaden our circle of ",UNGD
USA,2010,cooperation to include emerging economies —,UNGD
USA,2010,economies from every corner of the globe. ,UNGD
USA,2010," There is much to show for our efforts, even as ",UNGD
USA,2010,there is much work to be done. The global economy ,UNGD
USA,2010,has been pulled back from the brink of a depression ,UNGD
USA,2010,and is growing once more. We have resisted ,UNGD
USA,2010,protectionism and are exploring ways to expand trade ,UNGD
USA,2010,and commerce among nations. But we cannot — and ,UNGD
USA,2010,will not — rest until these seeds of progress grow into ,UNGD
USA,2010,"a broader prosperity, not only for all Americans but for ",UNGD
USA,2010,peoples around the world. ,UNGD
USA,2010," As for our common security, America is waging a ",UNGD
USA,2010,more effective fight against Al-Qaida’ while winding ,UNGD
USA,2010,"down the war in Iraq. Since I took office, the United ",UNGD
USA,2010,"States has removed nearly 100,000 troops from Iraq. ",UNGD
USA,2010,We have done so responsibly as Iraqis have ,UNGD
USA,2010,transitioned to lead responsibility for the security of ,UNGD
USA,2010,their country. We are now focused on building a lasting ,UNGD
USA,2010,partnership with the Iraqi people while keeping our ,UNGD
USA,2010,commitment to remove the rest of our troops by the ,UNGD
USA,2010,end of next year. ,UNGD
USA,2010, ,UNGD
USA,2010, ,UNGD
USA,2010,11 10-54827 ,UNGD
USA,2010, ,UNGD
USA,2010," While drawing down in Iraq, we have refocused ",UNGD
USA,2010,on defeating Al-Qaida and denying its affiliates safe ,UNGD
USA,2010,"haven. In Afghanistan, the United States and our allies ",UNGD
USA,2010,are pursuing a strategy to break the Taliban’s ,UNGD
USA,2010,momentum and build the capacity of Afghanistan’s ,UNGD
USA,2010,Government and security forces so that a transition to ,UNGD
USA,2010,Afghan responsibility can begin next July. And from ,UNGD
USA,2010,"South Asia to the Horn of Africa, we are moving ",UNGD
USA,2010,towards a more targeted approach — one that ,UNGD
USA,2010,strengthens our partners and dismantles terrorist ,UNGD
USA,2010,networks without deploying large American armies. ,UNGD
USA,2010, As we pursue the world’s most dangerous ,UNGD
USA,2010,"extremists, we are also denying them the world’s most ",UNGD
USA,2010,dangerous weapons and pursuing the peace and ,UNGD
USA,2010,security of a world without nuclear weapons. ,UNGD
USA,2010," Earlier this year, 47 nations embraced a work ",UNGD
USA,2010,plan to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials within ,UNGD
USA,2010,four years. We have joined with Russia to sign the most ,UNGD
USA,2010,comprehensive arms control treaty in decades. We have ,UNGD
USA,2010,reduced the role of nuclear weapons in our security ,UNGD
USA,2010,"strategy. And here, at the United Nations, we came ",UNGD
USA,2010,together to strengthen the Treaty on the Non-,UNGD
USA,2010,Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). ,UNGD
USA,2010," As part of our effort on non-proliferation, I ",UNGD
USA,2010,offered the Islamic Republic of Iran an extended hand ,UNGD
USA,2010,last year and underscored that it has both rights and ,UNGD
USA,2010,responsibilities as a member of the international ,UNGD
USA,2010,community. I also said — in this Hall — that Iran must ,UNGD
USA,2010,be held accountable if it failed to meet those ,UNGD
USA,2010,responsibilities. And that is what we have done. ,UNGD
USA,2010, Iran is the only party to the NPT that cannot ,UNGD
USA,2010,demonstrate the peaceful intentions of its nuclear ,UNGD
USA,2010,"programme, and those actions have consequences. ",UNGD
USA,2010,"Through Security Council resolution 1929 (2010), we ",UNGD
USA,2010,made it clear that international law is not an empty ,UNGD
USA,2010,promise. ,UNGD
USA,2010, Now let me be clear once more: the United States ,UNGD
USA,2010,and the international community seek a resolution to ,UNGD
USA,2010,"our differences with Iran, and the door remains open to ",UNGD
USA,2010,diplomacy should Iran choose to walk through it. But ,UNGD
USA,2010,the Iranian Government must demonstrate a clear and ,UNGD
USA,2010,credible commitment and confirm to the world the ,UNGD
USA,2010,peaceful intent of its nuclear programme.  ,UNGD
USA,2010," As we combat the spread of deadly weapons, we ",UNGD
USA,2010,are also confronting the spectre of climate change. ,UNGD
USA,2010,After making historic investments in clean energy and ,UNGD
USA,2010,"efficiency at home, we helped forge an accord in ",UNGD
USA,2010,Copenhagen that — for the first time — commits all ,UNGD
USA,2010,major economies to reduce their emissions. We are ,UNGD
USA,2010,keenly aware this is just a first step. And going ,UNGD
USA,2010,"forward, we will support a process in which all major ",UNGD
USA,2010,economies meet our responsibilities to protect the ,UNGD
USA,2010,planet while unleashing the power of clean energy to ,UNGD
USA,2010,serve as an engine of growth and development. ,UNGD
USA,2010, America has also embraced unique ,UNGD
USA,2010,responsibilities that come with our power. Since the ,UNGD
USA,2010,"rains came and the floodwaters rose in Pakistan, we ",UNGD
USA,2010,"have pledged our assistance, and we should all support ",UNGD
USA,2010,the Pakistani people as they recover and rebuild. And ,UNGD
USA,2010,"when the earth shook and Haiti was devastated by loss, ",UNGD
USA,2010,"we joined a coalition of nations in response. Today, we ",UNGD
USA,2010,honour those from the United Nations family who lost ,UNGD
USA,2010,their lives in the earthquake and commit ourselves to ,UNGD
USA,2010,stand with the people of Haiti until they can stand on ,UNGD
USA,2010,their own two feet. ,UNGD
USA,2010," Amidst this upheaval, we have also been ",UNGD
USA,2010,"persistent in our pursuit of peace. Last year, I pledged ",UNGD
USA,2010,"my best efforts to support the goal of two States, Israel ",UNGD
USA,2010,"and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security, ",UNGD
USA,2010,as part of a comprehensive peace between Israel and all ,UNGD
USA,2010,of its neighbours. We have travelled a winding road ,UNGD
USA,2010,"over the last 12 months, with few peaks and many ",UNGD
USA,2010,valleys. But this month I am pleased that we have ,UNGD
USA,2010,pursued direct negotiations between Israelis and ,UNGD
USA,2010,"Palestinians in Washington, Sharm el-Sheikh and ",UNGD
USA,2010,Jerusalem.  ,UNGD
USA,2010, Now I recognize that many are pessimistic about ,UNGD
USA,2010,this process. The cynics say that Israelis and ,UNGD
USA,2010,"Palestinians are too distrustful of each other, and too ",UNGD
USA,2010,"divided internally, to forge lasting peace. Rejectionists ",UNGD
USA,2010,on both sides will try to disrupt the process with bitter ,UNGD
USA,2010,words and with bombs and gunfire. Some say that the ,UNGD
USA,2010,gaps between the parties are too big; the potential for ,UNGD
USA,2010,talks to break down is too great; and that after decades ,UNGD
USA,2010,of failure peace is simply not possible.  ,UNGD
USA,2010, I hear those voices of scepticism. But I ask the ,UNGD
USA,2010,Assembly to consider the alternative. If an agreement ,UNGD
USA,2010,"is not reached, Palestinians will never know the pride ",UNGD
USA,2010,and dignity that comes with their own State. Israelis ,UNGD
USA,2010,will never know the certainty and security that comes ,UNGD
USA,2010,with sovereign and stable neighbours who are ,UNGD
USA,2010,committed to coexistence. The hard realities of ,UNGD
USA,2010,demography will take over. More blood will be shed. ,UNGD
USA,2010,This Holy Land will remain a symbol of our ,UNGD
USA,2010,"differences, instead of our common humanity.  ",UNGD
USA,2010,  ,UNGD
USA,2010, ,UNGD
USA,2010,10-54827 12 ,UNGD
USA,2010, ,UNGD
USA,2010, I refuse to accept that future. We all have a choice ,UNGD
USA,2010,to make. Each of us must choose the path of peace. Of ,UNGD
USA,2010,"course, that responsibility begins with the parties ",UNGD
USA,2010,"themselves, who must answer the call of history. ",UNGD
USA,2010,"Earlier this month, at the White House, I was struck by ",UNGD
USA,2010,the words of both the Israeli and Palestinian leaders. ,UNGD
USA,2010,"Prime Minister Netanyahu said, “I came here today to ",UNGD
USA,2010,find an historic compromise that will enable both ,UNGD
USA,2010,"peoples to live in peace, security and dignity”. ",UNGD
USA,2010,"President Abbas said, “We will spare no effort and we ",UNGD
USA,2010,will work diligently and tirelessly to ensure these ,UNGD
USA,2010,negotiations achieve their cause”. ,UNGD
USA,2010," These words must now be followed by action, ",UNGD
USA,2010,and I believe that both leaders have the courage to do ,UNGD
USA,2010,so. But the road that they have to travel is exceedingly ,UNGD
USA,2010,"difficult, which is why I call upon Israelis and ",UNGD
USA,2010,Palestinians — and the world — to rally behind the ,UNGD
USA,2010,goal that these leaders now share.  ,UNGD
USA,2010," We know that there will be tests along the way, ",UNGD
USA,2010,and that one test is fast approaching. Israel’s settlement ,UNGD
USA,2010,moratorium has made a difference on the ground and ,UNGD
USA,2010,improved the atmosphere for talks. ,UNGD
USA,2010, And our position on this issue is well known. We ,UNGD
USA,2010,believe that the moratorium should be extended. We ,UNGD
USA,2010,also believe that talks should press on until completed. ,UNGD
USA,2010,Now is the time for the parties to help each other ,UNGD
USA,2010,overcome this obstacle. Now is the time to build the ,UNGD
USA,2010,trust — and provide the time — for substantial ,UNGD
USA,2010,progress to be made. Now is the time for this ,UNGD
USA,2010,"opportunity to be seized, so that it does not slip away.  ",UNGD
USA,2010," Now, peace must be made by Israelis and ",UNGD
USA,2010,"Palestinians, but we each have a responsibility to do ",UNGD
USA,2010,our part as well. Those of us who are friends of Israel ,UNGD
USA,2010,must understand that true security for the Jewish State ,UNGD
USA,2010,requires an independent Palestine — one that allows ,UNGD
USA,2010,the Palestinian people to live with dignity and ,UNGD
USA,2010,opportunity. And those of us who are friends of the ,UNGD
USA,2010,Palestinians must understand that the rights of the ,UNGD
USA,2010,Palestinian people will be won only through peaceful ,UNGD
USA,2010,means — including genuine reconciliation with a ,UNGD
USA,2010,secure Israel. ,UNGD
USA,2010, I know many in this Hall count themselves as ,UNGD
USA,2010,friends of the Palestinians. These pledges of friendship ,UNGD
USA,2010,must now be supported by deeds. Those who have ,UNGD
USA,2010,signed on to the Arab Peace Initiative should seize this ,UNGD
USA,2010,opportunity to make it real by taking tangible steps ,UNGD
USA,2010,towards the normalization that it promises Israel. ,UNGD
USA,2010, And those who speak on behalf of Palestinian ,UNGD
USA,2010,self-government should help the Palestinian Authority ,UNGD
USA,2010,"politically and financially, and in doing so help the ",UNGD
USA,2010,Palestinians build the institutions of their State. ,UNGD
USA,2010, Those who long to see an independent Palestine ,UNGD
USA,2010,must also stop trying to tear down Israel. After ,UNGD
USA,2010,"thousands of years, Jews and Arabs are not strangers in ",UNGD
USA,2010,a strange land. After 60 years in the community of ,UNGD
USA,2010,"nations, Israel’s existence must not be a subject for ",UNGD
USA,2010,debate. ,UNGD
USA,2010," Israel is a sovereign State, and the historic ",UNGD
USA,2010,homeland of the Jewish people. It should be clear to all ,UNGD
USA,2010,that efforts to chip away at Israel’s legitimacy will be ,UNGD
USA,2010,met by the unshakeable opposition of the United ,UNGD
USA,2010,States. Efforts to threaten or kill Israelis will do ,UNGD
USA,2010,nothing to help the Palestinian people. The slaughter of ,UNGD
USA,2010,innocent Israelis is not resistance; it is injustice. And ,UNGD
USA,2010,make no mistake: the courage of a man like President ,UNGD
USA,2010,"Abbas, who stands up for his people in front of the ",UNGD
USA,2010,"world under very difficult circumstances, is far greater ",UNGD
USA,2010,than those who fire rockets at innocent women and ,UNGD
USA,2010,children. ,UNGD
USA,2010, The conflict between Israelis and Arabs is as old ,UNGD
USA,2010,as the United Nations. And we can come back here ,UNGD
USA,2010,"next year, as we have for the last 60 years, and make ",UNGD
USA,2010,long speeches about it. We can read familiar lists of ,UNGD
USA,2010,grievances. We can table the same resolutions. We can ,UNGD
USA,2010,further empower the forces of rejectionism and hate. ,UNGD
USA,2010,And we can waste more time by carrying forward an ,UNGD
USA,2010,argument that will not help a single Israeli or ,UNGD
USA,2010,Palestinian child achieve a better life. We can do that. ,UNGD
USA,2010, Or we can say that this time will be different — ,UNGD
USA,2010,that this time we will not let terror or turbulence or ,UNGD
USA,2010,posturing or petty politics stand in the way. This time ,UNGD
USA,2010,"we will think, not of ourselves, but of the young girl in ",UNGD
USA,2010,Gaza who wants to have no ceiling on her dreams or ,UNGD
USA,2010,the young boy in Sderot who wants to sleep without the ,UNGD
USA,2010,nightmare of rocket fire. ,UNGD
USA,2010, This time we should draw upon the teachings of ,UNGD
USA,2010,tolerance that lie at the heart of the three great religions ,UNGD
USA,2010,that see Jerusalem’s soil as sacred. This time we should ,UNGD
USA,2010,"reach for what is best within ourselves. If we do, when ",UNGD
USA,2010,"we come back here next year, we can have an ",UNGD
USA,2010,agreement that will lead to a new State Member of the ,UNGD
USA,2010,"United Nations — an independent, sovereign State of ",UNGD
USA,2010,Palestine living in peace with Israel. ,UNGD
USA,2010, ,UNGD
USA,2010, ,UNGD
USA,2010,13 10-54827 ,UNGD
USA,2010, ,UNGD
USA,2010, It is our destiny to bear the burdens of the ,UNGD
USA,2010,challenges that I have addressed — recession and war ,UNGD
USA,2010,"and conflict. And there is always a sense of urgency, ",UNGD
USA,2010,"even emergency, that drives most of our foreign ",UNGD
USA,2010,"policies. Indeed, after millennia marked by wars, this ",UNGD
USA,2010,very institution reflects the desire of human beings to ,UNGD
USA,2010,create a forum to deal with emergencies that will ,UNGD
USA,2010,inevitably come. ,UNGD
USA,2010," But even as we confront immediate challenges, ",UNGD
USA,2010,we must also summon the foresight to look beyond ,UNGD
USA,2010,them and consider what we are trying to build over the ,UNGD
USA,2010,long term. What is the world that awaits us when ,UNGD
USA,2010,"today’s battles are brought to an end? And, that is what ",UNGD
USA,2010,I would like to talk about with the remainder of my ,UNGD
USA,2010,time today. ,UNGD
USA,2010, One of the first actions of the General Assembly ,UNGD
USA,2010,was to adopt the Universal Declaration of Human ,UNGD
USA,2010,"Rights in 1948. This Declaration begins by stating that, ",UNGD
USA,2010,“recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal ,UNGD
USA,2010,and inalienable rights of all members of the human ,UNGD
USA,2010,"family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace ",UNGD
USA,2010,in the world”.  ,UNGD
USA,2010," The idea is a simple one — that freedom, justice ",UNGD
USA,2010,"and peace for the world must begin with freedom, ",UNGD
USA,2010,justice and peace in the lives of individual human ,UNGD
USA,2010,"beings. For the United States, this is a matter of moral ",UNGD
USA,2010,"and pragmatic assessment. As Robert Kennedy said, ",UNGD
USA,2010,"“the individual man, the child of God, is the touchstone ",UNGD
USA,2010,"of value, and all society, groups, the state exist for his ",UNGD
USA,2010,benefit”.  ,UNGD
USA,2010, So we stand up for universal values because it is ,UNGD
USA,2010,the right thing to do. But we also know from ,UNGD
USA,2010,experience that those who defend these values for their ,UNGD
USA,2010,"people have been our closest friends and allies, while ",UNGD
USA,2010,those who have denied those rights — whether terrorist ,UNGD
USA,2010,groups or tyrannical Governments — have chosen to be ,UNGD
USA,2010,our adversaries. ,UNGD
USA,2010, Human rights have never gone unchallenged — ,UNGD
USA,2010,"not in any of our nations, not in our world. Tyranny is ",UNGD
USA,2010,still with us — whether it manifests itself in the ,UNGD
USA,2010,"Taliban killing girls who try to go to school, a North ",UNGD
USA,2010,"Korean regime that enslaves its own people, or an ",UNGD
USA,2010,armed group in Congo-Kinshasa that use rape as a ,UNGD
USA,2010,weapon of war. ,UNGD
USA,2010," In times of economic unease, there can also be an ",UNGD
USA,2010,"anxiety about human rights. Today, as in past times of ",UNGD
USA,2010,"economic downturn, some put human rights aside for ",UNGD
USA,2010,the promise of short-term stability or the false notion ,UNGD
USA,2010,that economic growth can come at the expense of ,UNGD
USA,2010,"freedom. We see leaders abolishing term limits, we see ",UNGD
USA,2010,"crackdowns on civil society, we see corruption ",UNGD
USA,2010,"smothering entrepreneurship and good governance, we ",UNGD
USA,2010,see democratic reforms deferred indefinitely. ,UNGD
USA,2010," As I said last year, each country will pursue a ",UNGD
USA,2010,path rooted in the culture of its own people. Yet ,UNGD
USA,2010,experience shows us that history is on the side of ,UNGD
USA,2010,liberty; that the strongest foundation lies in open ,UNGD
USA,2010,"economies, open societies, and open Governments. To ",UNGD
USA,2010,"put it simply, democracy, more than any other form of ",UNGD
USA,2010,"government, delivers for our citizens. And I believe ",UNGD
USA,2010,that truth will only grow stronger in a world where the ,UNGD
USA,2010,borders between nations are blurred. ,UNGD
USA,2010, America is working to shape a world that fosters ,UNGD
USA,2010,this openness. For the rot of a closed or corrupt ,UNGD
USA,2010,economy must never eclipse the energy and innovation ,UNGD
USA,2010,of human beings.All of us want the right to educate our ,UNGD
USA,2010,"children, to make a decent wage, to care for the sick, ",UNGD
USA,2010,and to be carried as far as our dreams and deeds will ,UNGD
USA,2010,take us. But that depends upon economies that tap the ,UNGD
USA,2010,"power of our people, including the potential of women ",UNGD
USA,2010,and girls. That means letting entrepreneurs start a ,UNGD
USA,2010,business without paying a bribe and Governments that ,UNGD
USA,2010,support opportunity instead of stealing from their ,UNGD
USA,2010,"people. And that means rewarding hard work, instead ",UNGD
USA,2010,of reckless risk-taking. ,UNGD
USA,2010," Yesterday, I put forward a new development ",UNGD
USA,2010,"policy that will pursue these goals, recognizing that ",UNGD
USA,2010,dignity is a human right and global development is in ,UNGD
USA,2010,our common interest. America will partner with nations ,UNGD
USA,2010,that offer their people a path out of poverty. And ,UNGD
USA,2010,"together, we must unleash growth that powers by ",UNGD
USA,2010,individuals and merging markets in all parts of the ,UNGD
USA,2010,globe. ,UNGD
USA,2010, There is no reason why Africa should not be an ,UNGD
USA,2010,"exporter of agriculture, which is why our food security ",UNGD
USA,2010,initiative is empowering farmers. There is no reason ,UNGD
USA,2010,why entrepreneurs should not be able to build new ,UNGD
USA,2010,"markets in every society, which is why I hosted a ",UNGD
USA,2010,"summit on entrepreneurship earlier this spring, because ",UNGD
USA,2010,the obligation of Government is to empower ,UNGD
USA,2010,"individuals, not to impede them. ",UNGD
USA,2010, The same holds true for civil society. The arc of ,UNGD
USA,2010,human progress has been shaped by individuals with ,UNGD
USA,2010,the freedom to assemble and by organizations outside ,UNGD
USA,2010,of government that insisted upon democratic change ,UNGD
USA,2010,  ,UNGD
USA,2010, ,UNGD
USA,2010,10-54827 14 ,UNGD
USA,2010, ,UNGD
USA,2010,and by free media that held the powerful accountable. ,UNGD
USA,2010,We have seen that from the South Africans who stood ,UNGD
USA,2010,"up to apartheid, to the Poles of Solidarity, to the ",UNGD
USA,2010,mothers of the disappeared who spoke out against the ,UNGD
USA,2010,"Dirty War, to Americans who marched for the rights of ",UNGD
USA,2010,"all races, including my own. ",UNGD
USA,2010, Civil society is the conscience of our ,UNGD
USA,2010,communities and America will always extend our ,UNGD
USA,2010,engagement abroad with citizens beyond the halls of ,UNGD
USA,2010,Government. And we will call out those who suppress ,UNGD
USA,2010,ideas and serve as a voice for those who are voiceless. ,UNGD
USA,2010,We will promote new tools of communication so ,UNGD
USA,2010,people are empowered to connect with one another ,UNGD
USA,2010,"and, in repressive societies, to do so with security. We ",UNGD
USA,2010,"will support a free and open Internet, so individuals ",UNGD
USA,2010,have the information to make up their own minds. And ,UNGD
USA,2010,it is time to embrace and effectively monitor norms ,UNGD
USA,2010,that advance the rights of civil society and guarantee ,UNGD
USA,2010,its expansion within and across borders. ,UNGD
USA,2010," Open society supports open government, but it ",UNGD
USA,2010,cannot substitute for it. There is no right more ,UNGD
USA,2010,fundamental than the right to choose your leaders and ,UNGD
USA,2010,"determine your destiny. Now, make no mistake: the ",UNGD
USA,2010,ultimate success of democracy in the world will not ,UNGD
USA,2010,come because the United States dictates it; it will come ,UNGD
USA,2010,because individual citizens demand a say in how they ,UNGD
USA,2010,are governed. ,UNGD
USA,2010," There is no soil where this cannot take root, just ",UNGD
USA,2010,as every democracy reflects the uniqueness of a nation. ,UNGD
USA,2010,"Later this fall, I will travel to Asia. And I will visit ",UNGD
USA,2010,"India, which peacefully threw off colonialism and ",UNGD
USA,2010,established a thriving democracy of over a billion ,UNGD
USA,2010,people. ,UNGD
USA,2010," I will continue to Indonesia, the world’s largest ",UNGD
USA,2010,"Muslim-majority country, which binds together ",UNGD
USA,2010,thousands of islands through the glue of representative ,UNGD
USA,2010,government and civil society. I will join the Group-of-,UNGD
USA,2010,"20 meeting on the Korean peninsula, which provides ",UNGD
USA,2010,the world’s clearest contrast between a society that is ,UNGD
USA,2010,"dynamic and open and free, and one that is imprisoned ",UNGD
USA,2010,"and closed. And I will conclude my trip in Japan, an ",UNGD
USA,2010,ancient culture that found peace and extraordinary ,UNGD
USA,2010,development through democracy. ,UNGD
USA,2010, Each of these countries gives life to democratic ,UNGD
USA,2010,principles in its own way. And even as some ,UNGD
USA,2010,"Governments roll back reform, we also celebrate the ",UNGD
USA,2010,courage of a President in Colombia who willingly ,UNGD
USA,2010,"stepped aside, or the promise of a new constitution in ",UNGD
USA,2010,Kenya.  ,UNGD
USA,2010, The common thread of progress is the principle ,UNGD
USA,2010,that government is accountable to its citizens. And the ,UNGD
USA,2010,diversity in this Hall makes clear — no one country ,UNGD
USA,2010,"has all the answers, but all of us must answer to our ",UNGD
USA,2010,own people. ,UNGD
USA,2010," In all parts of the world, we see the promise of ",UNGD
USA,2010,innovation to make government more open and ,UNGD
USA,2010,accountable. And now we must build on that progress. ,UNGD
USA,2010,"And when we gather back here next year, we should ",UNGD
USA,2010,bring specific commitments to promote transparency; ,UNGD
USA,2010,to fight corruption; to energize civic engagement; to ,UNGD
USA,2010,leverage new technology so that we strengthen the ,UNGD
USA,2010,"foundations of freedom in our own countries, while ",UNGD
USA,2010,living up to the ideals that can light the world. ,UNGD
USA,2010, This institution can still play an indispensable ,UNGD
USA,2010,role in the advance of human rights. It is time to ,UNGD
USA,2010,welcome the efforts of UN Women to protect the rights ,UNGD
USA,2010,of women around the world. ,UNGD
USA,2010, It is time for every Member State to open its ,UNGD
USA,2010,elections to international monitors and increase the ,UNGD
USA,2010,United Nations Democracy Fund. It is time to ,UNGD
USA,2010,"invigorate United Nations peacekeeping, so that ",UNGD
USA,2010,"missions have the resources necessary to succeed, and ",UNGD
USA,2010,so atrocities like sexual violence are prevented and ,UNGD
USA,2010,justice is enforced — because neither dignity nor ,UNGD
USA,2010,democracy can thrive without basic security.  ,UNGD
USA,2010, It is time to make this institution more ,UNGD
USA,2010,"accountable as well, because the challenges of the new ",UNGD
USA,2010,century demand new ways of serving our common ,UNGD
USA,2010,interests. ,UNGD
USA,2010, The world that America seeks is not one we can ,UNGD
USA,2010,build on our own. For human rights to reach those who ,UNGD
USA,2010,"suffer the boot of oppression, we need your voices to ",UNGD
USA,2010,"speak out. In particular, I appeal to those nations that ",UNGD
USA,2010,emerged from tyranny and inspired the world in the ,UNGD
USA,2010,second half of the last century — from South Africa to ,UNGD
USA,2010,South Asia; from Eastern Europe to South America. Do ,UNGD
USA,2010,"not stand idly by, do not be silent, when dissidents ",UNGD
USA,2010,"elsewhere are imprisoned and protesters are beaten, ",UNGD
USA,2010,recall your own history. Because part of the price of ,UNGD
USA,2010,our own freedom is standing up for the freedom of ,UNGD
USA,2010,others.  ,UNGD
USA,2010, That belief will guide America’s leadership in ,UNGD
USA,2010,this twenty-first century. It is a belief that has seen us ,UNGD
USA,2010,"through more than two centuries of trial, and it will see ",UNGD
USA,2010, ,UNGD
USA,2010, ,UNGD
USA,2010,15 10-54827 ,UNGD
USA,2010, ,UNGD
USA,2010,us through the challenges we face today — be they war ,UNGD
USA,2010,or recession; conflict or division. ,UNGD
USA,2010, So even as we have come through a difficult ,UNGD
USA,2010,"decade, I stand here before you confident in the ",UNGD
USA,2010,future — a future where Iraq is governed by neither a ,UNGD
USA,2010,"tyrant nor a foreign Power, and Afghanistan is freed ",UNGD
USA,2010,from the turmoil of war; a future where the children of ,UNGD
USA,2010,Israel and Palestine can build the peace that was not ,UNGD
USA,2010,possible for their parents; a world where the promise of ,UNGD
USA,2010,development reaches into the prisons of poverty and ,UNGD
USA,2010,disease; a future where the cloud of recession gives ,UNGD
USA,2010,"way to the light of renewal, and the dream of ",UNGD
USA,2010,opportunity is available to all.  ,UNGD
USA,2010, This future will not be easy to reach. It will not ,UNGD
USA,2010,"come without setbacks, nor will it be quickly claimed. ",UNGD
USA,2010,But the founding of the United Nations itself is a ,UNGD
USA,2010,"testament to human progress. Remember, in times that ",UNGD
USA,2010,"were far more trying than our own, our predecessors ",UNGD
USA,2010,chose the hope of unity over the ease of division and ,UNGD
USA,2010,made a promise to future generations that the dignity ,UNGD
USA,2010,and equality of human beings would be our common ,UNGD
USA,2010,cause. ,UNGD
USA,2010, It falls to us to fulfil that promise. And though we ,UNGD
USA,2010,"will be met by dark forces that will test our resolve, ",UNGD
USA,2010,Americans have always had cause to believe that we ,UNGD
USA,2010,can choose a better history; that we need only to look ,UNGD
USA,2010,outside the walls around us. For through the citizens of ,UNGD
USA,2010,every conceivable ancestry who make this city their ,UNGD
USA,2010,"own, we see living proof that opportunity can be ",UNGD
USA,2010,"accessed by all, that what unites us as human beings is ",UNGD
USA,2010,"far greater than what divides us, and that people from ",UNGD
USA,2010,every part of this world can live together in peace.,UNGD
USA,2011,It is a great honour for me to ,UNGD
USA,2011,be here today. I would like to talk to the General ,UNGD
USA,2011,Assembly about a subject that is at the heart of the ,UNGD
USA,2011,United Nations — the pursuit of peace in an imperfect ,UNGD
USA,2011,world. ,UNGD
USA,2011, War and conflict have been with us since the ,UNGD
USA,2011,beginning of civilization. But in the first part of the ,UNGD
USA,2011,"twentieth century, the advance of modern weaponry led ",UNGD
USA,2011,to death on a staggering scale. It was that killing that ,UNGD
USA,2011,  ,UNGD
USA,2011, ,UNGD
USA,2011,11-50692 10 ,UNGD
USA,2011, ,UNGD
USA,2011,compelled the founders of this body to build an ,UNGD
USA,2011,"institution that was focused not just on ending one war, ",UNGD
USA,2011,but on averting others; a union of sovereign States that ,UNGD
USA,2011,would seek to prevent conflict while also addressing its ,UNGD
USA,2011,causes. ,UNGD
USA,2011, No American did more to pursue that objective ,UNGD
USA,2011,than President Franklin Roosevelt. He knew that a ,UNGD
USA,2011,victory in war was not enough. As he said at one of the ,UNGD
USA,2011,very first meetings on the founding of the United ,UNGD
USA,2011,"Nations, “We have got to make not merely peace, but a ",UNGD
USA,2011,peace that will last”. ,UNGD
USA,2011, The men and women who built this institution ,UNGD
USA,2011,understood that peace is more than the absence of war. ,UNGD
USA,2011,A lasting peace — for nations and individuals — ,UNGD
USA,2011,depends upon a sense of justice and opportunity; of ,UNGD
USA,2011,dignity and freedom. It depends upon struggle and ,UNGD
USA,2011,sacrifice; on compromise and on a sense of common ,UNGD
USA,2011,humanity. ,UNGD
USA,2011," One delegate to the San Francisco Conference, ",UNGD
USA,2011,"which led to the creation of the United Nations, put it ",UNGD
USA,2011,well: ,UNGD
USA,2011, “Many people have talked as if all we had to do ,UNGD
USA,2011,to get peace was to say loudly and frequently that ,UNGD
USA,2011,we loved peace and hated war. Now we have ,UNGD
USA,2011,learned that no matter how much we love peace ,UNGD
USA,2011,"and hate war, we cannot avoid having war ",UNGD
USA,2011,brought upon us if there are convulsions in other ,UNGD
USA,2011,parts of the world”. ,UNGD
USA,2011," The fact is, peace is hard, but our people demand ",UNGD
USA,2011,"it. Over nearly seven decades, even as the United ",UNGD
USA,2011,"Nations helped avert a third world war, we still live in ",UNGD
USA,2011,a world scarred by conflict and plagued by poverty. ,UNGD
USA,2011,Even as we proclaim our love for peace and hatred of ,UNGD
USA,2011,"war, there are still convulsions in our world that ",UNGD
USA,2011,endanger us all. ,UNGD
USA,2011, I took office at a time of two wars for the United ,UNGD
USA,2011,"States. Moreover, the violent extremists who drew us ",UNGD
USA,2011,into war in the first place — Osama bin Laden and his ,UNGD
USA,2011,"Al-Qaida organization — remained at large. Today, we ",UNGD
USA,2011,have set a new direction. ,UNGD
USA,2011," At the end of this year, America’s military ",UNGD
USA,2011,operation in Iraq will be over. We will have a normal ,UNGD
USA,2011,relationship with a sovereign nation that is a member ,UNGD
USA,2011,of the community of nations. That equal partnership ,UNGD
USA,2011,will be strengthened by our support for Iraq — for its ,UNGD
USA,2011,"Government and its security forces, for its people and ",UNGD
USA,2011,their aspirations. ,UNGD
USA,2011," As we end the war in Iraq, the United States and ",UNGD
USA,2011,our coalition partners have begun a transition in ,UNGD
USA,2011,"Afghanistan. Between now and 2014, an increasingly ",UNGD
USA,2011,capable Afghan Government and security forces will ,UNGD
USA,2011,step forward to take responsibility for the future of ,UNGD
USA,2011,"their country. As they do, we are drawing down our ",UNGD
USA,2011,"own forces, while building an enduring partnership ",UNGD
USA,2011,with the Afghan people. ,UNGD
USA,2011, So let there be no doubt: the tide of war is ,UNGD
USA,2011,"receding. When I took office, roughly 180,000 Americans ",UNGD
USA,2011,were serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. By the end of ,UNGD
USA,2011,"this year, that number will be cut in half, and it will ",UNGD
USA,2011,continue to decline. This is critical for the sovereignty ,UNGD
USA,2011,"of Iraq and Afghanistan, and to the strength of the ",UNGD
USA,2011,United States as we build our nation at home. ,UNGD
USA,2011," Moreover, we are poised to end these wars from a ",UNGD
USA,2011,"position of strength. Ten years ago, there was an open ",UNGD
USA,2011,wound and twisted steel; a broken heart in the centre of ,UNGD
USA,2011,"this city. Today, as a new tower is rising at Ground ",UNGD
USA,2011,"Zero, it symbolizes New York’s renewal, even as ",UNGD
USA,2011,Al-Qaida is under more pressure than ever before. Its ,UNGD
USA,2011,"leadership has been degraded. Osama bin Laden, a man ",UNGD
USA,2011,who murdered thousands of people from dozens of ,UNGD
USA,2011,"countries, will never endanger the peace of the world ",UNGD
USA,2011,again. ,UNGD
USA,2011," Yes, this has been a difficult decade. But today ",UNGD
USA,2011,"we stand at a crossroads of history, with the chance to ",UNGD
USA,2011,move decisively in the direction of peace. To do so we ,UNGD
USA,2011,must return to the wisdom of those who created this ,UNGD
USA,2011,institution.  ,UNGD
USA,2011, The founding Charter of United Nations calls ,UNGD
USA,2011,"upon us, to unite our strength to maintain international ",UNGD
USA,2011,peace and security. Article 1 of the Universal ,UNGD
USA,2011,"Declaration of Human Rights reminds us that, “All ",UNGD
USA,2011,human beings are born free and equal in dignity and in ,UNGD
USA,2011,rights”. Those bedrock beliefs — in the responsibility ,UNGD
USA,2011,of States and the rights of men and women — must be ,UNGD
USA,2011,our guide. ,UNGD
USA,2011," In that effort, we have reason to hope. This year ",UNGD
USA,2011,has been a time of extraordinary transformation. More ,UNGD
USA,2011,nations have stepped forward to maintain international ,UNGD
USA,2011,peace and security. More individuals are claiming their ,UNGD
USA,2011,universal right to live in freedom and dignity. ,UNGD
USA,2011," Think about it. One year ago, when we met here ",UNGD
USA,2011,"in New York, the prospect of a successful referendum ",UNGD
USA,2011,in South Sudan was in doubt. But the international ,UNGD
USA,2011,community overcame old divisions to support the ,UNGD
USA,2011, ,UNGD
USA,2011, ,UNGD
USA,2011,11 11-50692 ,UNGD
USA,2011, ,UNGD
USA,2011,agreement that had been negotiated to give South ,UNGD
USA,2011,"Sudan self-determination. Last summer, as a new flag ",UNGD
USA,2011,"went up in Juba, former soldiers laid down their arms, ",UNGD
USA,2011,men and women wept with joy and children finally ,UNGD
USA,2011,knew the promise of looking to a future that they will ,UNGD
USA,2011,shape. ,UNGD
USA,2011," One year ago, the people of Côte d’Ivoire ",UNGD
USA,2011,approached a landmark election. When the incumbent ,UNGD
USA,2011,"lost and refused to respect the results, the world ",UNGD
USA,2011,refused to look the other way. United Nations ,UNGD
USA,2011,"peacekeepers were harassed, but they did not leave ",UNGD
USA,2011,"their posts. The Security Council, led by the United ",UNGD
USA,2011,"States, Nigeria and France, came together to support ",UNGD
USA,2011,the will of the people. Côte d’Ivoire is now governed ,UNGD
USA,2011,by the man who was elected to lead. ,UNGD
USA,2011," One year ago, the hopes of the people of Tunisia ",UNGD
USA,2011,were suppressed. But they chose the dignity of ,UNGD
USA,2011,peaceful protest over the rule of an iron fist. A vendor ,UNGD
USA,2011,"lit a spark that took his own life, but ignited a ",UNGD
USA,2011,"movement. In the face of a crackdown, students spelled ",UNGD
USA,2011,out the word freedom. The balance of fear shifted from ,UNGD
USA,2011,the ruler to those whom he ruled. Now the people of ,UNGD
USA,2011,Tunisia are preparing for elections that will move them ,UNGD
USA,2011,one step closer to the democracy that they deserve. ,UNGD
USA,2011," One year ago, Egypt had known one President for ",UNGD
USA,2011,"nearly 30 years. But for 18 days, the eyes of the world ",UNGD
USA,2011,"were glued to Tahrir Square, where Egyptians from all ",UNGD
USA,2011,"walks of life — men and women, young and old, ",UNGD
USA,2011,Muslim and Christian — demanded their universal ,UNGD
USA,2011,rights. We saw in those protesters the moral force of ,UNGD
USA,2011,non-violence that has lit the world from Delhi to ,UNGD
USA,2011,"Warsaw, from Selma to South Africa — and we knew ",UNGD
USA,2011,that change had come to Egypt and to the Arab world. ,UNGD
USA,2011," One year ago, the people of Libya were ruled by ",UNGD
USA,2011,the world’s longest-serving dictator. But faced with ,UNGD
USA,2011,bullets and bombs and a dictator who threatened to ,UNGD
USA,2011,"hunt them down like rats, they showed relentless ",UNGD
USA,2011,bravery. We will never forget the words of the Libyan ,UNGD
USA,2011,who stood up in those early days of the revolution and ,UNGD
USA,2011,"said, “Our words are free now”. It is a feeling one ",UNGD
USA,2011,"cannot explain. Day after day, in the face of bullets and ",UNGD
USA,2011,"bombs, the Libyan people refused to give back that ",UNGD
USA,2011,freedom. And when they were threatened by the kind ,UNGD
USA,2011,of mass atrocity that often went unchallenged in the ,UNGD
USA,2011,"past century, the United Nations lived up to its Charter. ",UNGD
USA,2011,The Security Council authorized all necessary ,UNGD
USA,2011,measures to prevent a massacre. The Arab League ,UNGD
USA,2011,called for that effort. Arab nations joined a NATO-led ,UNGD
USA,2011,coalition that halted Al-Qadhafi’s forces in their tracks. ,UNGD
USA,2011," In the months that followed, the will of the ",UNGD
USA,2011,"coalition proved unbreakable, and the will of the ",UNGD
USA,2011,Libyan people could not be denied. Forty-two years of ,UNGD
USA,2011,tyranny were ended in six months. From Tripoli to ,UNGD
USA,2011,"Misurata to Benghazi — today, Libya is free. ",UNGD
USA,2011,"Yesterday, the leaders of a new Libya took their ",UNGD
USA,2011,"rightful place beside us, and this week the United ",UNGD
USA,2011,States is reopening our embassy in Tripoli. ,UNGD
USA,2011, This is how the international community is ,UNGD
USA,2011,supposed to work — nations standing together for the ,UNGD
USA,2011,"sake of peace and security, and individuals claiming ",UNGD
USA,2011,"their rights. Now, all of us have a responsibility to ",UNGD
USA,2011,support the new Libya and the new Libyan ,UNGD
USA,2011,Government as they confront the challenge of turning ,UNGD
USA,2011,this moment of promise into a just and lasting peace ,UNGD
USA,2011,for all Libyans. ,UNGD
USA,2011, So this has been a remarkable year. The ,UNGD
USA,2011,"Al-Qadhafi regime is over. Gbagbo, Ben Ali and ",UNGD
USA,2011,Mubarak are no longer in power. Osama bin Laden is ,UNGD
USA,2011,"gone, and the idea that change could come only ",UNGD
USA,2011,through violence has been buried with him. Something ,UNGD
USA,2011,is happening in our world. The way things have been is ,UNGD
USA,2011,not the way that they will be. The humiliating grip of ,UNGD
USA,2011,corruption and tyranny is being pried open. Dictators ,UNGD
USA,2011,are on notice. Technology is putting power into the ,UNGD
USA,2011,hands of the people. Youth are delivering a powerful ,UNGD
USA,2011,rebuke to dictatorship and rejecting the lie that some ,UNGD
USA,2011,"races, some peoples, some religions and some ",UNGD
USA,2011,ethnicities do not desire democracy. The promise ,UNGD
USA,2011,written down on paper — “all human beings are born ,UNGD
USA,2011,free and equal in dignity and rights” — is closer at ,UNGD
USA,2011,hand. ,UNGD
USA,2011, But let us remember: Peace is hard. Peace is hard. ,UNGD
USA,2011,Progress can be reversed. Prosperity comes slowly. ,UNGD
USA,2011,Societies can split apart. The measure of our success ,UNGD
USA,2011,"must be whether people can live in sustained freedom, ",UNGD
USA,2011,dignity and security. And the United Nations and its ,UNGD
USA,2011,Member States must do their part to support those ,UNGD
USA,2011,basic aspirations. And we have more work to do. ,UNGD
USA,2011," In Iran, we have seen a Government that refuses ",UNGD
USA,2011,to recognize the rights of its own people. As we meet ,UNGD
USA,2011,"here today, men, women and children are being ",UNGD
USA,2011,"tortured, detained and murdered by the Syrian regime. ",UNGD
USA,2011,"Thousands have been killed, many during the holy time ",UNGD
USA,2011,of Ramadan. Thousands more have poured across ,UNGD
USA,2011,Syria’s borders. The Syrian people have shown dignity ,UNGD
USA,2011,  ,UNGD
USA,2011, ,UNGD
USA,2011,11-50692 12 ,UNGD
USA,2011, ,UNGD
USA,2011,"and courage in their pursuit of justice, protesting ",UNGD
USA,2011,"peacefully, standing silently in the streets and dying for ",UNGD
USA,2011,the same values that this institution is supposed to ,UNGD
USA,2011,stand for. And the question for us is clear: Will we ,UNGD
USA,2011,stand with the Syrian people or with their oppressors? ,UNGD
USA,2011," Already, the United States has imposed strong ",UNGD
USA,2011,sanctions on Syria’s leaders. We supported a transfer of ,UNGD
USA,2011,power that would be responsive to the Syrian people. ,UNGD
USA,2011,And many of our allies have joined in this effort. But ,UNGD
USA,2011,for the sake of Syria — and the peace and security of ,UNGD
USA,2011,the world — we must speak with one voice. There is ,UNGD
USA,2011,no excuse for inaction. Now is the time for the Security ,UNGD
USA,2011,Council to sanction the Syrian regime and to stand with ,UNGD
USA,2011,the Syrian people. ,UNGD
USA,2011," Throughout the region, we will have to respond ",UNGD
USA,2011,"to the calls for change. In Yemen, men, women and ",UNGD
USA,2011,children gather by the thousands in towns and city ,UNGD
USA,2011,squares every day with the hope that their ,UNGD
USA,2011,determination and spilled blood will prevail over a ,UNGD
USA,2011,corrupt system. America supports those aspirations. We ,UNGD
USA,2011,must work with Yemen’s neighbours and our partners ,UNGD
USA,2011,around the world to seek a path that allows for a ,UNGD
USA,2011,"peaceful transition of power from President Saleh, and ",UNGD
USA,2011,a movement to free and fair elections as soon as ,UNGD
USA,2011,possible. ,UNGD
USA,2011," In Bahrain, steps have been taken towards reform ",UNGD
USA,2011,"and accountability. We are pleased with that, but more ",UNGD
USA,2011,"is required. America is a close friend of Bahrain, and ",UNGD
USA,2011,we will continue to call on the Government and the ,UNGD
USA,2011,main opposition bloc — al-Wifaq — to pursue a ,UNGD
USA,2011,meaningful dialogue that brings peaceful change that is ,UNGD
USA,2011,responsive to the people. We believe the patriotism that ,UNGD
USA,2011,binds Bahrainis together must be more powerful than ,UNGD
USA,2011,the sectarian forces that would tear them apart. It will ,UNGD
USA,2011,"be hard, but it is possible. ",UNGD
USA,2011, We believe that each nation must chart its own ,UNGD
USA,2011,course to fulfil the aspirations of its people. America ,UNGD
USA,2011,does not expect to agree with every party or person ,UNGD
USA,2011,"who expresses themselves politically, but we will ",UNGD
USA,2011,always stand up for the universal rights that were ,UNGD
USA,2011,embraced by this Assembly. Those rights depend on ,UNGD
USA,2011,"elections that are free and fair, governance that is ",UNGD
USA,2011,"transparent and accountable, respect for the rights of ",UNGD
USA,2011,"women and minorities, and justice that is equal and ",UNGD
USA,2011,fair. That is what our people deserve. Those are the ,UNGD
USA,2011,elements of peace that can last. ,UNGD
USA,2011," Moreover, the United States will continue to ",UNGD
USA,2011,"support, with greater trade and investment, those ",UNGD
USA,2011,"nations that transition to democracy, so that freedom is ",UNGD
USA,2011,followed by opportunity. We will pursue deeper ,UNGD
USA,2011,"engagement with Governments, but also with civil ",UNGD
USA,2011,"society — students and entrepreneurs, political parties ",UNGD
USA,2011,and the press. We have banned those who abuse human ,UNGD
USA,2011,rights from travelling to our country and we have ,UNGD
USA,2011,sanctioned those who trample on human rights abroad. ,UNGD
USA,2011,And we will always serve as a voice for those who ,UNGD
USA,2011,have been silenced. ,UNGD
USA,2011," Now, I know, particularly this week, that for ",UNGD
USA,2011,"many in this Hall, there is one issue that stands as a test ",UNGD
USA,2011,of these principles and a test of American foreign ,UNGD
USA,2011,"policy, and that is the conflict between the Israelis and ",UNGD
USA,2011,the Palestinians. ,UNGD
USA,2011," One year ago, I stood at this podium and I called ",UNGD
USA,2011,"for an independent Palestine. I believed then, and I ",UNGD
USA,2011,"believe now, that the Palestinian people deserve a State ",UNGD
USA,2011,"of their own, but what I also said is that a genuine ",UNGD
USA,2011,peace can be realized only between the Israelis and the ,UNGD
USA,2011,"Palestinians themselves. One year later, despite ",UNGD
USA,2011,"extensive efforts by America and others, the parties ",UNGD
USA,2011,have not bridged their differences. Faced with this ,UNGD
USA,2011,"stalemate, I put forward a new basis for negotiations in ",UNGD
USA,2011,May of this year. That basis is clear. It is well known to ,UNGD
USA,2011,all of us here. Israelis must know that any agreement ,UNGD
USA,2011,provides assurances for their security. Palestinians ,UNGD
USA,2011,deserve to know the territorial basis of their State. ,UNGD
USA,2011, I know that many are frustrated by the lack of ,UNGD
USA,2011,progress; I assure them that I am too. But the question ,UNGD
USA,2011,is not the goal that we seek. The question is: How do ,UNGD
USA,2011,we reach that goal? And I am convinced that there is no ,UNGD
USA,2011,shortcut to the end of a conflict that has endured for ,UNGD
USA,2011,decades. Peace is hard work. Peace will not come ,UNGD
USA,2011,through statements and resolutions at the United ,UNGD
USA,2011,"Nations. If it were that easy, it would have been ",UNGD
USA,2011,"accomplished by now. Ultimately, it is the Israelis and ",UNGD
USA,2011,"the Palestinians who must live side by side. Ultimately, ",UNGD
USA,2011,it is the Israelis and the Palestinians — not us — who ,UNGD
USA,2011,must reach agreement on the issues that divide them: ,UNGD
USA,2011,"on borders and on security, on refugees and on ",UNGD
USA,2011,Jerusalem. ,UNGD
USA,2011," Ultimately, peace depends upon compromise ",UNGD
USA,2011,among people who must live together long after our ,UNGD
USA,2011,"speeches are over, long after our votes have been ",UNGD
USA,2011,"tallied. That is the lesson of Northern Ireland, where ",UNGD
USA,2011,ancient antagonists bridged their differences. That is ,UNGD
USA,2011,"the lesson of the Sudan, where a negotiated settlement ",UNGD
USA,2011,led to an independent State. And that is and will be the ,UNGD
USA,2011, ,UNGD
USA,2011, ,UNGD
USA,2011,13 11-50692 ,UNGD
USA,2011, ,UNGD
USA,2011,path to a Palestinian State — negotiations between the ,UNGD
USA,2011,parties. ,UNGD
USA,2011, We seek a future where Palestinians live in a ,UNGD
USA,2011,"sovereign State of their own, with no limit to what they ",UNGD
USA,2011,can achieve. There is no question that the Palestinians ,UNGD
USA,2011,have seen that vision delayed for too long. It is ,UNGD
USA,2011,precisely because we believe so strongly in the ,UNGD
USA,2011,aspirations of the Palestinian people that America has ,UNGD
USA,2011,invested so much time and so much effort in the ,UNGD
USA,2011,building of a Palestinian State and in the negotiations ,UNGD
USA,2011,that can deliver a Palestinian State. ,UNGD
USA,2011, But understand this as well: America’s ,UNGD
USA,2011,commitment to Israel’s security is unshakeable. Our ,UNGD
USA,2011,friendship with Israel is deep and enduring. And so we ,UNGD
USA,2011,believe that any lasting peace must acknowledge the ,UNGD
USA,2011,very real security concerns that Israel faces every ,UNGD
USA,2011,single day. ,UNGD
USA,2011, Let us be honest with ourselves: Israel is ,UNGD
USA,2011,surrounded by neighbours that have waged repeated ,UNGD
USA,2011,wars against it. Israel’s citizens have been killed by ,UNGD
USA,2011,rockets fired at their houses and suicide bombs on their ,UNGD
USA,2011,buses. Israel’s children come of age knowing that ,UNGD
USA,2011,throughout the region other children are taught to hate ,UNGD
USA,2011,"them. Israel, a small country of less than 8 million ",UNGD
USA,2011,"people, looks out at a world where leaders of much ",UNGD
USA,2011,larger nations threaten to wipe it off of the map. The ,UNGD
USA,2011,Jewish people carry the burden of centuries of exile ,UNGD
USA,2011,and persecution and fresh memories of knowing that ,UNGD
USA,2011,6 million people were killed simply because of who ,UNGD
USA,2011,they are. Those are facts. They cannot be denied. ,UNGD
USA,2011, The Jewish people have forged a successful State ,UNGD
USA,2011,in their historic homeland. Israel deserves recognition. ,UNGD
USA,2011,It deserves normal relations with its neighbours. And ,UNGD
USA,2011,friends of the Palestinians do them no favours by ,UNGD
USA,2011,"ignoring that truth, just as friends of Israel must ",UNGD
USA,2011,recognize the need to pursue a two-State solution with ,UNGD
USA,2011,a secure Israel next to an independent Palestine. ,UNGD
USA,2011, That is the truth. Each side has legitimate ,UNGD
USA,2011,"aspirations, and that is part of what makes peace so ",UNGD
USA,2011,hard. And the deadlock will be broken only when each ,UNGD
USA,2011,side learns to stand in the other’s shoes and each side ,UNGD
USA,2011,can see the world through the other’s eyes. That is ,UNGD
USA,2011,what we should be encouraging. That is what we ,UNGD
USA,2011,should be promoting. ,UNGD
USA,2011, This body — founded as it was out of the ashes ,UNGD
USA,2011,"of war and genocide, and dedicated as it is to the ",UNGD
USA,2011,dignity of every single person — must recognize the ,UNGD
USA,2011,reality that is lived by the Palestinians and the Israelis ,UNGD
USA,2011,alike. The measure of our actions must always be ,UNGD
USA,2011,whether they advance the right of Israeli and ,UNGD
USA,2011,Palestinian children to live lives of peace and security ,UNGD
USA,2011,and dignity and opportunity. And we will succeed in ,UNGD
USA,2011,that effort only if we can encourage the parties to sit ,UNGD
USA,2011,"down, to listen to each other and to understand each ",UNGD
USA,2011,other’s hopes and each other’s fears. That is the project ,UNGD
USA,2011,to which America is committed. There are no shortcuts. ,UNGD
USA,2011,And that is what the United Nations should be focused ,UNGD
USA,2011,on in the weeks and months to come. ,UNGD
USA,2011, Even as we confront these challenges of conflict ,UNGD
USA,2011,"and revolution, we must also recognize — and we must ",UNGD
USA,2011,also remind ourselves — that peace is not just the ,UNGD
USA,2011,absence of war. True peace depends on creating the ,UNGD
USA,2011,opportunity that makes life worth living. And to do ,UNGD
USA,2011,"that, we must confront the common enemies of ",UNGD
USA,2011,"humanity: nuclear weapons and poverty, ignorance and ",UNGD
USA,2011,disease. Those forces corrode the possibility of lasting ,UNGD
USA,2011,peace and together we are called upon to confront ,UNGD
USA,2011,them. ,UNGD
USA,2011," To lift the spectre of mass destruction, we must ",UNGD
USA,2011,come together to pursue the peace and security of a ,UNGD
USA,2011,world without nuclear weapons. Over the past two ,UNGD
USA,2011,"years, we have begun to walk down that path. Since ",UNGD
USA,2011,"our Nuclear Security Summit in Washington, D.C., ",UNGD
USA,2011,nearly 50 nations have taken steps to secure nuclear ,UNGD
USA,2011,"materials from terrorists and smugglers. Next March, a ",UNGD
USA,2011,summit in Seoul will advance our efforts to lock down ,UNGD
USA,2011,all of them. The New START Treaty between the ,UNGD
USA,2011,United States and Russia will cut our deployed arsenals ,UNGD
USA,2011,"to the lowest level in half a century, and our nations are ",UNGD
USA,2011,pursuing talks on how to achieve even deeper ,UNGD
USA,2011,reductions. America will continue to work for a ban on ,UNGD
USA,2011,the testing of nuclear weapons and the production of ,UNGD
USA,2011,fissile material needed to make them. ,UNGD
USA,2011, And so we have begun to move in the right ,UNGD
USA,2011,direction. And the United States is committed to ,UNGD
USA,2011,meeting our obligations. But even as we meet our ,UNGD
USA,2011,"obligations, we have strengthened the treaties and ",UNGD
USA,2011,institutions that help stop the spread of those weapons. ,UNGD
USA,2011,"And to do so, we must continue to hold accountable ",UNGD
USA,2011,those nations that flout them. ,UNGD
USA,2011, The Iranian Government cannot demonstrate that ,UNGD
USA,2011,its programme is peaceful. It has not met its obligations ,UNGD
USA,2011,and it rejects offers that would provide it with peaceful ,UNGD
USA,2011,nuclear power. North Korea has yet to take concrete ,UNGD
USA,2011,steps towards abandoning its weapons and continues ,UNGD
USA,2011,  ,UNGD
USA,2011, ,UNGD
USA,2011,11-50692 14 ,UNGD
USA,2011, ,UNGD
USA,2011,belligerent action against the South. There is a future ,UNGD
USA,2011,of greater opportunity for the people of those nations if ,UNGD
USA,2011,their Governments meet their international obligations. ,UNGD
USA,2011,But if they continue down a path that is outside ,UNGD
USA,2011,"international law, they must be met with greater ",UNGD
USA,2011,pressure and isolation. That is what our commitment to ,UNGD
USA,2011,peace and security demands. ,UNGD
USA,2011," To bring prosperity to our people, we must ",UNGD
USA,2011,promote the growth that creates opportunity. In this ,UNGD
USA,2011,"effort, let us not forget that we have made enormous ",UNGD
USA,2011,progress over the past several decades. Closed societies ,UNGD
USA,2011,gave way to open markets. Innovation and ,UNGD
USA,2011,entrepreneurship have transformed the way we live and ,UNGD
USA,2011,the things that we do. Emerging economies from Asia ,UNGD
USA,2011,to the Americas have lifted hundreds of millions of ,UNGD
USA,2011,people from poverty. It is an extraordinary ,UNGD
USA,2011,achievement.  ,UNGD
USA,2011," And yet, three years ago, we were confronted ",UNGD
USA,2011,with the worst financial crisis in eight decades. And ,UNGD
USA,2011,that crisis proved a fact that has become clearer with ,UNGD
USA,2011,each passing year. Our fates are interconnected. In a ,UNGD
USA,2011,"global economy, nations will rise or fall together. ",UNGD
USA,2011," Today, we confront the challenges that have ",UNGD
USA,2011,followed on the heels of that crisis. Around the world ,UNGD
USA,2011,recovery is still fragile. Markets remain volatile. Too ,UNGD
USA,2011,many people are out of work. Too many others are ,UNGD
USA,2011,struggling just to get by. We acted together to avert a ,UNGD
USA,2011,depression in 2009. We must take urgent and ,UNGD
USA,2011,coordinated action once more. ,UNGD
USA,2011," Here in the United States, I have announced a ",UNGD
USA,2011,plan to put Americans back to work and jump-start our ,UNGD
USA,2011,"economy, at the same time as I am committed to ",UNGD
USA,2011,substantially reducing our deficits over time. ,UNGD
USA,2011, We stand with our European allies as they ,UNGD
USA,2011,reshape their institutions and address their own fiscal ,UNGD
USA,2011,"challenges. For other countries, leaders face a different ",UNGD
USA,2011,challenge as they shift their economy towards more ,UNGD
USA,2011,"self-reliance, boosting domestic demand while slowing ",UNGD
USA,2011,inflation. So we will work with emerging economies ,UNGD
USA,2011,that have rebounded strongly so that rising standards of ,UNGD
USA,2011,living create new markets that promote global growth. ,UNGD
USA,2011,That is what our commitment to prosperity demands. ,UNGD
USA,2011," To combat the poverty that punishes our children, ",UNGD
USA,2011,we must act on the belief that freedom from want is a ,UNGD
USA,2011,basic human right. The United States has made it a ,UNGD
USA,2011,focus of our engagement abroad to help people to feed ,UNGD
USA,2011,"themselves. And today, as drought and conflict have ",UNGD
USA,2011,"brought famine to the Horn of Africa, our conscience ",UNGD
USA,2011,"calls on us to act. Together, we must continue to ",UNGD
USA,2011,provide assistance and support organizations that can ,UNGD
USA,2011,"reach those in need. And together, we must insist on ",UNGD
USA,2011,unrestricted humanitarian access so that we can save ,UNGD
USA,2011,the lives of thousands of men and women and children. ,UNGD
USA,2011,Our common humanity is at stake. Let us show that the ,UNGD
USA,2011,life of a child in Somalia is as precious as any other. ,UNGD
USA,2011,That is what our commitment to our fellow human ,UNGD
USA,2011,beings demands. ,UNGD
USA,2011," To stop disease that spreads across borders, we ",UNGD
USA,2011,must strengthen our system of public health. We will ,UNGD
USA,2011,"continue the fight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and ",UNGD
USA,2011,malaria. We will focus on the health of mothers and of ,UNGD
USA,2011,children. And we must come together to prevent and ,UNGD
USA,2011,detect and fight every kind of biological danger — ,UNGD
USA,2011,whether it is a pandemic like H1N1 or a terrorist threat ,UNGD
USA,2011,or a treatable disease. ,UNGD
USA,2011," This week, America signed an agreement with the ",UNGD
USA,2011,World Health Organization (WHO) to affirm our ,UNGD
USA,2011,"commitment to meeting that challenge. And today, I ",UNGD
USA,2011,urge all nations to join us in meeting the WHO goal of ,UNGD
USA,2011,making sure all nations have core capacities to address ,UNGD
USA,2011,public health emergencies in place by 2012. That is ,UNGD
USA,2011,what our commitment to the health of our people ,UNGD
USA,2011,demands. ,UNGD
USA,2011," To preserve our planet, we must not put off action ",UNGD
USA,2011,that climate change demands. We have to tap the power ,UNGD
USA,2011,of science to save those resources that are scarce. And ,UNGD
USA,2011,"together, we must continue our work to build on the ",UNGD
USA,2011,"progress made in Copenhagen and Cancún, so that all ",UNGD
USA,2011,the major economies represented here today follow ,UNGD
USA,2011,"through on the commitments that were made. Together, ",UNGD
USA,2011,we must work to transform the energy that powers our ,UNGD
USA,2011,economies and support others as they move down that ,UNGD
USA,2011,path. That is what our commitment to the next ,UNGD
USA,2011,generation demands. ,UNGD
USA,2011," To make sure our societies reach their potential, ",UNGD
USA,2011,we must allow our citizens to reach theirs. No country ,UNGD
USA,2011,can afford the corruption that plagues the world like a ,UNGD
USA,2011,"cancer. Together, we must harness the power of open ",UNGD
USA,2011,societies and open economies. That is why we have ,UNGD
USA,2011,partnered with countries across the globe to launch a ,UNGD
USA,2011,new partnership on open Government that helps ensure ,UNGD
USA,2011,accountability and helps to empower citizens. No ,UNGD
USA,2011,country should deny people their rights to freedom of ,UNGD
USA,2011,"speech and freedom of religion, but also no country ",UNGD
USA,2011,should deny people their rights because of whom they ,UNGD
USA,2011, ,UNGD
USA,2011, ,UNGD
USA,2011,15 11-50692 ,UNGD
USA,2011, ,UNGD
USA,2011,"love, which is why we must stand up for the rights of ",UNGD
USA,2011,gays and lesbians everywhere. ,UNGD
USA,2011, No country can realize its potential if half its ,UNGD
USA,2011,"population cannot reach theirs. This week, the United ",UNGD
USA,2011,States signed a new declaration on women’s ,UNGD
USA,2011,"participation. Next year, we should each announce the ",UNGD
USA,2011,steps we are taking to break down the economic and ,UNGD
USA,2011,political barriers that stand in the way of women and ,UNGD
USA,2011,girls. That is what our commitment to human progress ,UNGD
USA,2011,demands. ,UNGD
USA,2011," I know there is no straight line to that progress, ",UNGD
USA,2011,no single path to success. We come from different ,UNGD
USA,2011,"cultures, and carry with us different histories. But let ",UNGD
USA,2011,us never forget that even as we gather here as Heads of ,UNGD
USA,2011,"different Governments, we represent citizens who share ",UNGD
USA,2011,the same basic aspirations to live with dignity and ,UNGD
USA,2011,"freedom, to get an education and pursue opportunity, to ",UNGD
USA,2011,"love our families and love and worship our God, to live ",UNGD
USA,2011,in the kind of peace that makes life worth living. ,UNGD
USA,2011, It is the nature of our imperfect world that we are ,UNGD
USA,2011,forced to learn these lessons over and over again. ,UNGD
USA,2011,Conflict and repression will endure so long as some ,UNGD
USA,2011,people refuse to do unto others as we would have them ,UNGD
USA,2011,do unto us. Yet that is precisely why we have built ,UNGD
USA,2011,"institutions like this — to bind our fates together, to ",UNGD
USA,2011,help us recognize ourselves in each other — because ,UNGD
USA,2011,those who came before us believed that peace is ,UNGD
USA,2011,"preferable to war, and freedom is preferable to ",UNGD
USA,2011,"suppression, and prosperity is preferable to poverty. ",UNGD
USA,2011,"That is the message that comes not from capitals, but ",UNGD
USA,2011,"from citizens, from our people. ",UNGD
USA,2011, When the cornerstone of this very building was ,UNGD
USA,2011,"put in place, President Truman came here to New York ",UNGD
USA,2011,"and said, “The United Nations is essentially an ",UNGD
USA,2011,expression of the moral nature of man’s aspirations” — ,UNGD
USA,2011,the moral nature of man’s aspirations. As we live in a ,UNGD
USA,2011,"world that is changing at a breathtaking pace, that is a ",UNGD
USA,2011,lesson that we must never forget. ,UNGD
USA,2011," Peace is hard, but we know that it is possible. So, ",UNGD
USA,2011,"together, let us be resolved to see that it is defined by ",UNGD
USA,2011,"our hopes and not by our fears. Together, let us make ",UNGD
USA,2011,"peace — but a peace, most importantly, that will last.",UNGD
USA,2012,I would like to begin today by,UNGD
USA,2012,telling the Assembly about an American named Chris,UNGD
USA,2012,"Stevens. Chris was born in a town called Grass Valley,",UNGD
USA,2012,"California, the son of a lawyer and a musician. As a",UNGD
USA,2012,"young man, Chris joined the Peace Corps and taught English in Morocco, and he came to love and respect",UNGD
USA,2012,the people of North Africa and the Middle East. He,UNGD
USA,2012,would carry that commitment throughout his life.,UNGD
USA,2012,"As a diplomat, he worked from Egypt to Syria, from",UNGD
USA,2012,Saudi Arabia to Libya. He was known for walking the,UNGD
USA,2012,"streets of the cities where he worked, tasting the local",UNGD
USA,2012,"food, meeting as many people as he could, speaking",UNGD
USA,2012,"Arabic, listening with a broad smile. Chris went to",UNGD
USA,2012,"Benghazi, arriving on a cargo ship, in the early days",UNGD
USA,2012,"of the Libyan revolution. As America’s representative,",UNGD
USA,2012,he helped the Libyan people as they coped with violent,UNGD
USA,2012,"conflict, cared for the wounded and crafted a vision",UNGD
USA,2012,for the future in which the rights of all Libyans would,UNGD
USA,2012,"be respected. After the revolution, he supported the",UNGD
USA,2012,birth of a new democracy as Libyans held elections and,UNGD
USA,2012,built new institutions and began to move forward after,UNGD
USA,2012,decades of dictatorship.,UNGD
USA,2012,Chris Stevens loved his work. He took pride in the,UNGD
USA,2012,"country he served, and he saw dignity in the people that",UNGD
USA,2012,he met.,UNGD
USA,2012,"Two weeks ago, he travelled to Benghazi to review",UNGD
USA,2012,plans to establish a new cultural center and modernize,UNGD
USA,2012,a hospital. That is when America’s compound came,UNGD
USA,2012,"under attack. Along with three of his colleagues, Chris",UNGD
USA,2012,was killed in the city that he had helped to save. He was,UNGD
USA,2012,52 years old.,UNGD
USA,2012,I tell this story because Chris Stevens embodied,UNGD
USA,2012,the best of America. Like his fellow Foreign Service,UNGD
USA,2012,"officers, he built bridges across oceans and cultures and",UNGD
USA,2012,was deeply invested in the international cooperation,UNGD
USA,2012,that the United Nations represents. He acted with,UNGD
USA,2012,"humility, but he also stood up for a set of principles, a",UNGD
USA,2012,belief that individuals should be free to determine their,UNGD
USA,2012,"own destiny and live with liberty, dignity, justice and",UNGD
USA,2012,opportunity.,UNGD
USA,2012,The attacks on the American civilians in Benghazi,UNGD
USA,2012,were attacks on America. We are grateful for the,UNGD
USA,2012,assistance we received from the Libyan Government,UNGD
USA,2012,and from the Libyan people. There should be no doubt,UNGD
USA,2012,that we will be relentless in tracking down the killers,UNGD
USA,2012,"and bringing them to justice. I also appreciate that,",UNGD
USA,2012,"in recent days, the leaders of other countries in the",UNGD
USA,2012,"region — including Egypt, Tunisia and Yemen — have",UNGD
USA,2012,taken steps to secure our diplomatic facilities and called,UNGD
USA,2012,for calm. So have religious authorities around the globe.,UNGD
USA,2012,But it should be understood that the attacks of the,UNGD
USA,2012,last two weeks are not simply an assault on America.,UNGD
USA,2012,,UNGD
USA,2012,They are also an assault on the very ideals upon which,UNGD
USA,2012,the United Nations was founded — the notion that people,UNGD
USA,2012,can resolve their differences peacefully; that diplomacy,UNGD
USA,2012,"can take the place of war, and that, in an interdependent",UNGD
USA,2012,"world, all of us have a stake in working towards greater",UNGD
USA,2012,opportunity and security for our citizens.,UNGD
USA,2012,"If we are serious about upholding those ideals, it",UNGD
USA,2012,will not be enough to put more guards in front of an,UNGD
USA,2012,Embassy or to put out statements of regret and wait for,UNGD
USA,2012,"the outrage to pass. If we are serious about those ideals,",UNGD
USA,2012,we must speak honestly about the deeper causes of the,UNGD
USA,2012,"crisis, because we face a choice between the forces that",UNGD
USA,2012,would drive us apart and the hopes we hold in common.,UNGD
USA,2012,"Today, we must affirm that our future will be",UNGD
USA,2012,"determined by people like Chris Stevens, and not by",UNGD
USA,2012,"his killers. Today, we must declare that such violence",UNGD
USA,2012,and intolerance has no place among our United Nations.,UNGD
USA,2012,It has been less than two years since a vendor in,UNGD
USA,2012,Tunisia set himself on fire to protest the oppressive,UNGD
USA,2012,corruption in his country and sparked what became,UNGD
USA,2012,"known as the Arab Spring. Since then, the world has",UNGD
USA,2012,been captivated by the transformation that has taken,UNGD
USA,2012,"place, and the United States has supported the forces",UNGD
USA,2012,of change.,UNGD
USA,2012,We were inspired by the Tunisian protests that,UNGD
USA,2012,"toppled a dictator, because we recognized our own",UNGD
USA,2012,beliefs in the aspirations of the men and women who,UNGD
USA,2012,took to the streets.,UNGD
USA,2012,"We supported change in Egypt, because our",UNGD
USA,2012,support for democracy ultimately put us on the side of,UNGD
USA,2012,the people.,UNGD
USA,2012,"We welcomed a transition of leadership in Yemen,",UNGD
USA,2012,because the interests of the people were no longer being,UNGD
USA,2012,served by a corrupt status quo.,UNGD
USA,2012,We intervened in Libya alongside a broad coalition,UNGD
USA,2012,and with the mandate of the United Nations Security,UNGD
USA,2012,"Council, because we had the ability to stop the",UNGD
USA,2012,slaughter of innocents and because we believed that the,UNGD
USA,2012,aspirations of the people were more powerful than a,UNGD
USA,2012,tyrant.,UNGD
USA,2012,"And as we meet here, we again declare that the",UNGD
USA,2012,"regime of Bashar Al-Assad must come to an end, so",UNGD
USA,2012,that the suffering of the Syrian people can stop and a,UNGD
USA,2012,new dawn can begin.,UNGD
USA,2012,We have taken those positions because we believe,UNGD
USA,2012,that freedom and self-determination are not unique to one culture. Those values are not simply American,UNGD
USA,2012,values or Western values — they are universal values.,UNGD
USA,2012,And even as there will be huge challenges that come,UNGD
USA,2012,"with a transition to democracy, I am convinced that,",UNGD
USA,2012,"ultimately, Government of the people, by the people and",UNGD
USA,2012,"for the people is more likely to bring about the stability,",UNGD
USA,2012,prosperity and individual opportunity that serve as the,UNGD
USA,2012,basis for peace in our world.,UNGD
USA,2012,"So, let us remember that this is a season of progress.",UNGD
USA,2012,"For the first time in decades, Tunisians, Egyptians and",UNGD
USA,2012,Libyans voted for new leaders in elections that were,UNGD
USA,2012,"credible, competitive and fair. That democratic spirit",UNGD
USA,2012,has not been restricted to the Arab world. Over the past,UNGD
USA,2012,"year, we have seen peaceful transitions of power in",UNGD
USA,2012,Malawi and Senegal and a new President in Somalia.,UNGD
USA,2012,"In Burma, a President has freed political prisoners and",UNGD
USA,2012,"opened a closed society, a courageous dissident has",UNGD
USA,2012,"been elected to Parliament, and people look forward to",UNGD
USA,2012,"further reform. Around the globe, people are making",UNGD
USA,2012,"their voices heard, insisting on their innate dignity and",UNGD
USA,2012,the right to determine their future.,UNGD
USA,2012,And yet the turmoil of recent weeks reminds us that,UNGD
USA,2012,the path to democracy does not end with the casting,UNGD
USA,2012,"of a ballot. Nelson Mandela once said, “To be free is",UNGD
USA,2012,"not merely to cast off one’s chains, but to live in a way",UNGD
USA,2012,that respects and enhances the freedom of others”. True,UNGD
USA,2012,democracy demands that citizens cannot be thrown in,UNGD
USA,2012,jail because of what they believe and that businesses,UNGD
USA,2012,can be opened without paying a bribe. It depends on the,UNGD
USA,2012,freedom of citizens to speak their minds and assemble,UNGD
USA,2012,"without fear and on the rule of law and due process,",UNGD
USA,2012,which guarantee the rights of all people.,UNGD
USA,2012,"In other words, true democracy — real freedom — is",UNGD
USA,2012,hard work. Those in power have to resist the temptation,UNGD
USA,2012,"to crack down on dissidents. In hard economic times,",UNGD
USA,2012,countries may be tempted to rally the people around,UNGD
USA,2012,"perceived enemies at home and abroad, rather than",UNGD
USA,2012,focusing on the painstaking work of reform.,UNGD
USA,2012,"Moreover, there will always be those who reject",UNGD
USA,2012,"human progress — dictators who cling to power, corrupt",UNGD
USA,2012,"interests that depend upon the status quo, and extremists",UNGD
USA,2012,who fan the flames of hate and division. From Northern,UNGD
USA,2012,"Ireland to South Asia, from Africa to the Americas,",UNGD
USA,2012,"from the Balkans to the Pacific Rim, we have witnessed",UNGD
USA,2012,convulsions that can accompany transitions to a new,UNGD
USA,2012,"political order. At times, the conflicts arise along the",UNGD
USA,2012,"fault lines of race or tribe, and often they arise from the difficulties of reconciling tradition and faith with",UNGD
USA,2012,the diversity and interdependence of the modern world.,UNGD
USA,2012,"In every country, there are those who find different",UNGD
USA,2012,"religious beliefs threatening; in every culture, those",UNGD
USA,2012,who love freedom for themselves must ask themselves,UNGD
USA,2012,how much they are willing to tolerate freedom for,UNGD
USA,2012,others. That is what we saw play out in the last two,UNGD
USA,2012,"weeks, as a crude and disgusting video sparked outrage",UNGD
USA,2012,"throughout the Muslim world. Now, I have made it",UNGD
USA,2012,clear that the United States Government had nothing,UNGD
USA,2012,"to do with that video, and I believe its message must",UNGD
USA,2012,be rejected by all who respect our common humanity.,UNGD
USA,2012,"It is an insult not only to Muslims, but to America as",UNGD
USA,2012,"well, for as the city outside these walls makes clear, we",UNGD
USA,2012,are a country that has welcomed people of every race,UNGD
USA,2012,"and every faith. We are home to Muslims, who worship",UNGD
USA,2012,across our country. We not only respect the freedom,UNGD
USA,2012,"of religion, we have laws that protect individuals from",UNGD
USA,2012,being harmed because of how they look or what they,UNGD
USA,2012,believe. We understand why people take offence at that,UNGD
USA,2012,"video, because millions of our citizens are among those",UNGD
USA,2012,people.,UNGD
USA,2012,I know there are some who ask why we do not just,UNGD
USA,2012,ban such a video. And the answer is enshrined in our,UNGD
USA,2012,laws; our Constitution protects the right to practice free,UNGD
USA,2012,"speech. Here in the United States, countless publications",UNGD
USA,2012,"provoke offence. Like me, the majority of Americans",UNGD
USA,2012,"are Christian, and yet we do not ban blasphemy against",UNGD
USA,2012,our most sacred beliefs. As President of our country,UNGD
USA,2012,"and Commander-in-Chief of our military, I accept that",UNGD
USA,2012,"people are going to call me awful things every day, and",UNGD
USA,2012,I will always defend their right to do so.,UNGD
USA,2012,Americans have fought and died around the globe,UNGD
USA,2012,"to protect the right of all people to express their views,",UNGD
USA,2012,even views that we profoundly disagree with. We do not,UNGD
USA,2012,"do so because we support hateful speech, but because",UNGD
USA,2012,"our founders understood that without such protections,",UNGD
USA,2012,the capacity of individuals to express their own views,UNGD
USA,2012,and practise their own faith may be threatened. We do,UNGD
USA,2012,"so because in a diverse society, efforts to restrict speech",UNGD
USA,2012,can quickly become a tool to silence critics and oppress,UNGD
USA,2012,"minorities. We do so because, given the power of faith in",UNGD
USA,2012,our lives and the passion that religious differences can,UNGD
USA,2012,"inflame, the strongest weapon against hateful speech",UNGD
USA,2012,is not repression; it is more speech — the voices of,UNGD
USA,2012,"tolerance that rally against bigotry and blasphemy, and",UNGD
USA,2012,lift up the values of understanding and mutual respect.,UNGD
USA,2012,,UNGD
USA,2012,I know that not all countries in this body share,UNGD
USA,2012,that particular understanding of the protection of free,UNGD
USA,2012,"speech. We recognize that. But in 2012, at a time",UNGD
USA,2012,when anyone with a cell phone can spread offensive,UNGD
USA,2012,"views around the world with the click of a button, the",UNGD
USA,2012,notion that we can control the f low of information is,UNGD
USA,2012,obsolete. The question then is how do we respond? And,UNGD
USA,2012,on this we must agree: there is no speech that justifies,UNGD
USA,2012,mindless violence. There are no words that excuse the,UNGD
USA,2012,killing of innocents. There is no video that justifies,UNGD
USA,2012,an attack on an embassy. There is no slander that,UNGD
USA,2012,provides an excuse for people to burn a restaurant in,UNGD
USA,2012,"Lebanon, or destroy a school in Tunis, or cause death",UNGD
USA,2012,and destruction in Pakistan. In our modern world with,UNGD
USA,2012,"modern technologies, for us to respond in that way to",UNGD
USA,2012,hateful speech empowers any individual who engages,UNGD
USA,2012,in such speech to create chaos around the world. We,UNGD
USA,2012,empower the worst of us if that is how we respond.,UNGD
USA,2012,"More broadly, the events of the past two weeks also",UNGD
USA,2012,speak to the need for all of us to honestly address the,UNGD
USA,2012,"tensions between the West and the Arab world, which",UNGD
USA,2012,"is moving towards democracy. Now, let me be clear:",UNGD
USA,2012,"just as we cannot solve every problem in the world, the",UNGD
USA,2012,United States has not and will not seek to dictate the,UNGD
USA,2012,outcome of democratic transitions abroad. We do not,UNGD
USA,2012,"expect other nations to agree with us on every issue,",UNGD
USA,2012,nor do we assume that the violence of the past weeks or,UNGD
USA,2012,the hateful speech of some individuals represents the,UNGD
USA,2012,"views of the overwhelming majority of Muslims, any",UNGD
USA,2012,more than the views of the people who produced that,UNGD
USA,2012,video represent those of Americans.,UNGD
USA,2012,"However, I do believe that it is the obligation of all",UNGD
USA,2012,leaders in all countries to speak out forcefully against,UNGD
USA,2012,violence and extremism. It is time to marginalize those,UNGD
USA,2012,"who, even when not directly resorting to violence, use",UNGD
USA,2012,"hatred of America, or the West, or Israel, as the central",UNGD
USA,2012,organizing principle of politics. For that only gives,UNGD
USA,2012,"cover, and sometimes provides an excuse, for those who",UNGD
USA,2012,do resort to violence.,UNGD
USA,2012,"That brand of politics, one that pits East against",UNGD
USA,2012,"West, and South against North, Muslims against",UNGD
USA,2012,"Christians and Hindus and Jews, cannot deliver on the",UNGD
USA,2012,"promise of freedom. To young people, it offers only",UNGD
USA,2012,false hope. Burning an American f lag does nothing to,UNGD
USA,2012,provide a child with an education. Smashing apart a,UNGD
USA,2012,restaurant does not fill an empty stomach. Attacking,UNGD
USA,2012,an embassy will not create a single job. That brand of,UNGD
USA,2012,politics only makes it harder to achieve what we must,UNGD
USA,2012,"do together, namely, to educate our children and create the opportunities that they deserve; protect human",UNGD
USA,2012,rights and extend democracy’s promise.,UNGD
USA,2012,It should be understood that America will never,UNGD
USA,2012,retreat from the world. We will bring to justice those,UNGD
USA,2012,"who harm our citizens and our friends, and we will",UNGD
USA,2012,stand with our allies. We are willing to partner with,UNGD
USA,2012,countries around the world to deepen ties of trade,UNGD
USA,2012,"and investment, science and technology, energy and",UNGD
USA,2012,development — all efforts that can spark economic,UNGD
USA,2012,growth for all our peoples and stabilize democratic,UNGD
USA,2012,change.,UNGD
USA,2012,But such efforts depend on a spirit of mutual,UNGD
USA,2012,interest and mutual respect. No Government or,UNGD
USA,2012,"company, no school or non-governmental organization",UNGD
USA,2012,will be confident working in a country where its people,UNGD
USA,2012,"are endangered. For partnerships to be effective,",UNGD
USA,2012,our citizens must be secure and our efforts must be,UNGD
USA,2012,welcomed. A politics based only on anger — one based,UNGD
USA,2012,on dividing the world between us and them — not,UNGD
USA,2012,"only sets back international cooperation, it ultimately",UNGD
USA,2012,undermines those who tolerate it. All of us have an,UNGD
USA,2012,interest in standing up to those forces.,UNGD
USA,2012,Let us remember that Muslims have suffered the,UNGD
USA,2012,most at the hands of extremism. On the same day that,UNGD
USA,2012,"our civilians were killed in Benghazi, a Turkish police",UNGD
USA,2012,officer was murdered in Istanbul only days before his,UNGD
USA,2012,wedding; more than 10 Yemenis were killed in a car,UNGD
USA,2012,bomb in Sana’a; several Afghan children were mourned,UNGD
USA,2012,by their parents just days after they were killed by,UNGD
USA,2012,a suicide bomber in Kabul. The impulse towards,UNGD
USA,2012,intolerance and violence may initially be focused on the,UNGD
USA,2012,"West, but over time it cannot be contained. The same",UNGD
USA,2012,impulses towards extremism are used to justify war,UNGD
USA,2012,"between Sunni and Shia, between tribes and clans. It",UNGD
USA,2012,leads not to strength and prosperity but to chaos. In less,UNGD
USA,2012,"than two years, we have seen largely peaceful protests",UNGD
USA,2012,bring more change to Muslim-majority countries than,UNGD
USA,2012,a decade of violence. And extremists understand this.,UNGD
USA,2012,Because they have nothing to offer to improve the lives,UNGD
USA,2012,"of people, violence is their only way to stay relevant.",UNGD
USA,2012,They do not build; they only destroy.,UNGD
USA,2012,It is time to leave the call to violence and the politics,UNGD
USA,2012,"of division behind. On so many issues, we face a choice",UNGD
USA,2012,between the promise of the future or the prisons of the,UNGD
USA,2012,past. And we cannot afford to get it wrong. We must,UNGD
USA,2012,seize this moment. And America stands ready to work,UNGD
USA,2012,with all who are willing to embrace a better future.,UNGD
USA,2012,The future must not belong to those who target Coptic Christians in Egypt; it must be claimed by those in,UNGD
USA,2012,"Tahrir Square who chanted, “Muslims, Christians, we",UNGD
USA,2012,are one.” The future must not belong to those who bully,UNGD
USA,2012,"women; it must be shaped by girls who go to school,",UNGD
USA,2012,and those who stand for a world where our daughters,UNGD
USA,2012,can live their dreams just like our sons.,UNGD
USA,2012,The future must not belong to those corrupt few,UNGD
USA,2012,who steal a country’s resources; it must be won by the,UNGD
USA,2012,"students and entrepreneurs, the workers and business",UNGD
USA,2012,owners who seek a broader prosperity for all people.,UNGD
USA,2012,Those are the women and men that America stands,UNGD
USA,2012,with; theirs is the vision we will support.,UNGD
USA,2012,The future must not belong to those who slander,UNGD
USA,2012,"the Prophet of Islam. But to be credible, those who",UNGD
USA,2012,condemn that slander must also condemn the hate we,UNGD
USA,2012,"see in the images of Jesus Christ that are desecrated,",UNGD
USA,2012,"or churches that are destroyed, or the Holocaust that is",UNGD
USA,2012,denied.,UNGD
USA,2012,Let us condemn incitement against Sufi Muslims,UNGD
USA,2012,and Shia pilgrims. It is time to heed the words of,UNGD
USA,2012,Gandhi: “Intolerance is itself a form of violence and,UNGD
USA,2012,an obstacle to the growth of a true democratic spirit”.,UNGD
USA,2012,Together we must work towards a world where we are,UNGD
USA,2012,"strengthened by our differences, not defined by them.",UNGD
USA,2012,That is what America embodies; that is the vision that,UNGD
USA,2012,we will support.,UNGD
USA,2012,"Among Israelis and Palestinians, the future must",UNGD
USA,2012,not belong to those who turn their backs on the prospect,UNGD
USA,2012,of peace. Let us leave behind those who thrive on,UNGD
USA,2012,"conflict, those who reject the right of Israel to exist.",UNGD
USA,2012,"The road is hard, but the destination is clear: a secure,",UNGD
USA,2012,"Jewish State of Israel and an independent, prosperous",UNGD
USA,2012,Palestine. Understanding that such a peace must come,UNGD
USA,2012,"through a just agreement between the parties, America",UNGD
USA,2012,will walk alongside all who are prepared to make that,UNGD
USA,2012,journey.,UNGD
USA,2012,"In Syria, the future must not belong to a dictator",UNGD
USA,2012,who massacres his people. If there is a cause that cries,UNGD
USA,2012,"out for protest in the world today, peaceful protest, it",UNGD
USA,2012,is a regime that tortures children and shoots rockets,UNGD
USA,2012,at apartment buildings. We must remain engaged to,UNGD
USA,2012,ensure that what began with citizens demanding their,UNGD
USA,2012,rights does not end in a cycle of sectarian violence.,UNGD
USA,2012,"Together, we must stand with those Syrians who",UNGD
USA,2012,believe in a different vision: a Syria that is united and,UNGD
USA,2012,"inclusive, where children do not need to fear their own",UNGD
USA,2012,"Government and all Syrians have a say in how they are governed, Sunnis and Alawites, Kurds and Christians.",UNGD
USA,2012,That is what America stands for. That is the outcome,UNGD
USA,2012,"that we will work for, with sanctions and consequences",UNGD
USA,2012,"for those who persecute, and assistance and support",UNGD
USA,2012,"for those who work for this common good, because we",UNGD
USA,2012,believe that the Syrians who embrace this vision will,UNGD
USA,2012,have the strength and the legitimacy to lead.,UNGD
USA,2012,"In Iran, we see where the path of a violent and",UNGD
USA,2012,unaccountable ideology leads. The Iranian people,UNGD
USA,2012,"have a remarkable and ancient history, and many",UNGD
USA,2012,Iranians wish to enjoy peace and prosperity alongside,UNGD
USA,2012,their neighbours. But just as it restricts the rights of,UNGD
USA,2012,"its own people, the Iranian Government continues to",UNGD
USA,2012,prop up a dictator in Damascus and supports terrorist,UNGD
USA,2012,"groups abroad. Time and again, it has failed to take the",UNGD
USA,2012,opportunity to demonstrate that its nuclear programme,UNGD
USA,2012,is peaceful and to meet its obligations to the United,UNGD
USA,2012,Nations.,UNGD
USA,2012,So let me be clear. America wants to resolve this,UNGD
USA,2012,"issue through diplomacy, and we believe that there",UNGD
USA,2012,is still time and space to do so. But that time is not,UNGD
USA,2012,unlimited. We respect the right of nations to access,UNGD
USA,2012,"peaceful nuclear power, but one of the purposes of the",UNGD
USA,2012,United Nations is to see that we harness that power for,UNGD
USA,2012,peace. Make no mistake: a nuclear-armed Iran is not a,UNGD
USA,2012,challenge that can be contained. It would threaten the,UNGD
USA,2012,"elimination of Israel, the security of Gulf nations and",UNGD
USA,2012,the stability of the global economy. It risks triggering,UNGD
USA,2012,a nuclear-arms race in the region and the unravelling,UNGD
USA,2012,of the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear,UNGD
USA,2012,Weapons. That is why a coalition of countries is holding,UNGD
USA,2012,"the Iranian Government accountable, and that is why",UNGD
USA,2012,the United States will do what we must to prevent Iran,UNGD
USA,2012,from obtaining a nuclear weapon.,UNGD
USA,2012,We know from painful experience that the path,UNGD
USA,2012,to security and prosperity does not lie outside the,UNGD
USA,2012,boundaries of international law and respect for human,UNGD
USA,2012,"rights. That is why this institution was established, from",UNGD
USA,2012,the rubble of conflict. That is why liberty triumphed,UNGD
USA,2012,"over tyranny in the cold war, and that is the lesson of",UNGD
USA,2012,the last two decades as well.,UNGD
USA,2012,History shows that peace and progress come to,UNGD
USA,2012,those who make the right choices. Nations in every part,UNGD
USA,2012,"of the world have travelled this difficult path. Europe,",UNGD
USA,2012,"the bloodiest battlefield of the twentieth century, is",UNGD
USA,2012,"united, free and at peace. From Brazil to South Africa,",UNGD
USA,2012,"from Turkey to South Korea, from India to Indonesia,",UNGD
USA,2012,"people of different races, religions and traditions have lifted millions out of poverty, while respecting the",UNGD
USA,2012,rights of their citizens and meeting their responsibilities,UNGD
USA,2012,as nations.,UNGD
USA,2012,It is because of the progress that I have witnessed,UNGD
USA,2012,"in my own lifetime, the progress that I have witnessed",UNGD
USA,2012,"after nearly four years as President, that I remain ever",UNGD
USA,2012,hopeful about the world that we live in. The war in,UNGD
USA,2012,Iraq is over. American troops have come home. We,UNGD
USA,2012,"have begun a transition in Afghanistan, and America",UNGD
USA,2012,and our allies will end our war on schedule in 2014.,UNGD
USA,2012,"Al-Qaida has been weakened, and Osama bin Laden",UNGD
USA,2012,is no more. Nations have come together to lock down,UNGD
USA,2012,"nuclear materials, and America and Russia are reducing",UNGD
USA,2012,"our arsenals. We have seen hard choices made, from",UNGD
USA,2012,"Naypyidaw to Cairo to Abidjan, to put more power in",UNGD
USA,2012,the hands of citizens.,UNGD
USA,2012,"At a time of economic challenge, the world",UNGD
USA,2012,has come together to broaden prosperity. Through,UNGD
USA,2012,"the Group of 20, we have partnered with emerging",UNGD
USA,2012,countries to keep the world on the path of recovery.,UNGD
USA,2012,America has pursued a development agenda that fuels,UNGD
USA,2012,"growth and breaks dependency, and has worked with",UNGD
USA,2012,African leaders to help them feed their nations. New,UNGD
USA,2012,partnerships have been forged to combat corruption and,UNGD
USA,2012,"promote government that is open and transparent, and",UNGD
USA,2012,new commitments have been made through the Equal,UNGD
USA,2012,Futures Partnership to ensure that women and girls can,UNGD
USA,2012,fully participate in politics and pursue opportunity.,UNGD
USA,2012,"Later today, I will discuss our efforts to combat the",UNGD
USA,2012,scourge of human trafficking.,UNGD
USA,2012,All those things give me hope. But what gives,UNGD
USA,2012,"me the most hope is not the actions taken by us, not",UNGD
USA,2012,the actions of leaders; it is the people that I have,UNGD
USA,2012,seen — the American troops who have risked their lives,UNGD
USA,2012,and sacrificed their limbs for strangers half a world,UNGD
USA,2012,"away, the students in Jakarta or Seoul who are eager",UNGD
USA,2012,"to use their knowledge to benefit mankind, the faces in",UNGD
USA,2012,a square in Prague or a parliament in Ghana who see,UNGD
USA,2012,"democracy giving voice to their aspirations, the young",UNGD
USA,2012,people in the favelas of Rio and the schools of Mumbai,UNGD
USA,2012,"whose eyes shine with promise. Those men, women,",UNGD
USA,2012,and children of every race and every faith remind me,UNGD
USA,2012,"that for every angry mob that gets shown on television,",UNGD
USA,2012,there are billions around the world who share similar,UNGD
USA,2012,hopes and dreams. They tell us that there is a common,UNGD
USA,2012,heartbeat to humanity.,UNGD
USA,2012,So much attention in our world turns to what,UNGD
USA,2012,divides us. That is what we see on the news. That is what consumes our political debates. But when you strip,UNGD
USA,2012,"it all away, people everywhere long for the freedom to",UNGD
USA,2012,determine their destiny; the dignity that comes with,UNGD
USA,2012,work; the comfort that comes with faith; and the justice,UNGD
USA,2012,that exists when Governments serve their people and,UNGD
USA,2012,not the other way around.,UNGD
USA,2012,The United States of America will always stand up,UNGD
USA,2012,"for these aspirations, for our own people and for people",UNGD
USA,2012,all across the world. That was our founding purpose.,UNGD
USA,2012,That is what our history shows. That is what Chris,UNGD
USA,2012,Stevens worked for throughout his life.,UNGD
USA,2012,I promise you this: long after the killers are brought,UNGD
USA,2012,"to justice, Chris Stevens’s legacy will live on in the lives",UNGD
USA,2012,"that he touched, in the tens of thousands who marched",UNGD
USA,2012,against violence through the streets of Benghazi; in the,UNGD
USA,2012,Libyans who changed their Facebook photo to one of,UNGD
USA,2012,"Chris; in the signs that read simply, “Chris Stevens was",UNGD
USA,2012,a friend to all Libyans”. They should give us hope. They,UNGD
USA,2012,should remind us that so long as we work for it justice,UNGD
USA,2012,"will be done, that history is on our side and that a rising",UNGD
USA,2012,tide of liberty will never be reversed.,UNGD
USA,2012,,UNGD
USA,2013,Each year we come together to ,UNGD
USA,2013,reaffirm the founding vision of this institution. For most ,UNGD
USA,2013,"of recorded history, individual aspirations were subject ",UNGD
USA,2013,"to the whims of tyrants and empires, and divisions of ",UNGD
USA,2013,"race, religion and tribe were settled through the sword ",UNGD
USA,2013,and the clash of armies. ,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,The idea that nations and peoples could come ,UNGD
USA,2013,together in peace to solve their disputes and advance a ,UNGD
USA,2013,common prosperity seemed unimaginable. It took the ,UNGD
USA,2013,awful carnage of two world wars to shift our thinking. ,UNGD
USA,2013,The leaders who built the United Nations were not naive. ,UNGD
USA,2013,They did not think that this body could eradicate all ,UNGD
USA,2013,wars. But in the wake of millions dead and continents ,UNGD
USA,2013,in rubble and with the development of nuclear weapons ,UNGD
USA,2013,"that could annihilate a planet, they understood that ",UNGD
USA,2013,humanity could not survive the course it was on. They ,UNGD
USA,2013,"gave us this institution, believing that it could allow ",UNGD
USA,2013,"us to resolve conflicts, enforce rules of behaviour and ",UNGD
USA,2013,build habits of cooperation that would grow stronger ,UNGD
USA,2013,over time.,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,"For decades, the United Nations has in fact made ",UNGD
USA,2013,"a difference, from helping to eradicate disease to ",UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,educating children and brokering peace. But like ,UNGD
USA,2013,"every generation of leaders, we face new and profound ",UNGD
USA,2013,"challenges, and this body continues to be tested. The ",UNGD
USA,2013,question is whether we possess the wisdom and the ,UNGD
USA,2013,courage as nation States and members of an international ,UNGD
USA,2013,community to squarely meet those challenges. Can the ,UNGD
USA,2013,United Nations meet the test of our time?,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,"And for much of my tenure as President, some of ",UNGD
USA,2013,our most urgent challenges have revolved around an ,UNGD
USA,2013,increasingly integrated global economy and our efforts ,UNGD
USA,2013,to recover from the worst economic crisis of our lifetime. ,UNGD
USA,2013,"Now, five years after the global economy collapsed and ",UNGD
USA,2013,thanks to coordinated efforts by the countries here ,UNGD
USA,2013,"today, jobs are being created, global financial systems ",UNGD
USA,2013,have stabilized and people are once again being lifted ,UNGD
USA,2013,"out of poverty. But this progress is fragile and unequal, ",UNGD
USA,2013,and we still have work to do together to assure that our ,UNGD
USA,2013,citizens can access the opportunities that they need in ,UNGD
USA,2013,order to thrive in the twenty-first century.,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,"Together, we have also worked to end a decade of ",UNGD
USA,2013,"war. Five years ago nearly 180,000 Americans were ",UNGD
USA,2013,"serving in harm’s way, and the war in Iraq was the ",UNGD
USA,2013,dominant issue in our relationship with the rest of the ,UNGD
USA,2013,"world. Today, all of our troops have left Iraq. Next year an ",UNGD
USA,2013,"international coalition will end its war in Afghanistan, ",UNGD
USA,2013,having achieved its mission of dismantling the core of ,UNGD
USA,2013,Al Qaida that attacked us on 9/11.,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,"For the United States, those new circumstances ",UNGD
USA,2013,have also meant shifting away from a perpetual war ,UNGD
USA,2013,footing. Beyond bringing our troops home we have ,UNGD
USA,2013,limited the use of drones so that they target only those ,UNGD
USA,2013,who pose a continuing imminent threat to the United ,UNGD
USA,2013,"States, when capture is not feasible and when there ",UNGD
USA,2013,is a near certainty of no civilian casualties. We are ,UNGD
USA,2013,transferring detainees to other countries and trying ,UNGD
USA,2013,"terrorists in courts of law, while working diligently to ",UNGD
USA,2013,close the prison at Guantanamo Bay. Just as we have ,UNGD
USA,2013,reviewed how we deploy our extraordinary military ,UNGD
USA,2013,"capabilities in a way that lives up to our ideals, we have ",UNGD
USA,2013,"begun to review the way that we gather intelligence, ",UNGD
USA,2013,so that we properly balance the legitimate security ,UNGD
USA,2013,concerns of our citizens and allies with the privacy ,UNGD
USA,2013,concerns that all people share.,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,As a result of such work and cooperation with ,UNGD
USA,2013,"allies and partners, the world is more stable than it was ",UNGD
USA,2013,five years ago. But even a glance at today’s headlines ,UNGD
USA,2013,"indicates that dangers remain. In Kenya, we have ",UNGD
USA,2013,seen terrorists target innocent civilians in a crowded ,UNGD
USA,2013,shopping mall. Our hearts go out to the families of ,UNGD
USA,2013,"those who have been affected. In Pakistan, nearly 100 ",UNGD
USA,2013,people were recently killed by suicide bombers outside ,UNGD
USA,2013,"a church. In Iraq, killings and car bombs continue to be ",UNGD
USA,2013,a terrible part of life.,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,"Meanwhile, Al-Qaida has splintered into regional ",UNGD
USA,2013,"networks and militias, which does not give them the ",UNGD
USA,2013,capacity at this point to carry out attacks like 9/11 ,UNGD
USA,2013,but does pose serious threats to Governments and ,UNGD
USA,2013,"diplomats, businesses and civilians all across the globe. ",UNGD
USA,2013,"Just as significantly, the convulsions in the Middle East ",UNGD
USA,2013,and North Africa have laid bare deep divisions within ,UNGD
USA,2013,"societies, as an old order is upended and people grapple ",UNGD
USA,2013,with what is coming next. Peaceful movements have too ,UNGD
USA,2013,often been answered by violence from those resisting ,UNGD
USA,2013,change and from extremists trying to hijack change. ,UNGD
USA,2013,"Sectarian conflict has re-emerged, and the potential ",UNGD
USA,2013,spread of weapons of mass destruction continues to cast ,UNGD
USA,2013,a shadow over the pursuit of peace.,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,Nowhere have we seen those trends converge ,UNGD
USA,2013,"more powerfully than in Syria. There, peaceful ",UNGD
USA,2013,protests against an authoritarian regime were met with ,UNGD
USA,2013,"repression and slaughter. In the face of such carnage, ",UNGD
USA,2013,many retreated to their sectarian identities — Alawite ,UNGD
USA,2013,"and Sunni, Christian and Kurd — and the situation ",UNGD
USA,2013,spiralled into civil war.,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,The international community recognized the stakes ,UNGD
USA,2013,"early on, but our response has not matched the scale of ",UNGD
USA,2013,the challenge. Aid cannot keep pace with the suffering ,UNGD
USA,2013,of the wounded and displaced. A peace process is ,UNGD
USA,2013,stillborn. America and others have worked to bolster ,UNGD
USA,2013,"the moderate opposition, but extremist groups have still ",UNGD
USA,2013,taken root to exploit the crisis.,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,"Al-Assad’s traditional allies have propped him up, ",UNGD
USA,2013,citing principles of sovereignty to shield his regime. ,UNGD
USA,2013,"On 21 August, the regime used chemical weapons in ",UNGD
USA,2013,"an attack that killed more than 1,000 people, including ",UNGD
USA,2013,"hundreds of children. Today, the crisis in Syria and the ",UNGD
USA,2013,destabilization of the region goes to the heart of broader ,UNGD
USA,2013,challenges that the international community must now ,UNGD
USA,2013,confront. How should we respond to conflicts in the ,UNGD
USA,2013,Middle East and North Africa — conflicts between ,UNGD
USA,2013,"countries, but also conflicts within them? How do we ",UNGD
USA,2013,address the choice between standing callously by while ,UNGD
USA,2013,children are subjected to nerve gas and embroiling ,UNGD
USA,2013,ourselves in someone else’s civil war? What is the role of ,UNGD
USA,2013,force in resolving disputes that threaten the stability of ,UNGD
USA,2013,a region and undermine all basic standards of civilized ,UNGD
USA,2013,conduct? And what is the role of the United Nations and ,UNGD
USA,2013,international law in meeting cries for justice?,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,"Today, I want to outline where the United States of ",UNGD
USA,2013,America stands on those issues.,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,"With respect to Syria, we believe that, as a starting ",UNGD
USA,2013,"point, the international community must enforce the ban ",UNGD
USA,2013,on chemical weapons. When I stated my willingness to ,UNGD
USA,2013,order a limited strike against the Al-Assad regime in ,UNGD
USA,2013,"response to its brazen use of chemical weapons, I did ",UNGD
USA,2013,not do so lightly. I did so because I believe that it is ,UNGD
USA,2013,in the national security interests of the United States ,UNGD
USA,2013,and in the interest of the world to meaningfully enforce ,UNGD
USA,2013,a prohibition whose origins are older than the United ,UNGD
USA,2013,Nations itself. The ban against the use of chemical ,UNGD
USA,2013,"weapons, even in war, has been agreed to by 98 percent ",UNGD
USA,2013,of humanity. It is strengthened by the searing memories ,UNGD
USA,2013,"of soldiers suffocated in the trenches, Jews slaughtered ",UNGD
USA,2013,"in gas chambers, Iranians poisoned in the many tens of ",UNGD
USA,2013,thousands.,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,The evidence is overwhelming that the Al-Assad ,UNGD
USA,2013,regime used such weapons on 21 August. United ,UNGD
USA,2013,Nations inspectors gave a clear accounting of their ,UNGD
USA,2013,findings that advanced rockets had fired large ,UNGD
USA,2013,quantities of sarin gas at civilians. Those rockets were ,UNGD
USA,2013,fired from a regime-controlled neighbourhood and ,UNGD
USA,2013,landed in opposition neighbourhoods. It is an insult to ,UNGD
USA,2013,human reason and to the legitimacy of this institution ,UNGD
USA,2013,to suggest that anyone other than the regime carried out ,UNGD
USA,2013,this attack.,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,I know that in the immediate aftermath of the attack ,UNGD
USA,2013,there were those who questioned the legitimacy of even ,UNGD
USA,2013,a limited strike in the absence of a clear mandate from ,UNGD
USA,2013,the Security Council. But without a credible military ,UNGD
USA,2013,"threat, the Security Council had demonstrated no ",UNGD
USA,2013,"inclination to act at all. However, as I have discussed ",UNGD
USA,2013,"with President Putin for over a year, most recently in ",UNGD
USA,2013,"St. Petersburg, my preference has always been to work ",UNGD
USA,2013,"for a diplomatic resolution to this issue, and in the past ",UNGD
USA,2013,"several weeks, the United States, Russia and our allies ",UNGD
USA,2013,have reached an agreement to place Syria’s chemical ,UNGD
USA,2013,weapons under international control and then destroy ,UNGD
USA,2013,them.,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,The Syrian Government took a first step by giving ,UNGD
USA,2013,"an accounting of its stockpiles. Now, there must be a ",UNGD
USA,2013,strong Security Council resolution to verify that the ,UNGD
USA,2013,"Al-Assad regime is keeping its commitments, and there ",UNGD
USA,2013,must be consequences if they fail to do so. If we cannot ,UNGD
USA,2013,"agree even on that, then that will show that the United ",UNGD
USA,2013,Nations is incapable of enforcing the most basic of ,UNGD
USA,2013,"international laws. On the other hand, if we succeed, it ",UNGD
USA,2013,will send a powerful message that the use of chemical ,UNGD
USA,2013,weapons has no place in the twenty-first century and ,UNGD
USA,2013,that this Organization means what it says.,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,Our agreement on chemical weapons should ,UNGD
USA,2013,energize a larger diplomatic effort to reach a political ,UNGD
USA,2013,settlement within Syria. I do not believe that military ,UNGD
USA,2013,action by those within Syria or by external Powers can ,UNGD
USA,2013,"achieve a lasting peace, nor do I believe that America ",UNGD
USA,2013,or any nation should determine who will lead Syria. ,UNGD
USA,2013,"That is for the Syrian people to decide. Nevertheless, a ",UNGD
USA,2013,leader who has slaughtered his own citizens and gassed ,UNGD
USA,2013,children to death cannot regain the legitimacy to lead ,UNGD
USA,2013,a badly fractured country. The notion that Syria can ,UNGD
USA,2013,return to a pre-war status quo is a fantasy. ,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,It is time for Russia and Iran to realize that insisting ,UNGD
USA,2013,on Al-Assad’s rule will lead directly to the outcome that ,UNGD
USA,2013,they fear — an increasingly violent space for extremists ,UNGD
USA,2013,"to operate in. In turn, those of us who continue to ",UNGD
USA,2013,support the moderate opposition must persuade them ,UNGD
USA,2013,that the Syrian people cannot afford a collapse of State ,UNGD
USA,2013,institutions and that a political settlement cannot be ,UNGD
USA,2013,reached without addressing the legitimate fears and ,UNGD
USA,2013,concerns of Alawites and other minorities. ,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,"We are committed to working this political track, ",UNGD
USA,2013,"and as we pursue a settlement, let us remember that ",UNGD
USA,2013,this is not a zero-sum endeavour. We are no longer in ,UNGD
USA,2013,"a cold war. There is no great game to be won, nor does ",UNGD
USA,2013,America have any interest in Syria beyond the well-,UNGD
USA,2013,"being of its people, the stability of its neighbours, the ",UNGD
USA,2013,elimination of chemical weapons and ensuring that it ,UNGD
USA,2013,does not become a safe haven for terrorists. I welcome ,UNGD
USA,2013,the influence of all nations that can help bring about a ,UNGD
USA,2013,peaceful resolution of Syria’s civil war. ,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,"As we move the Geneva process forward, I ",UNGD
USA,2013,urge all nations represented here to step up to meet ,UNGD
USA,2013,the humanitarian needs in Syria and surrounding ,UNGD
USA,2013,countries. America has committed over a billion dollars ,UNGD
USA,2013,"to that effort, and today I can announce that we will be ",UNGD
USA,2013,providing an additional $340 million. No aid can take ,UNGD
USA,2013,the place of a political resolution that gives the Syrian ,UNGD
USA,2013,"people the chance to begin rebuilding their country, but ",UNGD
USA,2013,it can help desperate people survive.,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,What broader conclusions can be drawn from ,UNGD
USA,2013,America’s policy towards Syria? I know that there are ,UNGD
USA,2013,those who have been frustrated by our unwillingness ,UNGD
USA,2013,to use our military might to depose Al-Assad and ,UNGD
USA,2013,believe that a failure to do so indicates a weakening of ,UNGD
USA,2013,America’s resolve in the region. Others have suggested ,UNGD
USA,2013,that my willingness to direct even limited military ,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,strikes to deter the further use of chemical weapons ,UNGD
USA,2013,"shows that we have learned nothing from Iraq, and that ",UNGD
USA,2013,America continues to seek control over the Middle East ,UNGD
USA,2013,for our own purposes. The situation in Syria mirrors ,UNGD
USA,2013,a contradiction that has persisted in the region for ,UNGD
USA,2013,decades. The United States is chastised for meddling in ,UNGD
USA,2013,the region and accused of having a hand in all manner ,UNGD
USA,2013,"of conspiracies. At the same time, the United States is ",UNGD
USA,2013,blamed for failing to do enough to solve the region’s ,UNGD
USA,2013,problems and for showing indifference toward suffering ,UNGD
USA,2013,Muslim populations.,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,"I realize that some of that is inevitable, given ",UNGD
USA,2013,"America’s role in the world, but such contradictory ",UNGD
USA,2013,attitudes have a practical impact on the American ,UNGD
USA,2013,people’s support for our involvement in the region ,UNGD
USA,2013,"and allow leaders in the region, and the international ",UNGD
USA,2013,"community sometimes, to avoid addressing difficult ",UNGD
USA,2013,problems themselves. So let me take this opportunity ,UNGD
USA,2013,to outline what has been United States policy towards ,UNGD
USA,2013,the Middle East and North Africa and what will be my ,UNGD
USA,2013,policy during the remainder of my presidency.,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,The United States of America is prepared to use ,UNGD
USA,2013,"all elements of our power, including military force, ",UNGD
USA,2013,to secure these core interests in the region. We will ,UNGD
USA,2013,confront external aggression against our allies and ,UNGD
USA,2013,"partners, as we did in the Gulf War. We will ensure ",UNGD
USA,2013,the free flow of energy from the region to the world. ,UNGD
USA,2013,Although America is steadily reducing its own ,UNGD
USA,2013,"dependence on imported oil, the world still depends ",UNGD
USA,2013,"upon the region’s energy supply, and a severe disruption ",UNGD
USA,2013,could destabilize the entire global economy. We will ,UNGD
USA,2013,dismantle terrorist networks that threaten our people. ,UNGD
USA,2013,"Wherever possible, we will build the capacity of our ",UNGD
USA,2013,"partners, respect the sovereignty of nations and work ",UNGD
USA,2013,"to address the root causes of terror, but when it is ",UNGD
USA,2013,necessary to defend the United States against terrorist ,UNGD
USA,2013,"attack, we will take direct action. Finally, we will not ",UNGD
USA,2013,tolerate the development or use of weapons of mass ,UNGD
USA,2013,destruction. Just as we consider the use of chemical ,UNGD
USA,2013,weapons in Syria to be a threat to our own national ,UNGD
USA,2013,"security, we reject the development of nuclear weapons ",UNGD
USA,2013,that could trigger a nuclear arms race in the region and ,UNGD
USA,2013,undermine the global non-proliferation regime.,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,"Now, to say that those are America’s core interests ",UNGD
USA,2013,is not to say that they are our only interests. We deeply ,UNGD
USA,2013,believe that it is in our interest to see a Middle East and ,UNGD
USA,2013,"North Africa that are peaceful and prosperous, and we ",UNGD
USA,2013,"will continue to promote democracy, human rights and ",UNGD
USA,2013,"open markets, because we believe that those practices ",UNGD
USA,2013,help achieve peace and prosperity. But I also believe ,UNGD
USA,2013,that we can rarely achieve those objectives through ,UNGD
USA,2013,"unilateral American action, particularly military ",UNGD
USA,2013,action. Iraq has shown us that democracy cannot ,UNGD
USA,2013,"simply be imposed by force. Rather, such objectives are ",UNGD
USA,2013,best achieved when we partner with the international ,UNGD
USA,2013,community and with the countries and peoples of the ,UNGD
USA,2013,region.,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,So what does that mean going forward? In the near ,UNGD
USA,2013,"term, America’s diplomatic efforts will focus on two ",UNGD
USA,2013,particular issues: Iran’s pursuit of nuclear weapons ,UNGD
USA,2013,and the Arab-Israeli conflict. While those issues are ,UNGD
USA,2013,"not the cause of all of the region’s problems, they have ",UNGD
USA,2013,"been a major source of instability for far too long, and ",UNGD
USA,2013,resolving them can help serve as a foundation for a ,UNGD
USA,2013,broader peace.,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,The United States and Iran have been isolated ,UNGD
USA,2013,from one another since the Islamic revolution of 1979. ,UNGD
USA,2013,That mistrust has deep roots. Iranians have long ,UNGD
USA,2013,complained of a history of United States interference ,UNGD
USA,2013,in their affairs and of America’s role in overthrowing ,UNGD
USA,2013,an Iranian Government during the cold war. On the ,UNGD
USA,2013,"other hand, Americans see an Iranian Government that ",UNGD
USA,2013,has declared the United States an enemy and directly ,UNGD
USA,2013,"or through proxies has taken Americans hostage, killed ",UNGD
USA,2013,United States troops and civilians and threatened our ,UNGD
USA,2013,ally Israel with destruction.,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,I do not believe such a difficult history can be ,UNGD
USA,2013,overcome overnight. The suspicion runs too deep. But ,UNGD
USA,2013,"I do believe that, if we can resolve the issue of Iran’s ",UNGD
USA,2013,"nuclear programme, that can serve as a major step down ",UNGD
USA,2013,"a long road towards a different relationship, one based ",UNGD
USA,2013,on mutual interests and mutual respect.,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,"Since I took office, I have made it clear, in letters ",UNGD
USA,2013,"to the Supreme Leader in Iran and, more recently, to ",UNGD
USA,2013,"President Rouhani, that America prefers to resolve its ",UNGD
USA,2013,"concerns over Iran’s nuclear programme peacefully, ",UNGD
USA,2013,although we are determined to prevent Iran from ,UNGD
USA,2013,developing a nuclear weapon. We are not seeking regime ,UNGD
USA,2013,"change, and we respect the right of the Iranian people ",UNGD
USA,2013,"to access peaceful nuclear energy. Instead, we insist ",UNGD
USA,2013,that the Iranian Government meet its responsibilities ,UNGD
USA,2013,under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear ,UNGD
USA,2013,"Weapons and Security Council resolutions. Meanwhile, ",UNGD
USA,2013,the Supreme Leader has issued a fatwa against the ,UNGD
USA,2013,"development of nuclear weapons, and President ",UNGD
USA,2013,Rouhani has just recently reiterated that the Islamic ,UNGD
USA,2013,Republic will never develop a nuclear weapon.,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,Those statements made by our respective ,UNGD
USA,2013,Governments should offer the basis for a meaningful ,UNGD
USA,2013,agreement. We should be able to achieve a resolution ,UNGD
USA,2013,that respects the rights of the Iranian people while ,UNGD
USA,2013,giving the world confidence that the Iranian programme ,UNGD
USA,2013,"is peaceful. But to succeed, conciliatory words will ",UNGD
USA,2013,have to be matched by actions that are transparent and ,UNGD
USA,2013,"verifiable. After all, it is the Iranian Government’s ",UNGD
USA,2013,choices that have led to the comprehensive sanctions ,UNGD
USA,2013,that are currently in place. That is not simply an issue ,UNGD
USA,2013,between the United States and Iran. The world has ,UNGD
USA,2013,seen Iran evade its responsibilities in the past and has ,UNGD
USA,2013,an abiding interest in making sure that Iran meets its ,UNGD
USA,2013,obligations in future.,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,But I want to be clear. We are encouraged by the ,UNGD
USA,2013,fact that President Rouhani received from the Iranian ,UNGD
USA,2013,people a mandate to pursue a more moderate course. ,UNGD
USA,2013,Given President Rouhani’s stated commitment to reach ,UNGD
USA,2013,"an agreement, I am directing John Kerry to pursue this ",UNGD
USA,2013,"effort with the Iranian Government, in close cooperation ",UNGD
USA,2013,"with the European Union, the United Kingdom, France, ",UNGD
USA,2013,"Germany, Russia and China.",UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,"The roadblocks may prove to be too great, but I ",UNGD
USA,2013,firmly believe that the diplomatic path must be tested. ,UNGD
USA,2013,"For while the status quo will only deepen Iran’s isolation, ",UNGD
USA,2013,Iran’s genuine commitment to go down a different path ,UNGD
USA,2013,"will be good for the region and the world, and will help ",UNGD
USA,2013,the Iranian people meet their extraordinary potential in ,UNGD
USA,2013,"commerce and culture, in science and education.",UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,We are also determined to resolve a conflict that ,UNGD
USA,2013,goes back even further than our differences with ,UNGD
USA,2013,Iran: the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis. ,UNGD
USA,2013,I have made it clear that the United States will never ,UNGD
USA,2013,"compromise our commitment to Israel’s security, nor ",UNGD
USA,2013,our support for its existence as a Jewish State. Earlier ,UNGD
USA,2013,"this year, in Jerusalem, I was inspired by young Israelis ",UNGD
USA,2013,"who stood up for the belief that peace was necessary, ",UNGD
USA,2013,"just and possible, and I believe that there is a growing ",UNGD
USA,2013,recognition within Israel that the occupation of the West ,UNGD
USA,2013,Bank is tearing at the democratic fabric of the Jewish ,UNGD
USA,2013,State. But the children of Israel have the right to live in ,UNGD
USA,2013,a world where the nations assembled in this body fully ,UNGD
USA,2013,recognize their country and where we unequivocally ,UNGD
USA,2013,reject those who fire rockets at their homes or incite ,UNGD
USA,2013,others to hate them.,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,"Likewise, the United States remains committed to ",UNGD
USA,2013,the belief that the Palestinian people have a right to live ,UNGD
USA,2013,in security and dignity in their own sovereign State. On ,UNGD
USA,2013,"the same trip, I had the opportunity to meet with young ",UNGD
USA,2013,Palestinians in Ramallah whose ambition and incredible ,UNGD
USA,2013,potential are matched only by the pain they feel in ,UNGD
USA,2013,having no firm place in the community of nations. They ,UNGD
USA,2013,are understandably cynical as to whether real progress ,UNGD
USA,2013,"will ever be made, and they are frustrated by their ",UNGD
USA,2013,families enduring the daily indignity of occupation. ,UNGD
USA,2013,"But they, too, recognize that two States is the only real ",UNGD
USA,2013,"path to peace, because, just as the Palestinian people ",UNGD
USA,2013,"must not be displaced, the State of Israel is here to stay.",UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,The time is now ripe for the entire international ,UNGD
USA,2013,community to get behind the pursuit of peace. Already ,UNGD
USA,2013,Israeli and Palestinian leaders have demonstrated a ,UNGD
USA,2013,willingness to take significant political risks. President ,UNGD
USA,2013,Abbas has put aside efforts to short-cut the pursuit ,UNGD
USA,2013,of peace and come to the negotiating table. Prime ,UNGD
USA,2013,Minister Netanyahu has released Palestinian prisoners ,UNGD
USA,2013,and reaffirmed his commitment to a Palestinian State. ,UNGD
USA,2013,Current talks are focused on final status issues of ,UNGD
USA,2013,"borders and security, refugees and Jerusalem.",UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,So now the rest of us must be willing to take risks ,UNGD
USA,2013,"as well. Friends of Israel, including the United States, ",UNGD
USA,2013,must recognize that Israel’s security as a Jewish and ,UNGD
USA,2013,democratic State depends upon the realization of a ,UNGD
USA,2013,"Palestinian State, and we should say so clearly. Arab ",UNGD
USA,2013,"States, and those who have supported the Palestinians, ",UNGD
USA,2013,must recognize that stability will be served only through ,UNGD
USA,2013,a two-State solution and a secure Israel. All of us must ,UNGD
USA,2013,recognize that peace will be a powerful tool to defeat ,UNGD
USA,2013,extremists throughout the region and embolden those ,UNGD
USA,2013,"who are prepared to build a better future. Moreover, ",UNGD
USA,2013,ties of trade and commerce between Israelis and Arabs ,UNGD
USA,2013,could be an engine of growth and opportunity at a ,UNGD
USA,2013,time when too many young people in the region are ,UNGD
USA,2013,languishing without work. So let us emerge from the ,UNGD
USA,2013,familiar corners of blame and prejudice. Let us support ,UNGD
USA,2013,Israeli and Palestinian leaders who are prepared to walk ,UNGD
USA,2013,the difficult road to peace.,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,Real breakthroughs on these two issues — Iran’s ,UNGD
USA,2013,nuclear programme and Israeli-Palestinian peace — would ,UNGD
USA,2013,have a profound and positive impact on the entire Middle ,UNGD
USA,2013,East and North Africa. But the current convulsions ,UNGD
USA,2013,arising out of the Arab Spring remind us that a just and ,UNGD
USA,2013,lasting peace cannot be measured only by agreements ,UNGD
USA,2013,between nations. It must also be measured by our ability ,UNGD
USA,2013,to resolve conflict and promote justice within nations. ,UNGD
USA,2013,"And by that measure, it is clear that all of us have a lot ",UNGD
USA,2013,more work to do. ,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,When peaceful transitions began in Tunisia and ,UNGD
USA,2013,"Egypt, the entire world was filled with hope. And ",UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,"although the United States, like others, was struck by ",UNGD
USA,2013,"the speed of transition, and although we did not — and ",UNGD
USA,2013,"in fact could not — dictate events, we chose to support ",UNGD
USA,2013,those who called for change. We did so based on the ,UNGD
USA,2013,belief that while these transitions will be hard and take ,UNGD
USA,2013,"time, societies based upon democracy and openness ",UNGD
USA,2013,and the dignity of the individual will ultimately be ,UNGD
USA,2013,"more stable, more prosperous and more peaceful. ",UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,"Over the last few years, particularly in Egypt, ",UNGD
USA,2013,we have seen just how hard this transition will be. ,UNGD
USA,2013,"Mohammed Morsi was democratically elected, but ",UNGD
USA,2013,proved unwilling or unable to govern in a way that was ,UNGD
USA,2013,fully inclusive. The interim Government that replaced ,UNGD
USA,2013,him responded to the desires of millions of Egyptians ,UNGD
USA,2013,"who believed the revolution had taken a wrong turn, but ",UNGD
USA,2013,"it, too, has made decisions inconsistent with inclusive ",UNGD
USA,2013,"democracy, through an emergency law and restrictions ",UNGD
USA,2013,"on the press, civil society and opposition parties.",UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,"Of course, America has been attacked by all sides ",UNGD
USA,2013,"of this internal conflict, simultaneously accused of ",UNGD
USA,2013,supporting the Muslim Brotherhood and engineering ,UNGD
USA,2013,"its removal from power. In fact, the United States has ",UNGD
USA,2013,purposely avoided choosing sides. Our overriding ,UNGD
USA,2013,interest throughout these past few years has been to ,UNGD
USA,2013,encourage a Government that legitimately reflects ,UNGD
USA,2013,the will of the Egyptian people and recognizes true ,UNGD
USA,2013,"democracy as requiring a respect for minority rights, ",UNGD
USA,2013,"the rule of law, freedom of speech and assembly, and a ",UNGD
USA,2013,strong civil society.,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,"That remains our interest today. And so, going ",UNGD
USA,2013,"forward, the United States will maintain a constructive ",UNGD
USA,2013,relationship with the interim Government that promotes ,UNGD
USA,2013,core interests like the Camp David Accords and counter-,UNGD
USA,2013,terrorism. We will continue support in areas such as ,UNGD
USA,2013,education that directly benefit the Egyptian people. ,UNGD
USA,2013,But we have not proceeded with the delivery of certain ,UNGD
USA,2013,"military systems, and our support will depend upon ",UNGD
USA,2013,Egypt’s progress in pursuing a more democratic path. ,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,Our approach to Egypt reflects a larger point: the ,UNGD
USA,2013,United States will at times work with Governments ,UNGD
USA,2013,that do not meet — at least in our view — the highest ,UNGD
USA,2013,"international expectations, but who work with us on our ",UNGD
USA,2013,"core interests. Nevertheless, we will not stop asserting ",UNGD
USA,2013,"principles that are consistent with our ideals, whether ",UNGD
USA,2013,that means opposing the use of violence as a means ,UNGD
USA,2013,of suppressing dissent or supporting the principles ,UNGD
USA,2013,embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human ,UNGD
USA,2013,Rights. We will reject the notion that those principles ,UNGD
USA,2013,"are simply Western exports, incompatible with Islam or ",UNGD
USA,2013,the Arab world. We believe that they are the birthright ,UNGD
USA,2013,of every person. And while we recognize that our ,UNGD
USA,2013,"influence will at times be limited, although we will be ",UNGD
USA,2013,wary of efforts to impose democracy through military ,UNGD
USA,2013,"force, and although we will at times be accused of ",UNGD
USA,2013,"hypocrisy and inconsistency, we will be engaged in the ",UNGD
USA,2013,region for the long haul. For the hard work of forging ,UNGD
USA,2013,freedom and democracy is the task of a generation. ,UNGD
USA,2013,That includes efforts to resolve sectarian tensions that ,UNGD
USA,2013,"continue to surface in places like Iraq, Bahrain and ",UNGD
USA,2013,Syria. ,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,We understand that such long-standing issues ,UNGD
USA,2013,cannot be solved by outsiders; they must be addressed ,UNGD
USA,2013,by Muslim communities themselves. But we have seen ,UNGD
USA,2013,"grinding conflicts come to an end before, most recently ",UNGD
USA,2013,"in Northern Ireland, where Catholics and Protestants ",UNGD
USA,2013,finally recognized that an endless cycle of conflict was ,UNGD
USA,2013,causing both communities to fall behind a fast-moving ,UNGD
USA,2013,world. And so we believe that those same sectarian ,UNGD
USA,2013,conflicts can be overcome in the Middle East and North ,UNGD
USA,2013,Africa. ,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,"To summarize, the United States has a hard-earned ",UNGD
USA,2013,humility when it comes to our ability to determine ,UNGD
USA,2013,events inside other countries. The notion of American ,UNGD
USA,2013,"empire may be useful propaganda, but it is not borne ",UNGD
USA,2013,out by America’s current policy or public opinion. ,UNGD
USA,2013,"Indeed, as recent debates within the United States over ",UNGD
USA,2013,"Syria clearly showed, the danger for the world is not an ",UNGD
USA,2013,America that is too eager to immerse itself in the affairs ,UNGD
USA,2013,of other countries or to take on every problem in the ,UNGD
USA,2013,region as its own. The danger for the world is that the ,UNGD
USA,2013,"United States, after a decade of war, rightly concerned ",UNGD
USA,2013,about issues back home and aware of the hostility ,UNGD
USA,2013,that our engagement in the region has engendered ,UNGD
USA,2013,"throughout the Muslim world, may disengage, creating ",UNGD
USA,2013,a vacuum of leadership that no other nation is ready to ,UNGD
USA,2013,fill.,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,I believe that such disengagement would be a ,UNGD
USA,2013,mistake. I believe that America must remain engaged ,UNGD
USA,2013,"for our own security, but I also believe that the world ",UNGD
USA,2013,"is better for it. Some may disagree, but I believe that ",UNGD
USA,2013,"America is exceptional, in part because we have shown ",UNGD
USA,2013,"a willingness, through the sacrifice of blood and ",UNGD
USA,2013,"treasure, to stand up not only for our own narrow self-",UNGD
USA,2013,"interest, but for the interests of all. I must be honest, ",UNGD
USA,2013,though; we are far more likely to invest our energy ,UNGD
USA,2013,"in those countries that want to work with us, that ",UNGD
USA,2013,"invest in their people instead of in a corrupt few, and ",UNGD
USA,2013,that embrace a vision of society where everyone can ,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,"contribute — men and women, Shia or Sunni, Muslim, ",UNGD
USA,2013,"Christian or Jew. Because from Europe to Asia, from ",UNGD
USA,2013,"Africa to the Americas, nations that have persevered on ",UNGD
USA,2013,"a democratic path have emerged more prosperous, more ",UNGD
USA,2013,peaceful and more invested in upholding our common ,UNGD
USA,2013,security and our common humanity. And I believe that ,UNGD
USA,2013,the same will hold true for the Arab world.,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,That leads me to a final point. There will be ,UNGD
USA,2013,times when the breakdown of societies is so great and ,UNGD
USA,2013,"the violence against civilians so substantial, that the ",UNGD
USA,2013,international community will be called upon to act. ,UNGD
USA,2013,That will require new thinking and some very tough ,UNGD
USA,2013,choices. While the United Nations was designed to ,UNGD
USA,2013,"prevent wars between States, increasingly we face ",UNGD
USA,2013,the challenge of preventing slaughter within States. ,UNGD
USA,2013,And those challenges will grow more pronounced ,UNGD
USA,2013,as we are confronted with States that are fragile or ,UNGD
USA,2013,failing — places where horrendous violence can put ,UNGD
USA,2013,"innocent men, women and children at risk with no hope ",UNGD
USA,2013,of protection from their national institutions.,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,I have made it clear that even when America’s core ,UNGD
USA,2013,"interests are not directly threatened, we stand ready to ",UNGD
USA,2013,do our part to prevent mass atrocities and protect basic ,UNGD
USA,2013,human rights. But we cannot and should not bear that ,UNGD
USA,2013,"burden alone. In Mali, we supported both the French ",UNGD
USA,2013,intervention that successfully pushed back Al-Qaida ,UNGD
USA,2013,and the African forces who are keeping the peace. In ,UNGD
USA,2013,"East Africa, we are working with partners to bring the ",UNGD
USA,2013,"Lord’s Resistance Army to an end. And in Libya, when ",UNGD
USA,2013,the Security Council provided a mandate to protect ,UNGD
USA,2013,"civilians, America joined a coalition that took action. ",UNGD
USA,2013,"Because of what we did there, countless lives were ",UNGD
USA,2013,saved and a tyrant could not kill his way back to power.,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,I know that some now criticize the action in ,UNGD
USA,2013,Libya as an object lesson. They point to the problems ,UNGD
USA,2013,that the country now confronts — a democratically ,UNGD
USA,2013,elected Government struggling to provide security; ,UNGD
USA,2013,"armed groups, in some places extremists, ruling parts ",UNGD
USA,2013,of a fractured land — and these critics argue that any ,UNGD
USA,2013,intervention to protect civilians is doomed to fail. Look ,UNGD
USA,2013,at Libya. No one is more mindful of those problems ,UNGD
USA,2013,"than I am, for they resulted in the death of four ",UNGD
USA,2013,outstanding United States citizens who were committed ,UNGD
USA,2013,"to the Libyan people, including Ambassador Chris ",UNGD
USA,2013,Stevens — a man whose courageous efforts helped save ,UNGD
USA,2013,the city of Benghazi. But does anyone truly believe that ,UNGD
USA,2013,the situation in Libya would be better if Al-Qadhafi had ,UNGD
USA,2013,"been allowed to kill, imprison or brutalize his people ",UNGD
USA,2013,into submission? It is far more likely that without ,UNGD
USA,2013,"international action, Libya would now be engulfed in ",UNGD
USA,2013,civil war and bloodshed.,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,We live in a world of imperfect choices. Different ,UNGD
USA,2013,nations will not agree on the need for action in every ,UNGD
USA,2013,"instance, and the principle of sovereignty is at the centre ",UNGD
USA,2013,of our international order. But sovereignty cannot be ,UNGD
USA,2013,a shield for tyrants to commit wanton murder or an ,UNGD
USA,2013,excuse for the international community to turn a blind ,UNGD
USA,2013,eye. While we need to be modest in our belief that we ,UNGD
USA,2013,"can remedy every evil, and while we need to be mindful ",UNGD
USA,2013,"that the world is full of unintended consequences, ",UNGD
USA,2013,should we really accept the notion that the world is ,UNGD
USA,2013,powerless in the face of a Rwanda or a Srebrenica? If ,UNGD
USA,2013,"that is the world that people want to live in, they should ",UNGD
USA,2013,say so and reckon with the cold logic of mass graves.,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,I believe that we can embrace a different future. If ,UNGD
USA,2013,"we do not want to choose between inaction and war, we ",UNGD
USA,2013,must get better — all of us — at the policies that prevent ,UNGD
USA,2013,the breakdown of basic order through respect for the ,UNGD
USA,2013,"responsibilities of nations and the rights of individuals, ",UNGD
USA,2013,through meaningful sanctions for those who break ,UNGD
USA,2013,"the rules, through dogged diplomacy that resolves the ",UNGD
USA,2013,"root causes of conflict and not merely its aftermath, ",UNGD
USA,2013,and through development assistance that brings hope ,UNGD
USA,2013,"to the marginalized. And yes sometimes, all this will ",UNGD
USA,2013,not be enough and there will be moments when the ,UNGD
USA,2013,international community will need to acknowledge that ,UNGD
USA,2013,the multilateral use of military force may be required to ,UNGD
USA,2013,prevent the very worst from occurring. ,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,"Ultimately, that is the international community ",UNGD
USA,2013,that America seeks — one where nations do not covet ,UNGD
USA,2013,"the land or resources of other nations, but one in which ",UNGD
USA,2013,we carry out the founding purpose of this institution ,UNGD
USA,2013,and where we all take responsibility; a world in which ,UNGD
USA,2013,the rules established out of the horrors of war can help ,UNGD
USA,2013,us resolve conflicts peacefully and prevent the kind of ,UNGD
USA,2013,wars that our forefathers fought; a world where human ,UNGD
USA,2013,"beings can live with dignity and meet their basic needs, ",UNGD
USA,2013,"whether they live in New York or Nairobi, in Peshawar ",UNGD
USA,2013,or Damascus.,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,These are extraordinary times with extraordinary ,UNGD
USA,2013,"opportunities. Thanks to human progress, a child ",UNGD
USA,2013,born anywhere on Earth today can do things that ,UNGD
USA,2013,60 years ago would have been out of reach for the mass ,UNGD
USA,2013,"of humankind. I saw this in Africa, where nations ",UNGD
USA,2013,moving beyond conflict are now poised to take off. ,UNGD
USA,2013,America is with them: partnering to feed the hungry ,UNGD
USA,2013,and to care for the sick and to bring power to places ,UNGD
USA,2013,"off the grid. I see it across the Pacific region, where ",UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,hundreds of millions have been lifted out of poverty in ,UNGD
USA,2013,a single generation. I see it in the faces of young people ,UNGD
USA,2013,everywhere who can access the entire world with the ,UNGD
USA,2013,click of a button and who are eager to join the cause of ,UNGD
USA,2013,"eradicating extreme poverty, combating climate change, ",UNGD
USA,2013,"starting businesses, expanding freedom, and leaving ",UNGD
USA,2013,behind the old ideological battles of the past. That is ,UNGD
USA,2013,"what is happening in Asia and Africa, it is happening ",UNGD
USA,2013,in Europe and the Americas. That is the future that the ,UNGD
USA,2013,people of the Middle East and North Africa deserve as ,UNGD
USA,2013,"well, one where they can focus on opportunity, instead ",UNGD
USA,2013,of on whether they will be killed or repressed because ,UNGD
USA,2013,of who they are or what they believe. ,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,"Time and again, nations and people have shown ",UNGD
USA,2013,"a capacity to change, to live up to humanity’s highest ",UNGD
USA,2013,"ideals, to choose a better history. Last month, I stood ",UNGD
USA,2013,where 50 years ago Martin Luther King Jr. told America ,UNGD
USA,2013,"about his dream, at a time when many people of my ",UNGD
USA,2013,"race could not even vote for President. Earlier this year, ",UNGD
USA,2013,I stood in the small cell where Nelson Mandela endured ,UNGD
USA,2013,"for decades, cut off from his own people and the world. ",UNGD
USA,2013,Who are we to believe that today’s challenges cannot be ,UNGD
USA,2013,"overcome, when we have seen what changes the human ",UNGD
USA,2013,spirit can bring? Who in this Hall can argue that the ,UNGD
USA,2013,"future belongs to those who seek to repress that spirit, ",UNGD
USA,2013,rather than to those who seek to liberate it? ,UNGD
USA,2013,,UNGD
USA,2013,I know what side of history I want the United States ,UNGD
USA,2013,of America to be on. We are ready to meet tomorrow’s ,UNGD
USA,2013,"challenges with you, firm in the belief that all men ",UNGD
USA,2013,"and women are in fact created equal, each individual ",UNGD
USA,2013,possessed with a dignity and inalienable rights that ,UNGD
USA,2013,cannot be denied. That is why we look to the future ,UNGD
USA,2013,"not with fear, but with hope. That is why we remain ",UNGD
USA,2013,convinced that this community of nations can deliver ,UNGD
USA,2013,"a more peaceful, prosperous, and just world to the next ",UNGD
USA,2013,generation. ,UNGD
USA,2014,We come together at a ,UNGD
USA,2014,"crossroads between war and peace, between disorder ",UNGD
USA,2014,"and integration, between fear and hope. Around the ",UNGD
USA,2014,"globe, there are signposts of progress. The shadow of ",UNGD
USA,2014,the Second World War that existed at the founding of ,UNGD
USA,2014,"this institution has been lifted, and the prospect of war ",UNGD
USA,2014,between major Powers reduced. The ranks of Member ,UNGD
USA,2014,"States have more than tripled, and more people live ",UNGD
USA,2014,under Governments that they elected. Hundreds of ,UNGD
USA,2014,millions of human beings have been freed from the ,UNGD
USA,2014,"prison of poverty, with the proportion of those living ",UNGD
USA,2014,in extreme poverty cut in half. And the world economy ,UNGD
USA,2014,continues to strengthen after the worst financial crisis ,UNGD
USA,2014,of our lives.,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,"Today, whether you live in downtown Manhattan or ",UNGD
USA,2014,in my grandmother’s village more than 200 miles from ,UNGD
USA,2014,"Nairobi, you can hold in your hand more information ",UNGD
USA,2014,"than the world’s greatest libraries. Together, we have ",UNGD
USA,2014,learned how to cure disease and harness the power ,UNGD
USA,2014,of the wind and the sun. The very existence of this ,UNGD
USA,2014,"Organization is a unique achievement, with the people ",UNGD
USA,2014,of the world committing to resolve their differences ,UNGD
USA,2014,peacefully and to solve their problems together. I often ,UNGD
USA,2014,"tell young people in the United States that, despite ",UNGD
USA,2014,"the headlines, this is the best time in human history ",UNGD
USA,2014,"to be born, for you are more likely than ever before to ",UNGD
USA,2014,"be literate, to be healthy and to be free to pursue your ",UNGD
USA,2014,dreams.,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,And yet there is a pervasive unease in our world — a ,UNGD
USA,2014,sense that the very forces that have brought us together ,UNGD
USA,2014,have created new dangers and made it difficult for any ,UNGD
USA,2014,single nation to insulate itself from global forces. As we ,UNGD
USA,2014,"gather here, an outbreak of Ebola overwhelms public ",UNGD
USA,2014,health systems in West Africa and threatens to move ,UNGD
USA,2014,rapidly across borders. Russian aggression in Europe ,UNGD
USA,2014,recalls the days when large nations trampled small ,UNGD
USA,2014,ones in pursuit of territorial ambitions. The brutality ,UNGD
USA,2014,of terrorists in Syria and Iraq forces us to look into the ,UNGD
USA,2014,heart of darkness.,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,Each of those problems demands urgent attention. ,UNGD
USA,2014,But they are also symptoms of a broader problem: ,UNGD
USA,2014,the failure of our international system to keep pace ,UNGD
USA,2014,"with an interconnected world. We, collectively, have ",UNGD
USA,2014,not invested adequately in the public health capacity ,UNGD
USA,2014,"of developing countries. Too often, we have failed ",UNGD
USA,2014,to enforce international norms when it has been ,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,inconvenient to do so. And we have not confronted ,UNGD
USA,2014,"forcefully enough the intolerance, sectarianism and ",UNGD
USA,2014,hopelessness that feeds violent extremism in too many ,UNGD
USA,2014,parts of the globe.,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,"Fellow representatives, we come together as ",UNGD
USA,2014,United Nations with a choice to make. We can renew ,UNGD
USA,2014,the international system that has enabled so much ,UNGD
USA,2014,"progress, or we can allow ourselves to be pulled back ",UNGD
USA,2014,by an undertow of instability. We can reaffirm our ,UNGD
USA,2014,"collective responsibility to confront global problems, or ",UNGD
USA,2014,be swamped by more and more outbreaks of instability. ,UNGD
USA,2014,"And for America, the choice is clear — we choose hope ",UNGD
USA,2014,over fear. We see the future not as something out of our ,UNGD
USA,2014,"control, but as something we can shape for the better ",UNGD
USA,2014,through concerted and collective effort. We reject ,UNGD
USA,2014,fatalism or cynicism when it comes to human affairs. ,UNGD
USA,2014,"We choose to work for the world as it should be, as our ",UNGD
USA,2014,children deserve it to be.,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,There is much that must be done to meet the test ,UNGD
USA,2014,of this moment. But today I would like to focus on ,UNGD
USA,2014,two defining questions at the root of so many of our ,UNGD
USA,2014,challenges. Will the nations represented here today ,UNGD
USA,2014,be able to renew the purpose of the United Nations ,UNGD
USA,2014,"founding, and will we come together to reject the cancer ",UNGD
USA,2014,of violent extremism?,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,"First, all of us — big nations and small — must meet ",UNGD
USA,2014,our responsibility to observe and enforce international ,UNGD
USA,2014,norms. We are here because others realized that we ,UNGD
USA,2014,gain more from cooperation than from conquest. One ,UNGD
USA,2014,"hundred years ago, a World War claimed the lives of ",UNGD
USA,2014,"many millions, proving that with the terrible power of ",UNGD
USA,2014,"modern weaponry, the cause of empire ultimately leads ",UNGD
USA,2014,to the graveyard. It would then take another World War ,UNGD
USA,2014,"to roll back the forces of fascism, the notions of racial ",UNGD
USA,2014,"supremacy, and form the United Nations to ensure that ",UNGD
USA,2014,no nation can subjugate its neighbours and claim their ,UNGD
USA,2014,territory.,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,"Recently, Russia’s actions in Ukraine have ",UNGD
USA,2014,challenged that post-war order. Here are the facts. After ,UNGD
USA,2014,the people of Ukraine mobilized popular protests and ,UNGD
USA,2014,"calls for reform, their corrupt President fled. Against ",UNGD
USA,2014,"the will of the Government in Kyiv, Crimea was annexed ",UNGD
USA,2014,"by Russia. Russia poured arms into eastern Ukraine, ",UNGD
USA,2014,fuelling violent separatists and a conflict that has killed ,UNGD
USA,2014,thousands. When a civilian airliner was shot down from ,UNGD
USA,2014,"areas that those proxy forces controlled, those forces ",UNGD
USA,2014,refused to allow access to the crash site for days. When ,UNGD
USA,2014,"Ukraine started to reassert control over its territory, ",UNGD
USA,2014,Russia gave up the pretence of merely supporting the ,UNGD
USA,2014,separatists and moved troops across the border.,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,That reflects a vision of a world in which might ,UNGD
USA,2014,makes right; a world in which one nation’s borders ,UNGD
USA,2014,can be redrawn by another and civilized people are ,UNGD
USA,2014,not allowed to recover the remains of their loved ones ,UNGD
USA,2014,because of the truth that might be revealed.,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,America stands for something different. We believe ,UNGD
USA,2014,"that right makes might, that bigger nations should not ",UNGD
USA,2014,be able to bully smaller ones and that people should ,UNGD
USA,2014,be able to choose their own future. Those are simple ,UNGD
USA,2014,"truths, but they must be defended. America and our ",UNGD
USA,2014,allies will support the people of Ukraine as they develop ,UNGD
USA,2014,their democracy and economy. We will reinforce our ,UNGD
USA,2014,NATO allies and uphold our commitment to collective ,UNGD
USA,2014,self-defence. We will impose a cost on Russia for its ,UNGD
USA,2014,"aggression, and we will counter falsehoods with the ",UNGD
USA,2014,truth. And we call upon others to join us on the right ,UNGD
USA,2014,"side of history, for while small gains can be won at the ",UNGD
USA,2014,"barrel of a gun, they will ultimately be turned back if ",UNGD
USA,2014,enough voices support the freedom of nations and the ,UNGD
USA,2014,right of peoples to make their own decisions.,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,"Moreover, a different path is available — the path of ",UNGD
USA,2014,"diplomacy and peace, and the ideals that this institution ",UNGD
USA,2014,is designed to uphold. The recent ceasefire agreement in ,UNGD
USA,2014,Ukraine offers an opening to achieve those objectives. ,UNGD
USA,2014,If Russia takes that path — a path that for stretches of ,UNGD
USA,2014,the post-Cold War period resulted in prosperity for the ,UNGD
USA,2014,Russian people — then we will lift our sanctions and ,UNGD
USA,2014,welcome Russia’s role in addressing common challenges. ,UNGD
USA,2014,"That is, after all, what the United States and Russia ",UNGD
USA,2014,have been able to do in past years — from reducing our ,UNGD
USA,2014,nuclear stockpiles to meeting our obligations under the ,UNGD
USA,2014,Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and to cooperating to ,UNGD
USA,2014,remove and destroy Syria’s declared chemical weapons. ,UNGD
USA,2014,That is the kind of cooperation we are prepared to ,UNGD
USA,2014,"pursue again, if Russia changes course.",UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,That speaks to a central question of our global ,UNGD
USA,2014,age — will we solve our problems together in a spirit of ,UNGD
USA,2014,"mutual interest and mutual respect, or will we descend ",UNGD
USA,2014,into the destructive rivalries of the past? When nations ,UNGD
USA,2014,"find common ground — not simply based on power, but ",UNGD
USA,2014,on principle — then we can make enormous progress. ,UNGD
USA,2014,And I stand before the Assembly today committed to ,UNGD
USA,2014,investing American strength and to working with all ,UNGD
USA,2014,nations to address the problems we face in the twenty-,UNGD
USA,2014,first century.,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,"As we speak, America is deploying our doctors and ",UNGD
USA,2014,"scientists, supported by our military, to help contain ",UNGD
USA,2014,the outbreak of Ebola and pursue new treatments. But ,UNGD
USA,2014,we need a broader effort to stop a disease that could ,UNGD
USA,2014,"kill hundreds of thousands, inflict horrific suffering, ",UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,destabilize economies and move rapidly across borders. ,UNGD
USA,2014,"It is easy to see that problem as a distant problem, ",UNGD
USA,2014,until it is not. And that is why we will continue to ,UNGD
USA,2014,mobilize other countries to join us in making concrete ,UNGD
USA,2014,"commitments, significant commitments to fight the ",UNGD
USA,2014,outbreak and enhance our system of global health ,UNGD
USA,2014,security for the long term.,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,America is pursuing a diplomatic resolution to the ,UNGD
USA,2014,"Iranian nuclear issue, as part of our commitment to stop ",UNGD
USA,2014,the spread of nuclear weapons and pursue the peace ,UNGD
USA,2014,and security of a world without them. But that can take ,UNGD
USA,2014,place only if Iran seizes this historic opportunity. My ,UNGD
USA,2014,message to Iran’s leaders and people has been simple ,UNGD
USA,2014,and consistent: do not let this opportunity pass. We can ,UNGD
USA,2014,reach a solution that meets Iran’s energy needs while ,UNGD
USA,2014,assuring the world that Iran’s nuclear programme is ,UNGD
USA,2014,peaceful.,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,America is and will continue to be a Pacific ,UNGD
USA,2014,"Power, promoting peace, stability, and the free flow ",UNGD
USA,2014,of commerce among nations. But we will insist that ,UNGD
USA,2014,all nations abide by the rules of the road and resolve ,UNGD
USA,2014,"their territorial disputes peacefully, consistent with ",UNGD
USA,2014,international law. That is how the Asia-Pacific region ,UNGD
USA,2014,has grown. And that is the only way to protect the ,UNGD
USA,2014,progress going forward.,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,America is committed to a development agenda that ,UNGD
USA,2014,eradicates extreme poverty by 2030. We will do our part ,UNGD
USA,2014,"to help people feed themselves, power their economies ",UNGD
USA,2014,"and care for their sick. If the world acts together, we ",UNGD
USA,2014,can make sure that all of our children enjoy lives of ,UNGD
USA,2014,opportunity and dignity.,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,America is pursuing ambitious reductions in ,UNGD
USA,2014,"its carbon emissions, and we have increased our ",UNGD
USA,2014,investments in clean energy. We will do our part and ,UNGD
USA,2014,help developing nations do theirs. But the science tells ,UNGD
USA,2014,us that we can succeed in combating climate change ,UNGD
USA,2014,"only if we are joined in that effort by every other nation, ",UNGD
USA,2014,by every major Power. That is how we can protect the ,UNGD
USA,2014,planet for our children and our grandchildren.,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,"In other words, on issue after issue, we cannot rely ",UNGD
USA,2014,on a rule book written for a different century. If we lift ,UNGD
USA,2014,"our eyes beyond our borders, if we think globally and ",UNGD
USA,2014,"if we act cooperatively, we can shape the course of this ",UNGD
USA,2014,century as our predecessors shaped the post-World War ,UNGD
USA,2014,Two age.,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,"But as we look to the future, one issue risks starting ",UNGD
USA,2014,a cycle of conflict that could derail so much progress. ,UNGD
USA,2014,"That is the cancer of violent extremism, which has ",UNGD
USA,2014,"ravaged so many parts of the Muslim world. Of course, ",UNGD
USA,2014,"terrorism is not new. Speaking before the Assembly, ",UNGD
USA,2014,President Kennedy put it well:,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,“Terror is not a new weapon. Throughout ,UNGD
USA,2014,history it has been used by those who could not ,UNGD
USA,2014,prevail either by persuasion or by example.” ,UNGD
USA,2014,"(A/PV.1013, para. 96)",UNGD
USA,2014,"In the twentieth century, terror was used by all ",UNGD
USA,2014,manner of groups who failed to come to power through ,UNGD
USA,2014,"public support. But in this century, we have faced a ",UNGD
USA,2014,more lethal and ideological brand of terrorists who have ,UNGD
USA,2014,perverted one of the world’s great religions. With access ,UNGD
USA,2014,"to technology that allows small groups to do great harm, ",UNGD
USA,2014,they have embraced a nightmarish vision that would ,UNGD
USA,2014,divide the world into adherents and infidels — killing ,UNGD
USA,2014,as many innocent civilians as possible and employing ,UNGD
USA,2014,the most brutal methods to intimidate people within ,UNGD
USA,2014,their communities.,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,I have made it clear that America will not base its ,UNGD
USA,2014,"entire foreign policy on reacting to terrorism. Instead, ",UNGD
USA,2014,we have waged a focused campaign against Al-Qaida ,UNGD
USA,2014,and its associated forces — taking out their leaders ,UNGD
USA,2014,and denying them the safe havens they rely on. At the ,UNGD
USA,2014,"same time, we have reaffirmed again and again that the ",UNGD
USA,2014,United States is not and never will be at war with Islam. ,UNGD
USA,2014,Islam teaches peace. Muslims the world over aspire to ,UNGD
USA,2014,live with dignity and a sense of justice. And when it ,UNGD
USA,2014,"comes to America and Islam, there is no us and them, ",UNGD
USA,2014,"there is only us, because millions of Muslim Americans ",UNGD
USA,2014,are part of the fabric of our country.,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,So we reject any suggestion of a clash of ,UNGD
USA,2014,civilizations. Belief in permanent religious war is the ,UNGD
USA,2014,misguided refuge of extremists who cannot build or ,UNGD
USA,2014,create anything and therefore peddle only fanaticism ,UNGD
USA,2014,and hate. And it is no exaggeration to say that the future ,UNGD
USA,2014,of humankind depends on our uniting against those ,UNGD
USA,2014,who would divide us along the fault lines of tribe or ,UNGD
USA,2014,"sect, race or religion.",UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,"But this is not simply a matter of words. Collectively, ",UNGD
USA,2014,we must take concrete steps to address the danger posed ,UNGD
USA,2014,by religiously motivated fanatics and the trends that ,UNGD
USA,2014,"fuel their recruitment. Moreover, the campaign against ",UNGD
USA,2014,extremism goes beyond a narrow security challenge. ,UNGD
USA,2014,For while we have worked methodically to degrade ,UNGD
USA,2014,Al-Qaida at its core and have supported a transition to ,UNGD
USA,2014,"a sovereign Afghan Government, extremist ideology ",UNGD
USA,2014,"has shifted to other places, particularly in the Middle ",UNGD
USA,2014,"East and North Africa, where a quarter of the young ",UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,"people have no job, where food and water could grow ",UNGD
USA,2014,"scarce, and where corruption is rampant and sectarian ",UNGD
USA,2014,conflicts have become increasingly hard to contain.,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,"As an international community, we must meet this ",UNGD
USA,2014,"challenge with a focus on four areas. First, the terrorist ",UNGD
USA,2014,group known as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant ,UNGD
USA,2014,(ISIL) must be degraded and ultimately destroyed. It ,UNGD
USA,2014,has terrorized all those whom it has come across in Iraq ,UNGD
USA,2014,"and Syria. Mothers, sisters and daughters have been ",UNGD
USA,2014,subjected to rape as a weapon of war. Innocent children ,UNGD
USA,2014,have been gunned down. Bodies have been dumped into ,UNGD
USA,2014,mass graves. Religious minorities have been starved to ,UNGD
USA,2014,"death. In the most horrific crimes imaginable, innocent ",UNGD
USA,2014,"human beings have been beheaded, with videos of ",UNGD
USA,2014,the atrocity distributed to shock the conscience of the ,UNGD
USA,2014,world.,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,No god condones such terror. No grievance ,UNGD
USA,2014,justifies such actions. There can be no reasoning or ,UNGD
USA,2014,negotiation with that brand of evil. The only language ,UNGD
USA,2014,understood by killers of that kind is the language of ,UNGD
USA,2014,force. So the United States of America will work with ,UNGD
USA,2014,a broad coalition to dismantle that network of death. In ,UNGD
USA,2014,"this effort, we do not act alone, nor do we intend to send ",UNGD
USA,2014,"United States troops to occupy foreign lands. Instead, ",UNGD
USA,2014,we will support Iraqis and Syrians fighting to reclaim ,UNGD
USA,2014,their communities. We will use our military might to ,UNGD
USA,2014,roll back ISIL in a campaign of air strikes. We will train ,UNGD
USA,2014,and equip forces fighting those terrorists on the ground. ,UNGD
USA,2014,We will work to cut off their financing and stop the flow ,UNGD
USA,2014,of fighters into and out of the region. And more than ,UNGD
USA,2014,40 nations have already offered to join the coalition. ,UNGD
USA,2014,"Today, I ask the world to join in this effort. Those who ",UNGD
USA,2014,have joined ISIL should leave the battlefield while they ,UNGD
USA,2014,can. Those who continue to fight for a hateful cause ,UNGD
USA,2014,will find that they are increasingly alone. For we will ,UNGD
USA,2014,"not succumb to threats, and we will demonstrate that ",UNGD
USA,2014,"the future belongs to those who build, not to those who ",UNGD
USA,2014,"destroy. So that is an immediate challenge, the first one ",UNGD
USA,2014,we must meet.,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,The second challenge is that it is time for the ,UNGD
USA,2014,"world, especially Muslim communities, to explicitly, ",UNGD
USA,2014,forcefully and consistently reject the ideology of ,UNGD
USA,2014,organizations such as Al-Qaida and ISIL. It is one of ,UNGD
USA,2014,the tasks of all great religions to accommodate devout ,UNGD
USA,2014,"faith with a modern, multicultural world. No children ",UNGD
USA,2014,"are born hating, and no children anywhere should be ",UNGD
USA,2014,educated to hate other people. There should be no ,UNGD
USA,2014,further tolerance of so-called clerics who call on people ,UNGD
USA,2014,to harm innocents because they are Jewish or Christian ,UNGD
USA,2014,or Muslim. It is time for a new compact among the ,UNGD
USA,2014,civilized peoples of this world to eradicate war at its ,UNGD
USA,2014,"most fundamental source, and that is the corruption of ",UNGD
USA,2014,young minds by violent ideology.,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,That means cutting off the funding that fuels such ,UNGD
USA,2014,hatred. It is time to end the hypocrisy of those who ,UNGD
USA,2014,accumulate wealth through the global economy and ,UNGD
USA,2014,then siphon funds to those who teach children to tear ,UNGD
USA,2014,it down. That means contesting the space that terrorists ,UNGD
USA,2014,"occupy, including the Internet and social media. Their ",UNGD
USA,2014,propaganda has coerced young people to travel abroad ,UNGD
USA,2014,to fight their wars and has turned students — young ,UNGD
USA,2014,people full of potential — into suicide bombers. We ,UNGD
USA,2014,must offer an alternative vision. That means bringing ,UNGD
USA,2014,people of different faiths together. All religions have ,UNGD
USA,2014,"been attacked by extremists from within at some point, ",UNGD
USA,2014,and all people of faith have a responsibility to lift up the ,UNGD
USA,2014,value at the heart of all great religions. Do unto your ,UNGD
USA,2014,neighbour as you would do — as you would have others ,UNGD
USA,2014,do — unto yourself.,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,The ideology of ISIL or Al-Qaida or Boko ,UNGD
USA,2014,Haram will wilt and die if it is consistently exposed ,UNGD
USA,2014,and confronted and refuted in the light of day. Look ,UNGD
USA,2014,at the new Forum for Promoting Peace in Muslim ,UNGD
USA,2014,"Societies, whose purpose Sheikh Abdallah Bin Bayyah ",UNGD
USA,2014,"has described as “We must declare war on war, so ",UNGD
USA,2014,the outcome will be peace upon peace”. Look at the ,UNGD
USA,2014,young British Muslims who have responded to terrorist ,UNGD
USA,2014,"propaganda by starting the #notinmyname campaign, ",UNGD
USA,2014,declaring that ISIL is hiding behind a false Islam. Look ,UNGD
USA,2014,at the Christian and Muslim leaders who came together ,UNGD
USA,2014,in the Central African Republic to reject violence; listen ,UNGD
USA,2014,"to the imam there who said that, while politics may try ",UNGD
USA,2014,"to divide the religious in that country, religion should ",UNGD
USA,2014,"not be a cause of hate, war, or strife.",UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,"Later today, the Security Council will adopt a ",UNGD
USA,2014,resolution that underscores the responsibility of States ,UNGD
USA,2014,to counter violent extremism. But resolutions must ,UNGD
USA,2014,"be followed by tangible commitments, so that we are ",UNGD
USA,2014,"accountable when we fall short. Next year, we should ",UNGD
USA,2014,all be prepared to announce the concrete steps that ,UNGD
USA,2014,we have taken to counter extremist ideologies in our ,UNGD
USA,2014,"own countries — by getting intolerance out of schools, ",UNGD
USA,2014,stopping radicalization before it spreads and promoting ,UNGD
USA,2014,institutions and programmes that build new bridges of ,UNGD
USA,2014,understanding.,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,"Thirdly, we must address the cycle of conflict, ",UNGD
USA,2014,"especially sectarian conflict, that creates the conditions ",UNGD
USA,2014,that terrorists prey upon. There is nothing new about ,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,wars within religions. Christianity endured centuries of ,UNGD
USA,2014,vicious sectarian conflict. Today it is violence within ,UNGD
USA,2014,Muslim communities that has become the source ,UNGD
USA,2014,of so much human misery. It is time to acknowledge ,UNGD
USA,2014,the destruction wrought by proxy wars and terror ,UNGD
USA,2014,campaigns between Sunni and Shia across the Middle ,UNGD
USA,2014,"East. And it is time that political, civic and religious ",UNGD
USA,2014,leaders rejected sectarian strife. So let us be clear. This ,UNGD
USA,2014,is a fight that no one is winning. A brutal civil war in ,UNGD
USA,2014,"Syria has already killed nearly 200,000 people and has ",UNGD
USA,2014,displaced millions. Iraq has come perilously close to ,UNGD
USA,2014,plunging back into the abyss. The conflict has created ,UNGD
USA,2014,"a fertile recruiting ground for terrorists, who inevitably ",UNGD
USA,2014,export such violence.,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,The good news is that we also see signs that the tide ,UNGD
USA,2014,"can be reversed. We have a new, inclusive Government ",UNGD
USA,2014,in Baghdad and a new Iraqi Prime Minister welcomed ,UNGD
USA,2014,by his neighbours; we see Lebanese factions that reject ,UNGD
USA,2014,those who try to provoke war. Such steps must be followed ,UNGD
USA,2014,by a broader truce. Nowhere is that more necessary ,UNGD
USA,2014,"than in Syria. Together with our partners, America is ",UNGD
USA,2014,training and equipping the Syrian opposition to be a ,UNGD
USA,2014,counterweight to the terrorists of ISIL and the brutality ,UNGD
USA,2014,of the Al-Assad regime. But the only lasting solution ,UNGD
USA,2014,to Syria’s civil war is political — an inclusive political ,UNGD
USA,2014,transition that responds to the legitimate aspirations of ,UNGD
USA,2014,"all Syrian citizens, regardless of ethnicity, regardless ",UNGD
USA,2014,of creed.,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,Cynics may argue that such an outcome can never ,UNGD
USA,2014,come to pass. But there is no other way for the madness ,UNGD
USA,2014,"in Syria to end, whether one year from now or 10. And it ",UNGD
USA,2014,points to the fact that it is time for a broader negotiation ,UNGD
USA,2014,"in the region, in which major Powers address their ",UNGD
USA,2014,"differences directly, honestly and peacefully across ",UNGD
USA,2014,"the table from one another, rather than through gun-",UNGD
USA,2014,wielding proxies. I can promise the international ,UNGD
USA,2014,community that America will remain engaged in the ,UNGD
USA,2014,"region, and we are prepared to engage in that effort.",UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,My fourth and final point is a simple one. The ,UNGD
USA,2014,countries of the Arab and Muslim world must focus on ,UNGD
USA,2014,"the extraordinary potential of their people, especially ",UNGD
USA,2014,the youth. And here I would like to speak directly to ,UNGD
USA,2014,young people across the Muslim world. You come ,UNGD
USA,2014,"from a great tradition that stands for education, not ",UNGD
USA,2014,"ignorance; innovation, not destruction; the dignity of ",UNGD
USA,2014,"life, not murder. Those who call you away from that ",UNGD
USA,2014,"path are betraying that tradition, not defending it. You ",UNGD
USA,2014,have demonstrated that when young people have the ,UNGD
USA,2014,"tools to succeed — good schools, education in math ",UNGD
USA,2014,"and science, an economy that nurtures creativity and ",UNGD
USA,2014,"entrepreneurship — then societies will flourish. So, ",UNGD
USA,2014,America will partner with those who promote that ,UNGD
USA,2014,vision.,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,Where women are full participants in a country’s ,UNGD
USA,2014,"politics or economy, societies are more likely to ",UNGD
USA,2014,succeed. And that is why we support the participation of ,UNGD
USA,2014,"women in parliaments and peace processes, schools and ",UNGD
USA,2014,the economy. If young people live in places where the ,UNGD
USA,2014,only option is between the dictates of a State or the lure ,UNGD
USA,2014,"of an extremist underground, then no counterterrorism ",UNGD
USA,2014,strategy can succeed. But where a genuine civil society ,UNGD
USA,2014,is allowed to flourish — where people can express their ,UNGD
USA,2014,views and organize peacefully for a better life — then ,UNGD
USA,2014,you dramatically expand the alternatives to terror.,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,And such positive change need not come at the ,UNGD
USA,2014,"expense of tradition and faith. We see that in Iraq, where ",UNGD
USA,2014,a young man started a library for his peers. “We link ,UNGD
USA,2014,"Iraq’s heritage to their hearts”, he said, and “give them ",UNGD
USA,2014,"a reason to stay”. We see it in Tunisia, where secular ",UNGD
USA,2014,and Islamist parties worked together through a political ,UNGD
USA,2014,process to produce a new constitution. We see it in ,UNGD
USA,2014,"Senegal, where civil society thrives alongside a strong ",UNGD
USA,2014,"democratic Government. We see it in Malaysia, where ",UNGD
USA,2014,vibrant entrepreneurship is propelling a former colony ,UNGD
USA,2014,into the ranks of advanced economies. And we see it in ,UNGD
USA,2014,"Indonesia, where what began as a violent transition has ",UNGD
USA,2014,evolved into a genuine democracy.,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,Ultimately the task of rejecting sectarianism and ,UNGD
USA,2014,"rejecting extremism is a generational one, and a task ",UNGD
USA,2014,for the people of the Middle East themselves. No ,UNGD
USA,2014,external power can bring about a transformation of ,UNGD
USA,2014,hearts and minds. But America will be a respectful ,UNGD
USA,2014,and constructive partner. We will neither tolerate ,UNGD
USA,2014,terrorist safe havens nor act as an occupying Power. ,UNGD
USA,2014,We will take action against threats to our security and ,UNGD
USA,2014,"our allies, while building an architecture of counter-",UNGD
USA,2014,terrorism cooperation. We will increase efforts to lift ,UNGD
USA,2014,up those who counter extremist ideologies and who ,UNGD
USA,2014,seek to resolve sectarian conflict. And we will expand ,UNGD
USA,2014,our programmes to support entrepreneurship and civil ,UNGD
USA,2014,"society, education and youth, because ultimately those ",UNGD
USA,2014,investments are the best antidote to violence.,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,We recognize as well that leadership will be ,UNGD
USA,2014,necessary to address the conflict between Palestinians ,UNGD
USA,2014,"and Israelis. As bleak as the landscape appears, America ",UNGD
USA,2014,will not give up on the pursuit of peace. Understand that ,UNGD
USA,2014,the situation in Iraq and Syria and Libya should cure ,UNGD
USA,2014,anybody of the illusion that the Arab-Israeli conflict ,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,is the main source of problems in the region. For far ,UNGD
USA,2014,too long that has been used as an excuse to distract ,UNGD
USA,2014,people from problems at home. The violence engulfing ,UNGD
USA,2014,the region today has made too many Israelis ready to ,UNGD
USA,2014,abandon the hard work of peace. And that is something ,UNGD
USA,2014,worthy of reflection within Israel. Because let us be ,UNGD
USA,2014,clear: the status quo in the West Bank and Gaza is not ,UNGD
USA,2014,sustainable. We cannot afford to turn away from that ,UNGD
USA,2014,"effort — not when rockets are fired at innocent Israelis, ",UNGD
USA,2014,or when the lives of so many Palestinian children are ,UNGD
USA,2014,"taken from us in Gaza. So long as I am President, we ",UNGD
USA,2014,"will stand up for the principle that Israelis, Palestinians, ",UNGD
USA,2014,the region and the world will be more just and more ,UNGD
USA,2014,"safe with two States living side by side, in peace and ",UNGD
USA,2014,security.,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,So this is what America is prepared to do: take ,UNGD
USA,2014,"action against immediate threats, while pursuing a ",UNGD
USA,2014,world in which the need for such action is diminished. ,UNGD
USA,2014,The United States will never shy away from defending ,UNGD
USA,2014,"our interests, but we will also not shy away from the ",UNGD
USA,2014,promise of this institution and its Universal Declaration ,UNGD
USA,2014,of Human Rights — the notion that peace is not merely ,UNGD
USA,2014,"the absence of war, but the presence of a better life.",UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,I realize that America’s critics will be quick to point ,UNGD
USA,2014,out that at times we too have failed to live up to our ,UNGD
USA,2014,ideals and that America has plenty of problems within ,UNGD
USA,2014,its own borders. That is true. In a summer marked by ,UNGD
USA,2014,"instability in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, I ",UNGD
USA,2014,know the world also took notice of the small American ,UNGD
USA,2014,"city of Ferguson, Missouri, where a young man was ",UNGD
USA,2014,"killed and a community was divided. So, yes, we have ",UNGD
USA,2014,"our own racial and ethnic tensions. And, like every ",UNGD
USA,2014,"country, we continually wrestle with how to reconcile ",UNGD
USA,2014,the vast changes wrought by globalization and greater ,UNGD
USA,2014,diversity with the traditions that we hold dear.,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,"But we welcome the scrutiny of the world, because ",UNGD
USA,2014,what you see in America is a country that has steadily ,UNGD
USA,2014,"worked to address our problems, to make our union ",UNGD
USA,2014,"more perfect, to bridge the divides that existed at the ",UNGD
USA,2014,founding of this nation. America is not the same as it ,UNGD
USA,2014,was 100 years ago or 50 years ago or even a decade ago. ,UNGD
USA,2014,We fight for our ideals and we are willing to criticize ,UNGD
USA,2014,ourselves when we fall short. We hold our leaders ,UNGD
USA,2014,accountable and insist on a free press and an independent ,UNGD
USA,2014,judiciary. We address our differences in the open space ,UNGD
USA,2014,"of democracy, with respect for the rule of law, with a ",UNGD
USA,2014,place for people of every race and every religion and ,UNGD
USA,2014,with an unyielding belief in the ability of individual ,UNGD
USA,2014,men and women to change their communities and their ,UNGD
USA,2014,circumstances and their countries for the better.,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,"After nearly six years as President, I believe that that ",UNGD
USA,2014,promise can help light the world. I have seen a longing ,UNGD
USA,2014,for positive change — for peace and for freedom and for ,UNGD
USA,2014,opportunity and for an end to bigotry — in the eyes of ,UNGD
USA,2014,young people whom I have met around the globe. They ,UNGD
USA,2014,remind me that no matter who you are or where you ,UNGD
USA,2014,come from or what you look like or what God you pray ,UNGD
USA,2014,"to or whom you love, there is something fundamental ",UNGD
USA,2014,that we all share. ,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,"Eleanor Roosevelt, a champion of the United ",UNGD
USA,2014,"Nations and America’s role in it, once asked, ",UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2014,"“Where, after all, do universal human rights ",UNGD
USA,2014,"begin? In small places, close to home — so close ",UNGD
USA,2014,and so small that they cannot be seen on any maps ,UNGD
USA,2014,of the world. Yet they are the world of the individual ,UNGD
USA,2014,person; the neighbourhood he lives in; the school or ,UNGD
USA,2014,"college he attends; the factory, farm or office where ",UNGD
USA,2014,he works.”,UNGD
USA,2014,"Around the world, young people are moving forward, ",UNGD
USA,2014,"hungry for a better world. Around the world, in small ",UNGD
USA,2014,"places, they are overcoming hatred and bigotry and ",UNGD
USA,2014,sectarianism. And they are learning to respect each ,UNGD
USA,2014,"other, despite differences.",UNGD
USA,2014,"The people of the world now look to us, here, to ",UNGD
USA,2014,be as decent and dignified and courageous as they are ,UNGD
USA,2014,"trying to be in their daily lives. And at this crossroads, ",UNGD
USA,2014,I can promise the Assembly that the United States ,UNGD
USA,2014,of America will not be distracted or deterred from ,UNGD
USA,2014,what must be done. We are heirs to a proud legacy of ,UNGD
USA,2014,"freedom, and we are prepared to do what is necessary ",UNGD
USA,2014,to secure that legacy for generations to come. I ask ,UNGD
USA,2014,"that the Assembly join us in this common mission, for ",UNGD
USA,2014,today’s children and tomorrow’s.,UNGD
USA,2014,,UNGD
USA,2015,"Seventy years after the founding of the United Nations it is worth reflecting on what the members of this body, working together, have helped to achieve. Out of the ashes of the Second World War, having witnessed the unthinkable power of the atomic age, the United States has worked with many nations in the Assembly to prevent a third world war — by forging alliances with old adversaries; by supporting the steady emergence of strong democracies accountable to their people and not to any foreign Power; and by building an international system that imposes a cost on those who choose conflict over cooperation, an order that recognizes the dignity and equal worth of all people.",UNGD
USA,2015,"That has been the work of seven decades. That is the ideal that this body has, at its best, pursued. Of course, there have been too many times when, collectively, we have fallen short of those ideals. Over the seven decades, terrible conflicts have claimed untold victims. But we have pressed forward, slowly, steadily, to make a system of international rules and norms that are better and stronger and more consistent.",UNGD
USA,2015,It is that international order that has underwritten unparalleled advances in human liberty and prosperity. It is that collective endeavour that has brought about diplomatic cooperation among the world’s major Powers and buttressed a global economy that has lifted more than a billion people from poverty. It is those international principles that have helped constrain bigger countries from imposing their will on smaller ones and have advanced the emergence of democracy and development and individual liberty on every continent.,UNGD
USA,2015,"That progress is real. It can be documented in lives saved, agreements forged, diseases conquered and mouths fed. And yet we come together today knowing that the march of human progress never travels in a straight line, that our work is far from complete and that dangerous currents risk pulling us back into a darker, more disordered world.",UNGD
USA,2015,"Today we are seeing the collapse of strongmen and fragile States breeding conflict and driving innocent men, women and children across borders on an epic scale. Brutal networks of terror have stepped into the vacuum. Technologies that empower individuals are now also exploited by those who spread disinformation, suppress dissent or radicalize our youth. Global capital flows have powered growth and investment, but they have also increased the risk of contagion, weakened the bargaining power of workers and accelerated inequality.",UNGD
USA,2015,"How should we respond to those trends? There are those who argue that the ideals enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations are unachievable or out of date, a legacy of a postwar era not suited to our own. In effect, they are arguing for a return to the rules that applied for most of human history and that predate this institution — the belief that power is a zero-sum game, that might makes right, that strong States must impose their will on weaker ones, that the rights of individuals do not matter and that in a time of rapid change, order must be imposed by force.",UNGD
USA,2015,"On that basis, we see some major Powers assert themselves in ways that contravene international law. We see an erosion of the democratic principles and human rights that are fundamental to this institution’s mission. Information is strictly controlled and the space for civil society restricted. We are told that such retrenchment is required to beat back disorder; that it is the only way to stamp out terrorism and prevent foreign meddling. In accordance with that logic, we should support tyrants like Bashar Al-Assad, who drops barrel bombs to massacre innocent children, because the alternative is surely worse.",UNGD
USA,2015,"This increasing scepticism of our international order can also be found in the most advanced democracies. We see greater polarization and more frequent gridlock, with movements on the far right, and sometimes the left, that insist on stopping the trade that binds our fates to other nations or calling for the building of walls to keep out immigrants. Most ominously, we see the fears of ordinary people being exploited through appeals to sectarianism, tribalism, racism or anti-Semitism; appeals to a glorious past before the body politic was infected by those who look different or worship God differently — a politics of us versus them.",UNGD
USA,2015,"The United States is not immune to this. Even as our economy is growing and our troops have largely returned from Iraq and Afghanistan, we see in our debates about America’s role in the world a notion of strength that is defined by opposition to old enemies, perceived adversaries — a rising China or resurgent Russia, a revolutionary Iran or an Islam that is incompatible with peace. We see arguments that the only strength that matters for the United States is bellicose words and shows of military force, and that cooperation and diplomacy will not work.",UNGD
USA,2015,"As President of the United States, I am mindful of the dangers that we face. They cross my desk every ",UNGD
USA,2015,"morning. I lead the strongest military that the world has ever known, and I will never hesitate to protect my country or our allies, unilaterally and by force where necessary. But I stand before the Assembly today believing in my core that we, the nations of the world, cannot return to the old ways of conflict and coercion. We cannot look backwards. We live in an integrated world, one in which we all have a stake in one another’s success.",UNGD
USA,2015,"We cannot turn back those forces of integration. No nation here in the Assembly can insulate itself from the threat of terrorism, the risk of financial contagion, the flow of migrants or the danger of a warming planet. The disorder we see is not driven solely by competition between nations or by any single ideology. If we cannot work together more effectively, we will all suffer the consequences.",UNGD
USA,2015,"That is true for the United States as well. No matter how powerful our military, how strong our economy, we understand the United States cannot solve the world’s problems alone. In Iraq, the United States learned the hard lesson that even with hundreds of thousands of brave, effective troops and trillions of dollars from our Treasury, it cannot by itself impose stability on a foreign land. Unless we work with other nations under the mantle of international norms, principles and law that offers legitimacy to our efforts, we will not succeed. And unless we work together to defeat the ideas that drive the various communities in a country like Iraq into conflict, any order that our militaries can impose will be temporary.",UNGD
USA,2015,"Just as force alone cannot impose order internationally, I believe in my core that repression cannot forge the social cohesion that nations need to succeed. The history of the last two decades proves that in today’s world, dictatorships are unstable. The strongmen of today become the spark of revolution tomorrow. You can jail your opponents, but you cannot imprison ideas. You can try to control access to information, but you cannot turn a lie into truth. It is not a conspiracy of United States-backed non-governmental organizations that exposes corruption and raises the expectations of people around the globe — it is technology, social media and the irreducible desire of people everywhere to make their own choices about how they are governed.",UNGD
USA,2015,"Indeed, I believe that in today’s world, the measure of strength is no longer defined by the control of territory. Lasting prosperity does not come solely from",UNGD
USA,2015,"the ability to access and extract raw materials. The strength of nations depends on the success of their people — their knowledge, innovation, imagination, creativity, drive and opportunity — and that, in turn, depends on individual rights, good governance and personal security. Both internal repression and foreign aggression are symptoms of a failure to provide that foundation.",UNGD
USA,2015,"Politics and solidarity that depend on demonizing others, that draw on religious sectarianism, narrow tribalism or jingoism, may at times look like strength in the moment, but over time their weakness will be exposed. And history tells us that the dark forces unleashed by this type of politics surely make all of us less secure. Our world has been there before. We gain nothing from going back.",UNGD
USA,2015,"Instead, I believe that we must go forward in pursuit of our ideals, not abandon them at this critical time. We must give expression to our best hopes, not our deepest fears. This institution was founded because men and women who came before us had the foresight to know that our nations are more secure when we uphold basic laws and norms and pursue a path of cooperation rather than conflict. And strong nations, above all, have a responsibility to uphold that international order.",UNGD
USA,2015,"Let me give a concrete example. After I took office, I made it clear that one of the principal achievements of the United Nations — the nuclear non-proliferation regime — was endangered by Iran’s violation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. On that basis, the Security Council tightened sanctions on the Iranian Government, and many nations joined us to enforce them. Together, we showed that laws and agreements mean something. But we also understood that the goal of sanctions was not simply to punish Iran. Our objective was to test whether Iran could change course, accept constraints and allow the world to verify that its nuclear programme would be peaceful. For two years, the United States and our partners, including Russia and China, stuck together in complex negotiations. The result is a lasting, comprehensive deal that prevents Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon while allowing it to access peaceful energy. If the deal is fully implemented, the prohibition on nuclear weapons is strengthened, a potential war is averted and our world is safer. That is the strength of the international system when it works the way it should.",UNGD
USA,2015,That same fidelity to international order guides our responses to other challenges around the world.,UNGD
USA,2015,"Consider Russia’s annexation of Crimea and further aggression in eastern Ukraine. America has few economic interests in Ukraine, and we recognize the deep and complex history between Russia and Ukraine. But we cannot stand by when the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a nation is flagrantly violated. If that happens without consequence in Ukraine, it could happen to any of the nations gathered here today. That is the basis of the sanctions that the United States and our partners impose on Russia. It is not a desire to return to a cold war.",UNGD
USA,2015,"Now, within Russia, State-controlled media may describe those events as an example of a resurgent Russia — a view shared, by the way, by a number of United States politicians and commentators who have always been deeply sceptical about Russia and seem to be convinced that a new cold war is in fact upon us. And yet look at the results. The Ukrainian people are more interested than ever in aligning with Europe instead of Russia. Sanctions have led to capital flight, a contracting economy, a fallen rouble and the emigration of more educated Russians.",UNGD
USA,2015,"Imagine if, instead, Russia had engaged in true diplomacy and worked with Ukraine and the international community to ensure that its interests were protected. That would be better for Ukraine, but also better for Russia and better for the world, which is why we continue to press for this crisis to be resolved in a way that allows a sovereign and democratic Ukraine to determine its future and control its territory. This is not because we want to isolate Russia — we do not — but because we want a strong Russia that is invested in working with us to strengthen the international system as a whole.",UNGD
USA,2015,"Similarly, in the South China Sea, the United States makes no claim on territory there. We do not adjudicate claims. But like every nation gathered here, we have an interest in upholding the basic principles of freedom of navigation and the free flow of commerce, and in resolving disputes through international law, not the law of force. So we will defend those principles, while encouraging China and other claimants to resolve their differences peacefully. I say this while recognizing that diplomacy is hard, the outcomes are sometimes unsatisfying and it is rarely politically popular. But I believe that leaders of large nations in particular have an obligation to take those risks, precisely because we are strong enough to protect our interests if and when diplomacy fails.",UNGD
USA,2015,"I also believe that to move forward in this new era, we have to be strong enough to acknowledge when what we are doing is not working. For 50 years, the United States pursued a Cuba policy that failed to improve the lives of the Cuban people. We changed that. We continue to have differences with the Cuban Government. We will continue to stand up for human rights. But we address those issues through diplomatic relations, increased commerce and people-to-people ties. As those contacts yield progress, I am confident that our Congress will inevitably lift an embargo that should not be in place any more. Change will not come overnight to Cuba, but I am confident that openness, not coercion, will support the reforms and the better life that the Cuban people deserve, just as I believe that Cuba will find its success if it pursues cooperation with other nations.",UNGD
USA,2015,"Now, if it is in the interest of major Powers to uphold international standards, that is even more true for the rest of the community of nations. Look around the world. From Singapore to Colombia to Senegal, the facts show that nations succeed when they pursue an inclusive peace and prosperity within their borders and work cooperatively with countries beyond those borders.",UNGD
USA,2015,"That path is now available to a nation such as Iran, which, as of this moment, continues to deploy violent proxies to advance its interests. Those efforts may appear to give it leverage in disputes with its neighbours, but they fuel sectarian conflict that endangers the entire region and isolates Iran from the promise of trade and commerce. The Iranian people have a proud history and are filled with extraordinary potential. But chanting “Death to America” does not create jobs or make Iran more secure. If Iran chooses a different path, that will be good for the security of the region, good for the Iranian people and good for the world.",UNGD
USA,2015,"Of course, around the globe, we will continue to be confronted with nations that reject these lessons of history — places where civil strife, border disputes and sectarian wars give rise to terrorist enclaves and humanitarian disasters. Where order has completely broken down, we must act, but we will be stronger when we act together.",UNGD
USA,2015,"In such efforts, the United States will always do its part. We will do so mindful of the lessons of the past — not just the lessons of Iraq, but also the example of Libya, where we joined an international coalition",UNGD
USA,2015,"under a United Nations mandate to prevent a slaughter. Even as we helped the Libyan people bring an end to the reign of a tyrant, our coalition could have and should have done more to fill a vacuum left behind. We are grateful to the United Nations for its efforts to forge a unity Government. We will help any legitimate Libyan Government as it works to bring the country together.",UNGD
USA,2015,"We also have to recognize that we must work more effectively in the future, as an international community, to build capacity for States that are in distress before they collapse. That is why we should celebrate the fact that, later today, the United States will join with more than 50 countries to enlist new capabilities — infantry, intelligence, helicopters, hospitals, and tens of thousands of troops — to strengthen United Nations peacekeeping. These new capabilities can prevent mass killing and ensure that peace agreements are more than words on paper. But we have to do it together. Together, we must strengthen our collective capacity to establish security where order has broken down and to support those who seek a just and lasting peace.",UNGD
USA,2015,"Nowhere is our commitment to international order more tested than in Syria. When a dictator slaughters tens of thousands of his own people, that is not just a matter of one nation’s internal affairs. It breeds human suffering on an order of magnitude that affects us all. Likewise, when a terrorist group beheads captives, slaughters the innocent and enslaves women, that is not a single nation’s national security problem. It is an assault on humankind as a whole.",UNGD
USA,2015,"I have said before and I will repeat: there is no room to accommodate an apocalyptic cult like the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), and the United States makes no apologies for using our military, as part of a broad coalition, to go after them. We do so with a determination to ensure that there will never be a safe haven for terrorists who carry out these crimes. We have demonstrated over more than a decade of relentless pursuit of Al-Qaida that we will not be outlasted by extremists.",UNGD
USA,2015,"While military power is necessary, it is not sufficient to resolve the situation in Syria. Lasting stability can take hold only when the people of Syria forge an agreement to live together peacefully. The United States is prepared to work with any nation, including Russia and Iran, to resolve the conflict. But we must recognize that after so much bloodshed, so much carnage, there cannot be a return to the pre-war status quo.",UNGD
USA,2015,"Let us remember how this started. Al-Assad reacted to peaceful protests by escalating repression and killing that, in turn, created the environment for the current strife. And so Al-Assad and his allies cannot simply pacify the broad majority of a population that has been brutalized by chemical weapons and indiscriminate bombing. Yes, realism dictates that compromise will be required to end the fighting and, ultimately, stamp out ISIL. But realism also requires a managed transition away from Al-Assad and to a new leader, and an inclusive Government that recognizes there must be an end to this chaos so that the Syrian people can begin to rebuild.",UNGD
USA,2015,"We know that ISIL — which emerged out of the chaos of Iraq and Syria — depends on perpetual war to survive, but we also know that they gain adherents because of a poisonous ideology. Part of our job, together, is to work to reject such extremism that infects too many of our young people. Part of that effort must be a continued rejection by Muslims of those who distort Islam to preach intolerance and promote violence. It must also involve a rejection by non-Muslims of the ignorance that equates Islam with terrorism.",UNGD
USA,2015,"This work will take time. There are no easy answers to Syria, and there are no simple answers to the changes that are taking place in much of the Middle East and North Africa. But so many families need help right now; they do not have time. That is why the United States is increasing the number of refugees whom we welcome within our borders. That is why we will continue to be the largest donor of assistance to support those refugees. Today we are launching new efforts to ensure that our people and our businesses, our universities and our non-governmental organizations can help as well, because in the faces of suffering families, our nation of immigrants sees itself.",UNGD
USA,2015,"Of course, in the old ways of thinking, the plight of the powerless, the plight of refugees, the plight of the marginalized did not matter. They were on the periphery of the world’s concerns. Today, our concern for them is driven not just by conscience, but should also be driven by self-interest. Helping people who have been pushed to the margins of our world is not mere charity; it is a matter of collective security. The purpose of this institution is not merely to avoid conflict; it is to galvanize the collective action that makes life better on this planet.",UNGD
USA,2015,The commitments we have made to the Sustainable Development Goals speak to this truth. I believe that ,UNGD

USA,2015,"We can roll back preventable disease and end the scourge of HIV/AIDS. We can stamp out pandemics that recognize no borders. That work may not be on television right now, but as we demonstrated in reversing the spread of Ebola, it can save more lives than anything else we can do.

USA,2015,"We can promote growth through trade that meets a higher standard, and that is what we are doing through the Trans-Pacific Partnership — a trade agreement that encompasses nearly 40 per cent of the global economy, an agreement that will open markets while protecting the rights of workers and protecting the environment that enables development to be sustained.",UNGD
USA,2015,We can roll back the pollution that we put in our skies and help economies lift people out of poverty without condemning our children to the ravages of an ever-warming climate. The same ingenuity that produced the Industrial Age and the Computer Age allows us to harness the potential of clean energy. No country can escape the ravages of climate change. And there is no stronger sign of leadership than putting future generations first. The United States will work with every nation that is willing to do its part so that we can come together in Paris to decisively confront this challenge.,UNGD
USA,2015,"Finally, regarding our vision for the future of the Assembly, my belief in moving forward rather than backwards requires us to defend the democratic principles that allow societies to succeed. Let me start from a simple premise. Catastrophes like what we are seeing in Syria do not take place in countries where there is genuine democracy and respect for the universal values this institution is supposed to defend.",UNGD
USA,2015,"I recognize that democracy is going to take different forms in different parts of the world. The very idea of a people governing themselves depends upon government giving expression to their unique culture, their unique history, their unique experiences. But some universal truths are self-evident. No person wants to be imprisoned for peaceful worship. No woman should ever be abused with impunity, no girl should be barred from attending school. There should be freedom to peacefully petition those in power without fear of arbitrary laws. These are not ideas of one country or one culture. They are fundamental to human progress. They are a cornerstone of this institution.",UNGD
USA,2015,"I realize that in many parts of the world there is a different view — a belief that strong leadership must tolerate no dissent. I hear it not only from America’s adversaries, but — privately, at least — I also hear it from some of our friends. I disagree. I believe a Government that suppresses peaceful dissent is not showing strength. It is showing weakness and it is showing fear.",UNGD
USA,2015,"History shows that regimes that fear their own people will eventually crumble, but strong institutions built on the consent of the governed endure long after any one individual is gone. That is why our strongest leaders, from George Washington to Nelson Mandela, have elevated the importance of building strong, democratic institutions over a thirst for perpetual power. Leaders who amend constitutions to stay in office only acknowledge that they failed to build a successful country for their people, because none of us lasts forever. It tells us that power is something they cling to for its own sake rather than for the betterment of those whom they purport to serve.",UNGD
USA,2015,"I understand that democracy is frustrating. Democracy in the United States is certainly imperfect. At times it can be dysfunctional. But democracy — the constant struggle to extend rights to more of our people, to give more people a voice — is what allowed us to become the most powerful nation in the world. It is not simply a matter of principle; it is not an abstraction. Democracy, inclusive democracy, makes countries stronger. When opposition parties can seek power peacefully through the ballot, a country draws upon new ideas. When a free media can inform the public, corruption and abuse are exposed and can be rooted out. When civil society thrives, communities can solve problems that Governments cannot necessarily solve alone. When immigrants are welcomed, countries are ",UNGD
USA,2015,"more productive and more vibrant. When girls can go to school, get a job and pursue unlimited opportunities, that is when a country realizes its full potential.",UNGD
USA,2015,"That is what I believe is America’s greatest strength. Not everybody in America agrees with me. That is part of democracy. I believe that the fact that one can walk the streets of this city right now and pass churches and synagogues and temples and mosques where people worship freely; the fact that our nation of immigrants mirrors the diversity of the world — one can find people from everywhere here in New York City — the fact that in this country everybody can contribute, everybody can participate no matter who they are or what they look like or whom they love — that is what makes us strong.",UNGD
USA,2015,"I believe that what is true for America is true for virtually all mature democracies. That is no accident. We can be proud of our nations without defining ourselves in opposition to some other group. We can be patriotic without demonizing someone else. We can cherish our own identities — our religion, our ethnicity, our traditions — without putting others down. Our systems are premised on the notion that absolute power will corrupt, but that people, ordinary people, are fundamentally good and value family and friendship, faith and the dignity of hard work. And with appropriate checks and balances, Governments can reflect that goodness. I believe that is the future we must seek together — to believe in the dignity of every individual, to believe we can bridge our differences and choose cooperation over conflict. That is not weakness; that is strength. It is a practical necessity in our interconnected world.",UNGD

Think of the Iranian shopkeeper who said after the nuclear deal, “God willing, now we will be able to offer many more goods at better prices”. Think of the Americans who lowered the flag over our embassy in Havana in 1961, the year I was born, and who returned this summer to raise that flag back up. One of those men said of the Cuban people, “We could do things for them, and they could do things for us. We loved them”. For 50 years we ignored that fact. Think of the families leaving everything they have known behind, risking barren deserts and stormy waters just to find shelter, just to save their children.

History is littered with the failure of false prophets and fallen empires who believed that might always makes right. That will continue to be the case. We can count on it. But we are called upon to offer a different type of leadership, a leadership strong enough to recognize that nations share common interests and people share a common humanity. And, yes, there are certain ideas and principles that are universal. That is what those who shaped the United Nations 70 years ago understood. Let us carry that faith forward into the future, for it is the only way we can ensure that the future will be brighter, for my children and for everyone’s children.",UNGD
USA,2016,"As I address the General Assembly in this Hall as President for the final time, let me recount the progress that we have made these last eight years. From the depths of the greatest financial crisis of our time, we coordinated our response to avoid further catastrophe and return the global economy to growth. We have taken away terrorist safe havens, strengthened the non-proliferation regime and resolved the Iranian nuclear issue through diplomacy. We opened relations with Cuba, helped Colombia end Latin America’s longest war, and we welcome a democratically elected leader of Myanmar to this Assembly. Our assistance is helping people feed themselves, care for the sick, power communities across Africa and promote models of development rather than dependence. We have made international institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund more representative, while establishing a framework to protect our planet from the ravages of climate change.",UNGD
USA,2016,"This is important work. It has made a real difference in the lives of our people, and it could not have happened had we not worked together. Yet around the globe we are seeing the same forces of global integration that have made us interdependent also expose deep fault lines in the existing international order. We see it in the headlines every day. Around the world, refugees flow across borders in flight from brutal conflict. Financial disruptions continue to weigh upon our workers and entire communities. Across vast swaths of the Middle East, basic security and basic order have broken down. We see too many Governments muzzling journalists, quashing dissent and censoring the flow of information. Terrorist networks use social media to prey upon the minds of our youth, endangering open societies and spurring anger against innocent immigrants and Muslims. Powerful nations contest the constraints placed on them by international law.",UNGD
USA,2016,"This is the paradox that defines our world today. A quarter century after the end of the Cold War, the world is by many measures less violent and more prosperous than ever before, and yet our societies are filled with uncertainty, unease and strife. Despite enormous progress, as people lose trust in institutions, governing becomes more difficult and tensions between nations become more quick to surface.",UNGD
USA,2016,"I therefore believe that at this moment we all face a choice. We can choose to press forward with a better model of cooperation and integration, or we can retreat into a world sharply divided, and ultimately in conflict, along age-old lines of nation, tribe, race or religion. I want to suggest today that we must go forward and not backward. I believe that as imperfect as they are, the principles of open markets, accountable governance, democracy, human rights and international law that we have forged remain the firmest foundation for human progress in this century. I make this argument not based on theory or ideology, but on facts — facts that all too often we forget in the immediacy of current events.",UNGD
USA,2016,"This is the most important fact: the integration of our global economy has made life better for billions of men, women and children. Over the last 25 years, the number of people living in extreme poverty has been cut from nearly 40 per cent of humanity to under 10 per cent. That is unprecedented, and it is not an abstraction. It means children have enough to eat; mothers do not die in childbirth.",UNGD
USA,2016,"Meanwhile, cracking the genetic code promises to cure diseases that have plagued us for centuries. The Internet can deliver the entirety of human knowledge to a young girl in a remote village on a single hand- held device. In medicine and manufacturing, in education and communications, we are experiencing a transformation of how human beings live on a scale that recalls the revolutions in agriculture and industry. As a result, a person born today is more likely to be healthy, live longer and have access to opportunity than at any time in human history. Moreover, the collapse of colonialism and communism has allowed more people than ever before to live with the freedom to choose their leaders. Despite the real and troubling areas where freedom appears to be in retreat, the fact remains that the number of democracies around the world has nearly doubled in the last 25 years.",UNGD
USA,2016,"In remote corners of the world, citizens are demanding respect for the dignity of all people no matter their gender, race, religion, disability or sexual orientation, and those who deny others dignity are subject to public reproach. An explosion of social media has given ordinary people more ways to express themselves and has raised people’s expectations for those of us in power. Indeed, our international order has been so successful that we take it as a given that great Powers no longer fight world wars, that the end of the Cold War lifted the shadow of nuclear Armageddon, that the battlefields of Europe have been replaced by peaceful union and that China and India remain on a path of remarkable growth.",UNGD
USA,2016,"I say all this not to whitewash the challenges we face or to suggest complacency. Rather, I believe that we need to acknowledge these achievements in order to summon the confidence to carry this progress forward and to make sure that we do not abandon those very things that have delivered this progress. In order to move forward, however, we do have to acknowledge that the existing path to global integration requires a course correction. All too often, those trumpeting the benefits of globalization have ignored inequality within and among nations, have ignored the enduring appeal of ethnic and sectarian identities, and have left international institutions ill-equipped, underfunded and underresourced for handling transnational challenges.",UNGD
USA,2016,"As these real problems have been neglected, alternative visions of the world have pressed forward both in the wealthiest countries and in the poorest: religious fundamentalism, the politics of ethnicity or tribe or sect, aggressive nationalism, a crude populism — sometimes from the far left, but more often from the far right — which seeks to restore what they believe was a better, simpler age free of outside contamination.",UNGD
USA,2016,"We cannot dismiss these visions. They are powerful. They reflect dissatisfaction among too many of our citizens. I do not believe those visions can deliver security or prosperity over the long term, but I do believe that these visions fail to recognize, at a very basic level, our common humanity. Moreover, I believe that the acceleration of travel, technology and telecommunications — together with a global economy that depends on a global supply chain — makes it ultimately self-defeating for those who seek to reverse this progress. Today, a nation ringed by walls would only imprison itself.",UNGD
USA,2016,"The answer cannot be a simple rejection of global integration. Instead, we must work together to make sure that the benefits of such integration are broadly shared and that the economic, political and cultural disruptions that are caused by integration are squarely addressed. This is not the place for a detailed policy blueprint, but let me offer in broad strokes those areas where I believe we must do better together.",UNGD
USA,2016,"It starts with making the global economy work better for all people and not just for those at the top. While open markets and capitalism have raised standards of living around the globe, globalization, combined with rapid progress in technology, has also weakened the position of workers and their ability to secure a decent wage. In advanced economies like my own, unions have been undermined and many manufacturing jobs have disappeared. Often, those who benefit most from globalization have used their political power to further undermine the position of workers.",UNGD
USA,2016,"In developing countries, labour organizations have often been suppressed, and the growth of the middle class has been held back by corruption and underinvestment. Mercantilist policies pursued by Governments with export-driven models threaten to undermine the consensus that underpins global trade. Meanwhile, global capital is too often unaccountable — nearly $8 trillion stashed away in tax havens, the shadow banking system that grows beyond the reach of effective oversight.",UNGD
USA,2016,"A world in which 1 per cent of humankind controls as much wealth as the other 99 per cent will never be stable. I understand that the gaps between rich and poor are not new, but just as the child in a slum today can see the skyscraper nearby, technology now allows any person with a smartphone to see how the most privileged among us live and the contrast between their own lives and others’. Expectations rise then — faster than Governments can deliver — and a pervasive sense of injustice undermines people’s faith in the system.",UNGD
USA,2016,"So how do we fix this imbalance? We cannot unwind immigration any more than we can stuff technology back into a box. Nor can we look to failed models of the past. If we start resorting to trade wars, market- distorting subsidies, beggar-thy-neighbour policies and overreliance on natural resources instead of innovation, these approaches will make us poor collectively, and they are more likely to lead to conflict. The stark contrast between, say, the success of the Republic of Korea and the wasteland of North Korea shows that the central planned control of the economy is a dead end.",UNGD
USA,2016,"But I do believe there is another path, one that fuels growth and innovation and offers the clearest route to individual opportunity and national success. It does not require succumbing to a soulless capitalism that benefits only the few, but rather recognizes that economies are more successful when we close the gap between rich and poor and growth is broadly based. That means respecting the rights of workers so that they can organize into independent unions and earn a living wage. It means investing in our people, their skills, their education, their capacity to take an idea and turn it into a business. It means strengthening the safety net that protects our people from hardship and allows them to take more risks to look for a new job or start a new venture.",UNGD
USA,2016,"These are the policies that I pursued here in the United States and with clear results. American businesses have now created 15 million new jobs. After the recession, the top 1 per cent of Americans were capturing more than 90 per cent of income growth, but today that is down to roughly half. Last year, poverty in this country fell at the fastest rate in nearly 50 years. With further investment in infrastructure and early childhood education and basic research, I am confident that such progress will continue.",UNGD
USA,2016,"So just as I pursued these measures here at home, so the United States has worked with many nations to curb the excesses of capitalism, not to punish wealth, but to prevent repeated crises that can destroy it. That is why we have worked with other nations to create higher and clearer standards for banking and taxation, because a society that asks less of oligarchs than of ordinary citizens will rot from within.",UNGD
USA,2016,"That is why we have pushed for transparency and cooperation in rooting out corruption and tracking illicit dollars, because markets create more jobs when they are fuelled by hard work and not the capacity to extort and bribe. That is why we have worked to reach trade agreements that raise labour standards and raise environmental standards, as we have done with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, so that the benefits are more broadly shared.",UNGD
USA,2016,"Just as we benefit by combating inequality within our countries, so I believe advanced economies still need to do more to close the gap between rich and poor nations around the globe. This is difficult politically. It is difficult to spend on foreign assistance, but I do not believe this is charity. For a small fraction of what we spent on the war in Iraq, we could support institutions so that fragile States do not collapse in the first place and invest in emerging economies that become markets for our goods. It is not just the right thing to do; it is the smart thing to do.",UNGD
USA,2016,"That is why we need to follow through on our efforts to combat climate change. If we do not act boldly, the bill that could come due will be mass migrations, cities submerged, nations displaced, food supplies decimated and conflicts borne of despair. The Paris Agreement on Climate Change gives us a framework to act, but only if we scale up our ambitions. There must be a sense of urgency about bringing the Agreement into force and helping poorer countries leapfrog destructive forms of energy.",UNGD
USA,2016,"For the wealthiest countries, therefore, a green climate fund should be just the beginning. We need to invest in research and provide market incentives to develop new technologies and then make those technologies accessible and affordable for poor countries. Only then can we continue lifting all people up from poverty without condemning our children to a planet beyond their capacity to repair it.",UNGD
USA,2016,"We therefore need new models for the global marketplace, models that are inclusive and sustainable. In the same way, we need models of governance that are inclusive and accountable to ordinary people. I recognize that not every country in this Hall is going to follow the same model of governance. I do not think that America can or should impose our system of government on other countries, but there appears to be a growing contest between authoritarianism and liberalism right now. I want everybody to understand, I am not neutral in that contest. I believe in a liberal political order, an order built not just through elections and representative government, but also through respect for human rights and civil society and independent judiciaries and the rule of law.",UNGD
USA,2016,"I know that some countries that now recognize the power of free markets still reject the model of free societies. Perhaps those of us who have been promoting democracy feel somewhat discouraged since the end of the cold war, because we have learned that liberal democracy will not just wash across the globe in a single wave. It turns out that building accountable institutions is hard work, the work of generations. The gains are often fragile. Sometimes we take one step forward and then two steps back. In countries held together by borders drawn by colonial Powers, with ethnic enclaves and tribal divisions, politics and elections can sometimes appear to be a zero-sum game.",UNGD
USA,2016,"So, given the difficulty in forging true democracy in the face of these pressures, it is no surprise that some argue that the future favours the strong man, a top-down model, rather than strong democratic institutions. But I believe this thinking is wrong. I believe that the road of true democracy remains the better path. I believe that, in the twenty-first century, economies can only grow to a certain point until they need to open up, because entrepreneurs need to access information in order to invent, young people need a global education in order to thrive, independent media needs to check the abuses of power. Without this evolution, the expectations of people will ultimately not be met. Suppression and stagnation will set in. And history shows that strong men are then left with two paths: permanent crackdown, which sparks strife at home, or scapegoating enemies abroad, which can lead to war.",UNGD
USA,2016,"I will admit that my belief that Governments should serve the individual and not the other way around is shaped by America’s story. Our nation began with the promise of freedom that applied only to the few, but because of our democratic Constitution, because of our Bill of Rights, because of our ideals, ordinary people were able to organize and march and protest. And ultimately those ideals won out and opened doors for women, minorities and workers in ways that made our economy more productive and turned our diversity into a strength. It gave innovators the chance to transform every area of human endeavour. It made it possible for someone like me to be elected President of the United States.",UNGD
USA,2016,"So, yes, my views are shaped by the specific experiences of America, but I do not think this story is unique to America. Look at the transformation that has taken place in countries as different as Japan, Chile, Indonesia and Botswana. The countries that have succeeded are ones in which people feel they have a stake. In Europe, the progress of those countries in the former Soviet bloc that embraced democracy stand in clear contrast to those that did not. After all, the people of Ukraine did not take to the streets because of some plot imposed from abroad. They took to the streets because their leadership was for sale and they had no recourse. They demanded change because they saw life get better for the people in the Baltics and in Poland, societies that were more liberal and democratic and open than their own.",UNGD
USA,2016,"So those of us who believe in democracy need to speak out forcefully because both the facts and history, I believe, are on our side. That does not mean that democracies are not without flaws. It does mean that the cure for what ails our democracies is greater engagement by our citizens, not less. Yes, in America, there is too much money in politics, too much entrenched partisanship, too little participation by citizens, in part because of a patchwork of laws that makes it harder to vote.",UNGD
USA,2016,"In Europe, a well-intentioned Brussels often became too isolated from the normal push-and-pull of national politics. Too often in capitals decision-makers have forgotten that democracy needs to be driven by civic engagement from the bottom up, not governance by experts from the top down. So these are real problems. As leaders of democratic Governments make the case for democracy abroad, we had better strive harder to set a better example at home.",UNGD
USA,2016,"Moreover, every country will organize its Government informed by centuries of history, the circumstances of geography and the deeply held beliefs of its people. So I recognize that a traditional society may value unity and cohesion more than a diverse country like my own, which was founded upon what at the time was a radical idea, the idea of the liberty of individual human beings endowed with certain God-given rights. But that does not mean that ordinary people in Asia or Africa or the Middle East somehow prefer arbitrary rule that denies them a voice in the decisions that can shape their lives. I believe that spirit is universal. If anyone doubts the universality of that desire, listen to the voices of young people everywhere who call out for freedom and dignity and the opportunity to control their own lives.",UNGD
USA,2016,"This leads me to the third thing we need to do. We must reject any forms of fundamentalism or racism or belief in ethnic superiority that makes our traditional identities irreconcilable with modernity. Instead, we need to embrace the tolerance that results from respect for all human beings. It is a truism that global integration has led to a collision of cultures. Trade, migration, the Internet — all these things can challenge and unsettle our most cherished identities. We see liberal societies express opposition when women choose to cover themselves. We see protests responding to Western newspaper cartoons that caricature the Prophet Mohammed.",UNGD
USA,2016,"In a world that left the age of empire behind, we see Russia attempting to recover lost glory through force. Asian powers debate competing claims of history. And in Europe and the United States, we see people wrestle with concerns about immigration and changing demographics, suggesting that somehow people who look different are corrupting the character of our countries. There is no easy answer for resolving all these social forces, and we must respect the meaning that people draw from their own traditions, from their religion, from their ethnicity, from their sense of nationhood. But I do not believe progress is possible if our desire to preserve our identities gives way to an impulse to dehumanize or dominate another group.",UNGD
USA,2016,"If our religion leads us to persecute those of another faith, if we jail or beat people who are gay, if our traditions lead us to prevent girls from going to school, if we discriminate on the basis of race, tribe or ethnicity, then the fragile bonds of civilization will fray. The world is too small. We are too packed together for us to be able to resort to those old ways of thinking.",UNGD
USA,2016,"We see this mindset in too many parts of the Middle East. So much of the collapse in order there has been fuelled because leaders sought legitimacy, not because of policies or programmes, but by resorting to persecuting political opposition, or demonizing other religious sects, by narrowing the public space to the mosque, where in too many places perversions of a great faith were tolerated. And these forces built up for years. They are now at work helping to fuel both Syria’s tragic civil war and the mindless medieval menace of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). The mindset of sectarianism, extremism, blood-letting and retribution that has been taking place will not be quickly reversed. If we are honest, we will understand that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to coexist for long. But I do believe we have to be honest about the nature of these conflicts. Our international community must continue to work with those who seek to build rather than to destroy. And there is a military component to that, which means being united and relentless in destroying networks like ISIL, which show no respect for human life. But it also means that in a place like Syria, where there is no ultimate military victory to be won, we are going to have to pursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence, deliver aid to those in need, and support those who pursue a political settlement and can see those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect.",UNGD
USA,2016,"Across the region’s conflicts, we have to insist that all parties recognize a common humanity and that nations end proxy wars that fuel disorder, because until basic questions are answered about how communities coexist, the embers of extremism will continue to burn, countless human beings will suffer — most of all in that region — and extremism will continue to be exported overseas. And the world is too small for us to simply be able to build a wall and prevent it from affecting our own societies.",UNGD
USA,2016,"And what is true in the Middle East is true for all of us. Surely religious traditions can be honoured and upheld while teaching young people science and math, rather than intolerance. Surely we can sustain our unique traditions while giving women their full and rightful role in the politics and economics of a nation. Surely we can rally our nations to solidarity while recognizing equal treatment for all communities — whether it is a religious minority in Myanmar or an ethnic minority in Burundi or a racial minority right here in the United States. And surely, Israelis and Palestinians will be better off if Palestinians reject incitement and recognize the legitimacy of Israel, and Israel recognizes that it cannot permanently occupy and settle Palestinian land. We all have to do better as leaders in tamping down, rather than encouraging, a notion of identity that leads us to diminish others.",UNGD
USA,2016,"And this leads me to the fourth and final thing we need to do, and that is sustain our commitment to international cooperation rooted in the rights and responsibilities of nations. As President of the United States, I know that for most of human history, power has not been unipolar. The end of the Cold War may have led too many to forget this truth. I have noticed as President that, at times, both America’s adversaries and some of our allies believe that all problems were either caused by Washington or could be solved by Washington, and perhaps too many in Washington believed that as well.",UNGD
USA,2016,"But I believe that America has been a rare super- Power in human history insofar as it has been willing to think beyond narrow self-interest, that while we have made our share of mistakes over these last 25 years – and I have acknowledged some – we have strived, sometimes at great sacrifice, to align better our actions with our ideals. And as a consequence, I believe we have been a force for good.",UNGD
USA,2016,"We have secured allies. We have acted to protect the vulnerable. We have supported human rights and welcomed scrutiny of our own actions. We have bound our power to international laws and institutions. When we have made mistakes, we have tried to acknowledge them. We have worked to roll back poverty, hunger and disease beyond our borders, not just within our borders.",UNGD
USA,2016,"I am proud of that. But I also know that we cannot do this alone. And I believe that if we are to meet the challenges of this century, we are all going to have to do more to build up international capacity. We cannot escape the prospect of nuclear war unless we all commit to stopping the spread of nuclear weapons and pursuing a world without them. When Iran agrees to accept constraints on its nuclear programme, that enhances global security and enhances Iran’s ability to work with other nations. On the other hand, when North Korea tests a bomb that endangers all of us. And any country that breaks this basic bargain must face consequences. And those nations with these weapons, like the United States, have a unique responsibility to pursue the path of reducing our stockpiles and reaffirming basic norms, like the commitment to never test them again.",UNGD
USA,2016,"We cannot combat a disease like zika that recognizes no borders – mosquitos do not respect walls – unless we make permanent the same urgency that we brought to bear against Ebola – by strengthening our own systems of public health, by investing in cures, rolling back the root causes of disease and helping poorer countries develop their public health infrastructures.",UNGD
USA,2016,"We can only eliminate extreme poverty if the Sustainable Development Goals that we have set are more than words on paper. Human ingenuity now gives us the capacity to feed the hungry and give all of our children – including our girls – the education that is the foundation for opportunity in our world. But we have to put our money where our mouths are. And we can only realize the promise of this institution’s founding – to replace the ravages of war with cooperation – if powerful nations like my own accept constraints. Sometimes I am criticized in my own country for professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions. But I am convinced that in the long run, giving up some freedom of action – not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core interests, but binding ourselves to international rules over the long term – enhances our security. And I think that is not true just for us.",UNGD
USA,2016,"If Russia continues to interfere in the affairs of its neighbours, it may be popular at home and it may fuel nationalist fervour for a time, but over time it is also going to diminish its stature and make its borders less secure. In the South China Sea, a peaceful resolution of disputes offered by law will mean far greater stability than the militarization of a few rocks and reefs.",UNGD
USA,2016,"We are all stakeholders in this international system, and it calls upon all of us to invest in the success of institutions to which we belong. And the good news is that many nations have shown what kind of progress is possible when we make those commitments. Consider what we have accomplished at the United Nations over the past few years. Together, we mobilized some 50,000 additional troops for United Nations peacekeeping, making them nimble, better equipped, better prepared to deal with emergencies. Together we established an Open Government Partnership so that, increasingly, transparency empowers more and more people around the globe. And together, now, we have to open our hearts and do more to help refugees who are desperate for a home.",UNGD
USA,2016,"We should all welcome the pledges of increased assistance that have been made at this General Assembly gathering. I will be discussing that more this afternoon, but we have to follow through, even when the politics are hard, because, in the eyes of innocent men and women and children who, through no fault of their own, have had to flee everything that they know, everything that they love, we have to have the empathy to see ourselves. We have to imagine what it would be like for our family, for our children, if the unspeakable happened to us. And we should all understand that, ultimately, our world will be more secure if we are prepared to help those in need and the nations that are carrying the largest burden with respect to accommodating these refugees.",UNGD
USA,2016,"There are a lot of nations right now that are doing the right thing, but many nations — particularly those blessed with wealth and the benefits of geography — that can do more to offer a hand, even if they also insist that refugees who come to our countries have to do more to adapt to the customs and conventions of the communities that are now providing them a home.",UNGD
USA,2016,"Let me conclude by saying that I recognize that history tells a different story than the one that I have talked about here today. There is a much darker and more cynical view of history that we can adopt. Human beings are too often motivated by greed and by power. Big countries for most of history have pushed smaller ones around. Tribes, ethnic groups and nation States have very often found it most convenient to define themselves by what they hate and not just those ideas that bind them together.",UNGD
USA,2016,"Time and again, human beings have believed that they finally arrived at a period of enlightenment only to then repeat cycles of conflict and suffering. Perhaps that is our fate. We have to remember that the choices of individual human beings led to repeated world war, but we also have to remember that the choices of individual human beings created the United Nations so that a war like that would never happen again. Each of us as leaders and each nation can choose to reject those who appeal to our worst impulses and embrace those who appeal to our best, for we have shown that we can choose a better history.",UNGD

It is based on the vision that diverse nations could cooperate to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security and promote their prosperity. It was in the same period, exactly 70 years ago, that the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe, based on the three beautiful pillars of peace, sovereignty and security, and prosperity.

All responsible leaders have an obligation to serve their own citizens, and the nation State remains the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.

It has turned a wealthy country with a rich history and culture into an economically depleted rogue State whose chief exports are violence, bloodshed and chaos.

USA,2017,"The United States continues to lead the world in humanitarian assistance, including famine prevention and relief in South Sudan, Somalia, northern Nigeria and Yemen. We have invested in better health and opportunity all over the world through programmes like the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the President’s Malaria Initiative, the Global Health Security Agenda, the Global Fund to End Modern Slavery, and the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative, which is part of our commitment to empowering women all across the globe.",UNGD
USA,2017,"We also thank the Secretary-General for recognizing that the United Nations must reform if it is to be an effective partner in confronting threats to sovereignty, security and prosperity. Too often the focus of the Organization has not been on results, but on bureaucracy and process. In some cases, States that seek to subvert this institution’s noble ends have hijacked the very systems that are supposed to advance them. For example, it is a massive source of embarrassment to the United Nations that some Governments with egregious human rights records sit on the United Nations Human Rights Council.",UNGD
USA,2017,"The United States is one of 193 countries in the United Nations, and yet we pay 22 per cent of the entire budget and more. In fact, we pay far more than anybody realizes. The United States bears an unfair cost burden, but, to be fair, if it could actually accomplish all of its stated goals, especially the goal of peace, this investment would easily be well worth it.",UNGD
USA,2017,"Major portions of the world are in conflict, and some in fact are going to hell, but the powerful people in this Hall, under the guidance and auspices of the United Nations, can solve many of these vicious and complex problems. The American people hope that one day soon the United Nations can be a much more accountable and effective advocate for human dignity and freedom around the world. In the meantime, we believe that no nation should have to bear a disproportionate share of the burden — militarily or financially.",UNGD
USA,2017,"Nations of the world must take a greater role in promoting secure and prosperous societies in their own regions. That is why, in the western hemisphere, the United States has stood against the corrupt destabilizing regime in Cuba and embraced the enduring dream of the Cuban people to live in freedom. My Administration recently announced that we will not lift sanctions on the Cuban Government until it makes fundamental reforms.",UNGD
USA,2017,"We have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the socialist Maduro regime in Venezuela, which has brought a once-thriving nation to the brink of total collapse. The socialist dictatorship of Nicolás Maduro Moros has inflicted terrible pain and suffering on the good people of that country. This corrupt regime destroyed a prosperous nation by imposing a failed ideology that has produced poverty and misery everywhere it has been tried. To make matters worse, Maduro has defied his own people, stealing power from their elected representatives to preserve his disastrous rule.",UNGD
USA,2017,"The Venezuelan people are starving, and their country is collapsing. Their democratic institutions are being destroyed. This situation is completely unacceptable, and we cannot stand by and watch. As a responsible neighbour and friend, we, together with all others, have a goal: to help them regain their freedom, recover their country and restore their democracy.",UNGD
USA,2017,I would like to thank leaders in this Hall for condemning the regime and providing vital support to the Venezuelan people. The United States has taken important steps to hold the regime accountable. We are prepared to take further action if the Government of Venezuela persists on its path to impose authoritarian rule on the Venezuelan people.,UNGD
USA,2017,We are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy trade relationships with many of the Latin American countries gathered here today. Our economic bond forms a critical foundation for advancing peace and prosperity for all of our peoples and all of our neighbours. I ask every country represented here today to be prepared to do more to address this very real crisis. We call for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in Venezuela.,UNGD
USA,2017,"The problem in Venezuela is not that socialism has been poorly implemented, but that socialism has been faithfully implemented. From the Soviet Union to Cuba to Venezuela, wherever true socialism or communism has been adopted, it has delivered anguish and devastation and failure. Those who preach the tenets of those discredited ideologies only contribute to the continued suffering of the people who live under those cruel systems. America stands with every person living under a brutal regime. Our respect for sovereignty is also a call for action.",UNGD
USA,2017,"All people deserve a Government that cares for their safety, their interests and their well-being, including their prosperity. In America, we seek stronger ties of business and trade with all nations of goodwill, but that trade must be fair and it must be reciprocal. For too long the American people were told that mammoth multinational trade deals, unaccountable international tribunals and powerful global bureaucracies were the best way to promote their success. But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs vanished and thousands of factories disappeared. Others gamed the system and broke the rules, and our great middle class, once the bedrock of American prosperity, was forgotten and left behind. But they are forgotten no more, and they will never be forgotten again.",UNGD
USA,2017,"While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing our commitment to the first duty of every Government: the duty to our citizens. This bond is the source of America’s strength and that of every responsible nation represented here today. If the Organization is to have any hope of successfully confronting the challenges before us, it will depend, as President Truman said some 70 years ago, on the independent strength of its Members. If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and overcome the present dangers together, there can be no substitute for strong, sovereign and independent nations, nations that are rooted in their histories and invested in their destinies; nations that seek allies to befriend, not enemies to conquer; and most important of all, nations that are home to patriots, to men and women who are willing to sacrifice for their countries, their fellow citizens and for all that is best in the human spirit.",UNGD
USA,2017,"In remembering the great victory that led to this body’s founding, we must never forget that those heroes who fought against evil also fought for the nations that they love. Patriotism led the Poles to die to save Poland, the French to fight for a free France and the Brits to stand strong for Britain. Today if we do not invest ourselves, our hearts and our minds in our nations, if we will not build strong families, safe communities and healthy societies for ourselves, no one can do it for us. We cannot wait for someone else, for faraway countries or far-off bureaucracies. We cannot do it.",UNGD
USA,2017,"We must solve our problems to build our prosperity, to secure our future, or we will be vulnerable to decay, domination and defeat. The true question for the United Nations today, for people all over the world who hope for better lives for themselves and their children is a basic one: are we still patriots? Do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty and to take ownership of their futures? Do we revere them enough to defend their interests, preserve their cultures and ensure a peaceful world for their citizens?",UNGD
USA,2017,"One of the greatest American patriots, John Adams, wrote that the American Revolution was effected before the war commenced. The Revolution was in the minds and hearts of the people. That was the moment when America awoke, when we looked around and understood that we were a nation. We realized who we were, what we valued and what we would give our lives to defend. From its very first moments, the American story is the story of what is possible when people take ownership of their future. The United States of America has been among the greatest forces for good in the history of the world and the greatest defenders of sovereignty, security and prosperity for all.",UNGD
USA,2017,"Now we are calling for a great reawakening of nations, for the revival of their spirits, their pride, their people and their patriotism. History is asking us whether we are up to the task. Our answer will be a renewal of will, a rediscovery of resolve and a rebirth of devotion. We need to defeat the enemies of humankind and unlock the potential of life itself. Our hope is a word and a world of proud, independent nations that embrace their duties, seek friendship, respect others and make common cause in the greatest shared interest of all, a future of dignity and peace for the people of this wonderful Earth. This is the true vision of the United Nations, the ancient wish of every people and the deepest yearning that lives inside every sacred soul.",UNGD
USA,2017,"So let this be our mission and let this be our message to the world: we will fight together, sacrifice together and stand together for peace, for freedom, for justice, for family, for humankind and for the Almighty God who made us all.",UNGD
USA,2017,God bless the nations of the world and God bless the United States of America.,UNGD
